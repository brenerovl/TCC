House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady of Texas said that an Obamacare replacement proposal would be laid out on a step-by-step basis and could be fully written by the August recess.The Obama administration immediately hit back with the comment that the Senate vote was passed by a  pretty narrow margin Josh Earnest went on to say that the Republicans will be responsible for the ensuing chaos LOL!

501, WATCH: Kellyanne Conway Very Upset Hillary Clinton Is Not Doing Trump’s Job,"White House counselor Kellyanne Conway crawled out of her crypt after two weeks in hiding to attack Hillary Clinton who is totally not the President. Former reality show star Donald Trump was sworn in 216 days ago (seems longer, huh?) and his administration is still talking about his former rival. It s not too surprising since Trump is still in campaign mode, holding rallies, likely because he still doesn t know how to President.On Thursday, Conway appeared on  Fox & Friends  to lash out at Trump s critics, the media, and Hillary Clinton for daring to write a book because books are bad, apparently. Where s her big c4 trying to help women and children around the globe?  Conway asked as if the Clinton Foundation which helps women and children around the globe does not exist.Conway then just wondered why Clinton is not doing Trump s job. Where s her bipartisan effort to try to help with infrastructure and meaningful tax reform, or the opioid crisis that I work on in the building behind me every single day?  Conway asked.Trump s policies and attempted legislation have failed to pass. There s been an exodus of staffers at various councils after his appalling speech on the Charlottesville attack which left one dead and 19 others injured. Thanks, Hillary!Someone, please tell Trump that Hillary Clinton is not holding an elected office. Passing infrastructure bills and handling the opioid crisis is all on Trump. Eradicating Obamacare would have a devastating effect on those suffering from the disease of addiction who wish to get treatment. Thanks again, Hillary.Conway then claimed that Hillary Clinton  failed to make history,  even though she won the popular vote and was the first woman to become the presidential nominee of a major party in the U.S.Watch: It s way over the line.   @KellyannePolls reacts to James Clapper questioning Pres.

3492," GOP Gives Trump The Middle Finger, Prepares To Launch Probe Into Russia","Donald Trump may have decided that Russia is going to be America s new BFF, but the rest of the GOP isn t so sure. Going against the incoming administration, several Republicans are preparing to launch a wide-ranging investigation into Russia, particularly their involvement with hacking and alleged interference in the presidential election.The Washington Post reported:Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (Ariz.) is readying a probe of possible Russian cyber-incursions into U.S. weapons systems, and he said he has been discussing the issue with Senate Select Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr (N.C.), with whom he will be  working closely  to investigate Russia s suspected interference in the U.S. elections and cyberthreats to the military and other institutions. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has been apprised of the discussions. Burr did not respond to requests for comment.Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) also said he intends to hold hearings next year into alleged Russian hacking. Corker is on Trump s shortlist for secretary of state, according to the Trump transition team.Two of the most vocal voices on team Probe Putin are McCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham.Graham said that Russia will  keep doing more here until they pay a price.  Next year, he plans to head up legislation and hold investigative hearings on  Russia s misadventures throughout the world,  which will absolutely include Russian interference in the U.S. election. I m going after Russia in every way you can go after Russia. I think they re one of the most destabilizing influences on the world stage. I think they did interfere with our elections, and I want Putin personally to pay the price,  Graham told CNN on Wednesday.McCain said his Armed Services Committee is going to be investigating Russia s cyber capabilities and the extent that they could be used against the U.S. military and our weapons systems,  because the real threat is cyber.  McCain added that this investigation will probably veer off to include looking at the possibility Russia was behind the DNC hacking. Also on the list to be probed is the hacking of state-based election systems, including that of Arizona, McCain s home state. See, the problem with hacking is that if they re able to disrupt elections, then it s a national security issue, obviously,  McCain said on Thursday.He noted that the Armed Services Committee was  still formulating  just exactly how they would go about dealing with the issue, but said   there s very little doubt  that Russia was meddling in the U.S. election process, which he insists is very worthy of examination. Trump has dismissed the possibility that Russia was responsible for the DNC hacking, despite the fact that he himself called on the country to find  Hillary Clinton s missing emails. I don t believe they interfered,  Trump said.  It could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey. I believe that it could have been Russia and it could have been any one of many other people. Sources or even individuals. Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images and Thierry Chesnot/Getty Images.

1510, Trump Displays Incredible Ignorance Yet Again — Claims Credit For Term Coined Over A Hundred Years Ago,"Have you ever wondered where a phrase started? How about the phrase  prime the pump?  It is widely considered to mean the use of government money to get a project going. While it dates back to the 1800s, President Donald Trump is now claiming that he invented the phrase. In reality, the use of the phrase  prime the pump  predates Trump s own birth by a hundred years, and the use of it in the current economic sense has existed since the 1930s.In a recent conversation with The Economist, this exchange happened (they were talking about Trump s tax plan):The Economist: But beyond that it s OK if the tax plan increases the deficit? Trump: It is OK, because it won t increase it for long. You may have two years where you ll you understand the expression  prime the pump ? The Economist: Yes. Trump: We have to prime the pump. The Economist: It s very Keynesian. Trump: We re the highest-taxed nation in the world. Have you heard that expression before, for this particular type of an event? The Economist: Priming the pump? Trump: Yeah, have you heard it? The Economist: Yes. Trump: Have you heard that expression used before? Because I haven t heard it. I mean, I just I came up with it a couple of days ago and I thought it was good. It s what you have to do.According to The Free Dictionary:Prime the Pump: Encourage the growth or action of something, as in  Marjorie tried to prime the pump by offering some new issues for discussion.  In the late 1800s this expression originally was used for pouring liquid into a pump to expel the air and make it work. In the 1930s it was applied to government efforts to stimulate the economy and thereafter was applied to other undertakings.It is hardly surprising that a) Trump had never heard this phrase, as it is rarely used on Twitter and b) he would take credit for it. In a week with so many gaffes, lies and just strange behavior, this may not be as big an issue but it s clear how little this man knows and how little he understands the world and reality that the rest of us live in. Another explanation could be that Trump is much, much older than we have been led to believe and has gone completely senile.Featured image via Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images.",News,"May 11, 2017"
3296, Anthony Bourdain Reveals The ‘ONE Good Thing’ About Trump And It’s HILARIOUS,"While Donald Trump is currently freaking out because he hasn t been able to find anyone to perform at his inauguration (which is just a few short weeks away at this point), master chef Anthony Bourdain is making sure he rubs salt in Trump s open wounds.Never one to mince his words, Bourdain first asserted himself as an anti-Trump celebrity when he was asked if he d ever dine with Trump during his presidential campaign. Bourdain s reply was blunt and brutal   he said, Absolutely f*cking not. And Bourdain hasn t changed his tone about Trump, not even after the phony business mogul has been elected. In a recent interview with Eater s Helen Rosner, Bourdain further confirmed that he is as anti-Trump as ever. During the interview, Bourdain clearly stated that he was concerned about what Trump s presidency meant for his daughter   rightfully so, as any parent should be. But while Trump s presidency means horrible things for many people who aren t rich white men, Bourdain was able to find one silver lining.In stating that he would never attend Trump s White House Correspondents  dinner, Bourdain stated that at least Trump would probably put an end to it. He said: I doubt there will be another. Thank god, that s an institution I d like to see die for years. If there s one good thing to come out of the Trump administration, let it be that there will be no more White House Correspondents  dinners. It reinforces all the world s worst notions about the hideous, inside-the-beltway, all-in-it-together culture. It brings honor to no one to have Kim Kardashian or Tara Reid sitting there next to a news anchor. What is this all about? F*ck that. If I m gonna make fun of you today, I m not accepting your food tomorrow. I had dinner with President Obama, but I paid. We were offered Air Force One, and I said,  There s no way. No way. Well, he s probably right. Not only would there be several empty seats, but the only people who would actually attend would be swamp monsters just like Trump. This is surely going to be one sour reminder to Trump that he is extremely unpopular and will never be accepted in the way that President Barack Obama was embraced by most of America.

17798,TRUMP HITS BACK After Cowgirl Congresswoman Trashes Him Over Words Said to Grieving Widow,"The left is going ballistic over supposed words said by President Trump to a grieving military widow.  President Trump made a call to Myeshia Wilson that s been turned into a political football by the left to make Trump out to be  crazy . Wilson s husband was killed in Niger while serving in our military so President Trump was making a sympathy call to Mrs. Wilson. Unfortunately, Wilson s family has been put in the middle of an effort to bash Trump.The media also wasted no time covering this story. They re doing their best to try and make Trump look as bad as possible Just another day in the life of the lefty media.Far left Congresswoman  Frederica Wilson jumped right in to trash Trump after the call. She s following the left s narrative by claiming Trump is a  sick man .  It s pretty funny that Wilson calls Trump crazy while wearing a glittery cowgirl hat 24/7.The  Resist  movement includes Wilson who refused to go to Trump s inauguration. Wilson also attacked the president in May when she said said he  needs psychological help and is desperate for attention.  Perhaps Cowgirl Wilson should look in the mirror .According to left leaning propaganda news NBC: He said,  But you know he must ve known what he signed up for,  the Democrat recounted Trump saying more than once during the call to express his sympathy. According to Wilson, the conversation lasted somewhere from three to five minutes. Everyone knows when you go to war you could possibly not come back alive but you don t remind a grieving widow of that,  Wilson said.  That s so insensitive. Trump  didn t even remember his name,  Wilson recalled Myeshia Johnson telling her after the call ended, the congresswoman told MSNBC s  Morning Joe  Wednesday. She hung up the phone and said,  He didn t even remember his name,  Wilson said.  That s the hurting part. The White House said Tuesday that the president had called the families of all four service members who were killed.  He offered condolences on behalf of a grateful nation and assured them their family s extraordinary sacrifice to the country will never be forgotten,  the White House said.Asked about Wilson s characterization of the call, a White House official said Tuesday night that  the president s conversations with the families of American heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice are private. PETE HEGSETH POINTED OUT THAT THIS IS HOW FAR THE LEFT WILL GO TO TRASH TRUMP:Pete Hegseth said on  Fox & Friends  that this is another example of Trump s opponents taking every opportunity to twist or spin his words, even if it involves a fallen soldier. They want to question at every turn what he says he s committed to,  Hegseth said.  There s no one more committed, I believe, to our service members, to our veterans than this president. He said this shows how committed Democrats are to resisting Trump no matter what.TRUMP HITS BACK:Trump hit back at the claims saying he has proof of what was said on the call:Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2017Wilson took no time in shooting back that Trump is a  sick man . She s clearly milking this for all it s worth. It s sick that this Democrat would use this call to a grieving widow to bash our president.",left-news,"Oct 18, 2017"

6087, Why This Attorney General Is Going After Trump For ‘Fraud’,"New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman isn t going to allow Donald Trump s 2016 presidential campaign get in the way of his ongoing prosecution of the GOP frontrunner for  fraud. Schneiderman is the highest profile government official looking into Trump s shady business dealings at Trump University. Customers claim that after they signed up for the opportunity, they were pressured to spend ever-increasing amounts of money with little knowledge of the real estate business to show for it.In an interview with ABC, the attorney general explained that he s not going to back off. We re ready to go,  Schneiderman, a Democrat, told ABC News today.  We sued him long before anyone thought he might run for President. This is not a political case, it s just a straight-up fraud case. Like the judge also looking into the case, Scneiderman has come in for attack by Trump, who has used his high profile to impugn the prosecutor s motives. But that hasn t dissuaded the prosecutor.Schneiderman told ABC News he is not worrying about the confluence of the campaign and his case. The documents, he said only served to offer further proof that the operation was aimed less at teaching students the skills needed to buy and sell real state, and more about making money for Trump. It was clearly a way to separate people who were desperate to make money in hard economic times from their own cash and to get it into the pocket of Mr. Trump and his cronies,  Schneiderman said.The secret Trump University documents have revealed that workers at the operation were given a step-by-step manual on how to convince prospective  students  to give the company access to their money and also explained how to prey on their emotions in pursuit of profits. Trump University is now defunct, after Trump and his partners made money off of regular people, all while egging students on to profit from the 2007-8 real estate collapse.Featured image via YouTube",News,"May 31, 2016"

22940,Billionaire ‘Bilderberger’ David Rockefeller dead at 101," The Trilateral Commission is international and is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the United States. The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power   political, monetary, intellectual and ecclesiastical.      Senator Barry Goldwater, from his book  With No Apologies 21st Century Wire says Controversial globalist and banker David Rockefeller has died at 101 years of age.Rockefeller has been described as a philanthropist and banker, yet much of his legacy will forever be tied to the creation of the well-known think-tank the Council on Foreign Relations, The Trilateral Commission and his central role on the steering committee for the secretive Bilderberg Group established in 1954.The Bilderberg Group has often been passed off as an insignificant gathering of corporate CEO s, barons of oil, government top brass and royalty   most mainstream outlets still continue to mask the group s influence on foreign policy and world finance   but thankfully their exploits have been slowly uncovered with each passing year, as the list of attendees seem to change and grow with each new conference location.For those who still doubt there s a hidden element directing global interests, one only needs to look into the high-powered pursuits of Bilderberg attendees that have been linked to creating a multi-national sovereignty override through many transnational corporations with world trade partnerships like the Transatlantic partnership (TTIP) and Transpacific partnership (TPP), which now excludes the US via an executive order from Donald Trump.The following passage is from the NY Times: He spent his life in the club of the ruling class and was loyal to members of the club, no matter what they did,  The New York Times columnist David Brooks wrote in 2002, citing the profitable deals Mr. Rockefeller had cut with  oil-rich dictators,   Soviet party bosses  and  Chinese perpetrators of the Cultural Revolution. There was also an immense sphere of influence held by various power-hungry groups such as The Trilateral Commission, brought to fruition in 1973 by David Rockefeller and perennial foreign policy advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski. The Commission was also joined by fellow Bilderberg attendee and longtime policy advisor Henry Kissinger. Contrary to what most people think   the vast majority of The Trilateral Commission s members have been from countries outside of America.Rockefeller, like George Soros, is ultimately tied to globalism and vast social engineering programs.More from RT below  (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)Billionaire banker David Rockefeller dies aged 101RTRockefeller died in his sleep at home in Pocantico Hills, New York, on Monday morning as a result of congestive heart failure, according to a family spokesperson Fraser P. Seitel.The businessman, who had an estimated fortune of $3 billion, retired as head of Chase Manhattan in 1981 after a 35-year career.In the statement from the The Rockefeller Foundation confirming his death, Rockefeller was described as  one of the most influential figures in the history of American philanthropy and finance, considered by many to be  America s last great international business statesman .   Rockefeller, also known as  the banker s banker , according to the statement, is said to have donated almost $2 billion over his lifetime to various institutions including Rockefeller University, Harvard University and art museum.David was the youngest of six children born to John D. Rockefeller Jr. and the grandson of Standard Oil co-founder John D. Rockefeller.Rockefeller graduated from Harvard in 1936 and received a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago in 1940.

6815, Ben & Jerry’s Ice Cream Founders Get Arrested At U.S. Capitol,"The co-founders of Ben & Jerry s Ice Cream, Ben Cohen, and Jerry Greenfield, were two of the 1200+ arrested in the past week at the U.S. Capitol to protest the influence big money has in politics as part of the Democracy Spring movement. According to the U.S. Capitol Police, those arrested were charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding, which is unlawful demonstration activity. Both Cohen and Greenfield were processed and released on scene.Ben Cohen also runs a non-profit, Stamp Stampede, which literally stamps money out of politics. The stamps stamp money with slogans such as  Not to be used for bribing politicians. No matter what issue you are most passionate about environment, healthcare, soaring prescription drug costs the root cause is always linked to corporations giving so-called donations in large sums to politicians, in a process Senator John McCain has called  legalized bribery,  Ben Cohen told me in an interview for the New York Observer in December 2015. A few hundred really wealthy people put in the majority of early contributions to our country s presidential candidates,  he said.  In the context of congress, our representatives get gobs of money from corporations through lobbyists for either passing or not passing legislation, essentially transforming our democracy into an oligarchy. We can t tackle the rest of the problems until we tackle this basic one. It s difficult to address because it requires an amendment to overturn a Supreme Court decision, but that s what Americans have done throughout history we have worked to overturn egregious decisions, which is why we have the constitutional amendment process. The non-profit s website, StampStampede.org, has photos of stamped money posing with Senator Elizabeth Warren and other advocates for getting money out of politics. As long as corporate and wealthy influences can undermine democracy through campaign contributions, the gridlock in congress will persist and most likely worsen. Big money doesn t want meaningful progressive reforms, they want to influence legislation to insulate themselves from the rigors of a competitive market while exploiting tax loopholes and government subsidies to maximize their profits at the expense of the working and middle classes in America.Featured Image Courtesy of Flickr",News,"April 19, 2016"

17719,JUST IN: NYC TERRORIST Allegedly Entered U.S. On NY Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer’s ‘DIVERSITY VISA” Program,"Mark Levin dropped a bombshell on his show tonight about the Muslim terrorist who killed 9 people in Manhattan and injured dozens.  The Diversity VISA program was given the green light by none other than New York Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer... Mark Levin; NYC muslim terrorist came to US under  Diversity VISA Program    a bizarre lottery to shove more foreigners down our throats  Deplorable MD   (@MDDeplorable) October 31, 2017According to ABC 7:Authorities say he came to the United States seven years ago from Uzbekistan under what is called the Diversity Visa Program, which offers a lottery for people from countries with few immigrants in America.DIVERSITY LOTTERYOn May 1, 2017, the Washington Post wrote an article designed to criticize President Trump, as millions were concerned that this could be the last year of the  Diversity Lottery .According to the Washington Post, the lottery s premise is simple. Each year, the Diversity Visa Lottery, as it is officially known, provides up to 50,000 randomly selected foreigners   fewer than 1 percent of those who enter the drawing   with permanent residency in the United States.It s not connected to employment or family members in the United States. The only requirement is that entrants be adults with a high school diploma or two years of work experience. Winners can bring spouses and children. Citizens of countries that have sent 50,000 people to the United States in the past five years   such as Canada, China, India, Nigeria and Mexico   are ineligible to participate.The current lottery coincides with an intense debate over immigration and comes amid policy changes that have made the country less welcoming to new arrivals. President Trump has cracked down on illegal immigration and pressed forward with plans to build a wall along the border with Mexico. He has issued executive orders targeting foreign workers, refugees and travelers from certain majority-Muslim countries.But he hasn t said a word about the green-card lottery.Its days may be numbered, nonetheless. The lottery appears to conflict with the president s call for a  merit-based  immigration system. And at least two bills in the Republican-controlled Congress seek to eliminate the program. The Diversity Lottery is plagued with fraud, advances no economic or humanitarian interest, and does not even deliver the diversity of its namesake,  according to a news release from Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), a co-sponsor of one of the bills.The program   operated from a consular center in Williamsburg, Ky.   has been on the chopping block before. It came under attack in 2002 after an Egyptian terrorist who killed two people in Los Angeles was found to be in the United States through his wife s diversity visa.

3844," Leslie Knope Writes Powerful, Heartbreaking Letter To America That EVERYONE Should Read","Who doesn t love Leslie Knope? She even wormed her way into the heart of that staunch libertarian Ron Swanson.Parks and Recreation has a beloved place in the hearts of many in America, in fact   especially millennials. And no character is more beloved than Amy Poehler s Leslie Knope.For many fans, it s almost impossible to imagine a reaction to this electoral disaster from the almost annoyingly bubbly Knope   her optimism doesn t seem to have much of a place here. However, while perfectly maintaining the voice of the character, she shows that s not the case. You can read my favorite passage below:Like most people, I deal with tragedy by processing the five stages of grief: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, and Acceptance. My denial over the election results was intense. My anger was (in Ron s words)  significant.  My bargaining was short, but creative  I offered my soul and the souls of all of my friends in exchange for 60,000 more votes in Milwaukee, to any demon who cared to accept. (Tom told me it was a terrible deal, but I didn t care, in that moment.) My depression I have already mentioned. Which brings us to Acceptance. And here s what I stand on that:No. I do not accept it.I acknowledge that Donald Trump is the President. I understand, intellectually, that he won the election. But I do not accept that our country has descended into the hatred-swirled slop pile that he lives in. I reject out of hand the notion that we have thrown up our hands and succumbed to racism, xenophobia, misogyny, and crypto-fascism. I do not accept that. I reject that. I fight that. Today, and tomorrow, and every day until the next election, I reject and fight that story. I work hard and I form ideas and I meet and talk to other people who feel like me, and we sit down and drink hot chocolate (I have plenty) and we plan. We plan like mofos. We figure out how to fight back, and do good in this infuriating world that constantly wants to bend toward the bad. And we will be kind to each other, and supportive of each other s ideas, and we will do literally anything but accept this as our fate.And let me say something to the young girls who are reading this. Hi, girls. On behalf of the grown-ups of America who care about you and your futures, I am awfully sorry about how miserably we screwed this up. We elected a giant farting T. rex who does not like you, or care about you, or think about you, unless he is scanning your bodies with his creepy T. rex eyes, or trying to physically grab you like a toy his daddy got him (or would have, if his daddy had loved him). (Sorry, that was a low blow.) (Actually, not sorry, I m pissed, and I m on a roll, so zip it, super-ego!) Our President-Elect is everything you should abhor, and fear, in a male role model. He has spent his life telling you, and girls and women like you, that your lives are valueless except as sexual objects. He has demeaned you, and belittled you, and put you in a little box to be looked at and not heard. It is your job, and the job of girls and women like you, to bust out.I highly encourage you to read the rest of it as well   Leslie is exactly right. It s time for us to fight harder than ever.",News,"November 10, 2016"
6134, Chris Cuomo SLAMS Trump For Promising “A Lot Of Things That Can’t Be Done” In Energy Speech (VIDEO),"Earlier this week, Donald Trump made a speech in Bismarck, North Dakota to talk about his energy policy. While it might have been refreshing for the business mogul to actually talk about a policy instead of attacking his Democratic rivals, saying offensive things about women and minorities or retweeting white supremacists, it s safe to say Trump s supporters should hold off on getting too excited over anything he says   because it s all false promises.During Trump s speech, Trump promised American voters that he would cancel the crucial 2015 Paris agreement that binds all nations to the common goal of tackling climate change, and that he d  rescind  the EPA rules that President Barack Obama set up to decrease emissions from coal-fired power plants. If it sounds improbable, that s because it pretty much is   and no one was faster to point this out that CNN s Chris Cuomo on Friday. In speaking with Trump s campaign senior advisor Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Cuomo criticized the GOP candidate for his sloppy ideas. He said: Donald Trump put out a big speech about his energy policy, about coal, about oil, about regulation. And the criticism of it is that he proposed a lot of things that can t be done. You can t get rid of all of the EPA regulations. You can t just make coal as huge as it once was. There are good and bad reasons for that. Fair criticisms that the proposal can t do what Donald Trump says it will do. Huckabee Sanders argued that the Environmental Protection Agency has to be  reined in and brought back down.  She said: I think there are some big things you can do, and exactly what Donald Trump said is we need to move to an all-of-the-above approach. The Obama administration and his energy policy has been job-killing, [has] raised energy costs across America, has been horrible for our country, so we ve got to go back to where we put all options on the table. Huckabee Sanders continued to diss Obama and added that, We ve got to absolutely reverse what has taken place over the last eight years under the Obama administration by taking away the energy independence that Americans have enjoyed and making us more dependent on foreign energy and go back to where we can energize our own country on our own. Cuomo fired back, stating that the EPA wasn t perfect, just like  every government agency.  He continued: But reducing fossil fuel dependence is a very popular thing in America, and that s a big part of the regulations, and in terms of energy independence, the United States right now puts out 74 percent of its oil needs. I mean, I guess you could go to 100 percent, but the idea that we re somehow, you know, really deficient in terms of how much of our own needs we provide for, it s just not true.  Huckabee Sanders continued to try and counter attack, but Cuomo shut her down every time with realistic scenarios and facts. You can watch Cuomo blast Trump s policies below: Trump s energy policy speech came just a day before Trump told drought-stricken Californians that the extreme water shortage they ve been experiencing doesn t really exist, and offered a conspiracy theory as an alternative explanation. Clearly, Trump isn t someone that we can trust for environmental or energy issues.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"May 28, 2016"
7931, Elijah Cummings Made Sure The GOP Is Well Aware They’re Hypocritical A**holes Regarding Flint,"There seems to be a definite double standard when it comes to how Republicans in Congress want to go about investigating terrible governors. When it came to investigating former Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber (D), Republicans like Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) were fast and furious with their requests to obtain the information they wanted in regards to a scandal surrounding Oregon s health insurance exchange. However, when it comes to going after Republican Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan over the horrendous Flint water crisis, those same Republicans so adamant at going after a Democratic governor, failed to send requests to investigate Flint.Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) is not about to let them get away with this hypocrisy whatsoever.In a letter sent by Cummings to Chaffetz, who is the Chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, Cummings points out the clear double-standard of the committee going after Kitzhaber, but not Snyder in the same regard. And while Cummings does give them some credit for called Snyder before the Committee in March, it is clear that they are not going after Snyder with the same vigor. Cummings wrote: During our meeting last week, you explained that you had spoken directly with Governor Snyder, and you suggested that one reason not to request documents from him is because he might claim that his communications about the Flint water crisis are protected by executive privilege. Although I was not a part of your conversation with Governor Snyder, any claim of executive privilege to withhold documents from Congress would be a surprising turn of events that directly contradicts the Governor s own promises of accountability to the people of Michigan. Cummings also wrote: I believe that the Committee should apply the same standards for requesting documents to all governors, regardless of whether they are Democrats or Republicans. By declining to send any document request at all to Governor Snyder, the Committee is creating the perception of a double-standard in which it has requested documents from a Democratic governor, but not from a Republican governor. He then goes on to give the example of former Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber.It is simply woefully irresponsible to so blatantly neglect going after Gov. Snyder, especially considering the Flint, Michigan water crisis is so irreversibly severe causing lifelong health issues to those affected. Not only should they be investigating Snyder to the fullest extent, but they should be pushing for his resignation, as is what happened with Kitzhaber.Cummings sums it up best when he states: The Committee has never accepted this practice as an adequate standard of investigation, and we should not do so now. Governor Snyder and his staff are central figures in the decision-making process that led to the poisoning of Flint residents, and the Committee owes it to these residents to conduct a comprehensive and bipartisan investigation. Snyder needs to be held responsible and party politics need to be checked at the door. End of story.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 22, 2016"

The vernal pools, temporary bodies of water that house certain species of plants and animals, are protected as waters of the United States by the Clean Water Act of 1972. We expected the Trump administration to provide regulatory relief from Obama-era overreach, and we haven t seen it yet,  Duarte said according to the Record Spotlight.

1201, It’s Mueller Time!: Russia Probe Just Got Worse For Trump And It’s Going To Hurt,"Justice Department deputy solicitor general Michael Dreeben will assist Robert Mueller and he s no slacker. He has argued more than 100 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court so his resume is worthy of joining the investigation into possible coordination between Trump s associates and Russian officials. Donald Trump had better stock up on aspirin because team Mueller is going to be all up in his business. The move signals that Mueller may be seeking advice on complex areas of criminal law, including what constitutes obstruction of justice and that has been an issue of debate for a while now. Most recently, when former FBI Director James Comey testified Thursday.Dreeben is the department s go-to lawyer on criminal justice cases and is highly respected by Democrats and Republicans alike due to his encyclopedic knowledge of criminal law, according to the Washington Post.Dreeben has been pulled into the investigation to work part time for Mueller while he continues to oversee the department s criminal appellate cases, according to Justice officials.According to former and current Justice Department officials, Mueller s recruitment of Dreeben into the probe shows how serious he is about the investigation and signals complexities in the investigation.Dreeben is thought of as brilliant in his area of expertise:Michael is the most brilliant and most knowledgeable federal criminal lawyer in America   period,  said Walter Dellinger, a law professor at Duke University School of Law and acting solicitor general for the 1996-1997 term of the Supreme Court. I learned early on in my time as acting [solicitor general] that there was no point of ever thinking of second-guessing Michael on a matter of federal criminal law because he just knew more than I did or could ever know,  Dellinger said.  He s a straight shooter, and is held in the greatest esteem by the FBI and lawyers in U.S. attorneys offices all over the country. It s not just Dreeben:Mueller s team includes Jeannie Rhee, a former deputy assistant attorney general and a partner in the investigations practice at WilmerHale, and Andrew Weissmann, the chief of the Justice Department s fraud section who oversaw corruption investigations including the probe into cheating by Volkswagen on diesel emissions tests over.Aaaand, Trump s lawyer can t even spell  President  so that s kind of sad, don t you think?

4894, Trump Supporting KKK Leader Defends Trump And Alt-Right In Response To Hillary’s Brilliant Speech,"David Duke is a former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard who also happens to be one of the most famous white supremacists in modern history. He is also, like many white supremacists, anti-semites, and other assorted despicable bigots, a Donald Trump supporter. Today, as we all know by now, Hillary Clinton issued a blistering takedown of Trump in a brilliant speech delivered in Reno, Nevada. She indicted the so-called  alt-right  movement   which is really nothing more than the new white supremacy   as well as Donald Trump himself for being nothing more than bigots, and bringing their bigotry into the mainstream via this presidential election. Well, of course, David Duke was most unhappy with this, and decided to issue a statement defending the alt-right   which of course means, at this point, that he is also defending Trump.Duke talked to Buzzfeed s Andrew Kaczynski and said:Kaczynski went on to tweet:Bottom line, the white nationalists trust Trump and don't find his condemnations of them to be sincere.  andrew kaczynski (@BuzzFeedAndrew) August 26, 2016He s right, of course. They know that Trump is just doing what he has to do to get elected. He is their guy. They know that all of his pathetic and disingenuous attempts to reach out to communities of color is really just lip service; hell, he isn t even actually talking to communities of color. He s trying to assure more mainstream white people that he isn t quite as racist as they thought, and that they should still vote for him, because he s still their man.Trump s campaign has completely embraced the lunatic fringe, and they are welcoming him with open arms. No matter how much his campaign staff tries to  soften  his bombastic tone and gets him to read off of a teleprompter, the truth is already out there, via not just Trump s own words, associations, and actions, but also via the full throated endorsement and defense of Klan leaders and other white supremacist leaders like David Duke.GOP, if you ve any sense at all, you ll kick ALL of these racists out of your party.

22152,Elite Nazi-allied Order From Hungary Claims Trump Adviser Sebastian Gorka Is Sworn Member,"Lili Bayer and Larry Cohler-Esses HaaretzSebastian Gorka, President Trump s top counter-terrorism adviser, is a formal member of a Hungarian far-right group that is listed by the U.S. State Department as having been  under the direction of the Nazi Government of Germany  during World War II, leaders of the organization have told the Forward.The elite order, known as the Vit zi Rend, was established as a loyalist group by Admiral Miklos Horthy, who ruled Hungary as a staunch nationalist from 1920 to October 1944. A self-confessed anti-Semite, Horthy imposed restrictive Jewish laws prior to World War II and collaborated with Hitler during the conflict. His cooperation with the Nazi regime included the deportation of hundreds of thousands of Jews into Nazi hands. STRANGE CHARACTER: People are now questioning why Trump hired bizarre Hungarian author as his  terrorism  expert.Gorka s membership in the organization   if these Vit zi Rend leaders are correct, and if Gorka did not disclose this when he entered the United States as an immigrant   could have implications for his immigration status. The State Department s Foreign Affairs Manual specifies that members of the Vit zi Rend  are presumed to be inadmissible  to the country under the Immigration and Nationality Act.Gorka   who Vit zi Rend leaders say took a lifelong oath of loyalty to their group   did not respond to multiple emails sent to his work and personal accounts, asking whether he is a member of the Vit zi Rend and, if so, whether he disclosed this on his immigration application and on his application to be naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 2012.

696," Trump Put Himself In Deep Sh*t, Personally Drafted Statement Lying About Jr’s Russia Meeting","Donald Trump and all of the people around him have a serious problem with the truth. That problem is giving them serious legal problems that do not have to be when it comes to Special Counsel Robert Mueller s investigation into the Trump campaign s possible collusion with the Russians to try and fix the 2016 election.First, they said there were not meetings with Russians. Then, we find out that Donald Trump Jr., former Trump Campaign Manager Paul Manafort, and Trump s son-in-law Jared Kushner met with a shady Russian lawyer, along with other people tied to the Russian government. After that, Trump Jr. came out with a statement saying that they were talking about Russian adoptions and nothing else. Then, that statement fell apart when it turns out that they went into that meeting thinking they were going to get dirt on then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. Now, it turns out that while the lawyers wanted to be truthful in Trump Jr. s statement, Donald Trump decided he wanted to lie for his son, and personally put together the statement.Trump s advisers are furious. One said, on condition of anonymity, to the Washington Post: This was . . . unnecessary. Now someone can claim he s the one who attempted to mislead. Somebody can argue the president is saying he doesn t want you to say the whole truth. The adviser then went on to suggest that Trump doesn t fully understand that he and his people are in serious legal trouble over the Russia investigation: He refuses to sit still. He doesn t think he s in any legal jeopardy, so he really views this as a political problem he is going to solve by himself. A lawyer who investigated President George W. Bush regarding the unmasking of CIA Agent Valerie Plame, Peter Zeidenberg, says of the bumbling attempt at a cover-up by Team Trump: The thing that really strikes me about this is the stupidity of involving the president. They are still treating this like a family-run business and they have a PR problem. . . . What they don t seem to understand is this is a criminal investigation involving all of them. Well, hopefully, they continue to screw up in their responses to this. There s definitely wrongdoing here. Perhaps Robert Mueller already has the smoking gun, and wants to make sure the case is airtight before they are all indicted and hauled off to jail where belong. In the meantime, the entire administration is dangerous and should be removed.

17220,THINK AMERICA CAN’T END UP LIKE GREECE? THINK AGAIN!," The United States government has been living beyond its means, running up an enormous debt that will eventually need to be repaid. Most Americans look at the rerun of the Greek euro crisis with something between smug amusement and condescending disapproval. When will those profligate Greeks get their economic house in order and stop looking to others to bail them out? But, should people living in glass economic houses really throw stones? After all, just like Greece, the United States government has been living beyond its means, running up an enormous debt that will eventually need to be repaid. True, our budget deficit this year will be lower than it has been, just $486 billion compared to $1.4 trillion as recently as 2009. But this is just a temporary respite. Within the next couple of years the deficit will start to rise again. By 2025, we will again face trillion-dollar shortfalls. And even a $486 billion deficit adds to our ever growing debt. Our national debt currently approaches $18.2 trillion, roughly 101% of GDP. That s right. We owe more than the value of all the goods and services produced in this country every year. It is as if your credit-card bills exceeded your entire pay check. That s not quite as bad as Greece, of course, whose debt exceeds 177% of their GDP. But it is worse than countries like France or Spain.  And give us time! Like Greece, the driving force behind our debt is the growing cost of entitlement programs for health care and retirement. If one includes future unfunded liabilities for Social Security and Medicare, our real debt exceeds $90 trillion. That s more than five times our GDP. Greece is still in worse shape   their unfunded liabilities top 875% of GDP   but we re gaining. At the heart of Greece s problems lies a government grown too big, too intrusive, and too expensive. The Greek government spent nearly half of the country s GDP last year (49.3%), and that actually represents a decline from the 51.8% it averaged since 2006. The Greek s may complain about austerity, but they ve hardly practiced it. Our government is far smaller than Greece s today. Federal spending is just 20.5% of GDP. But, according to the Congressional Budget Office s alternative fiscal scenario, that could rise to almost 34% by mid-century. Factoring in state and local government spending, which already accounts for roughly 14.4% of GDP, total government expenditure in the US could reach 48% to 50% in 2050, roughly Greek levels. As government grows, the private sector contracts. Greece has one of the most inhospitable business climates in Europe, ranking 84th in the world in the most recent Economic Freedom of the World Index. Meanwhile, as the United States continues to increase taxes and regulations, we have fallen from the second highest economic freedom ranking just 15 years ago to 12th place. Of course, the United States has some advantages that the Greeks lack. Greece owes a significant share of its debt to foreign governments, while the majority of American debt is domestically held. The United States also faces low borrowing rates, while Greece has been effectively shut out of capital markets. The US debt may be bad, but in many ways we are the fastest horse in the glue factory. As long as the euro remains in crisis, we will continue to be able to borrow money at absurdly low interest rates. The United States also controls its own currency and monetary policy, while Greece is hostage to the European Central Bank, which must balance its interest against those of other countries in the monetary union, many of which are in far different economic positions.The danger for the United States is that spending on entitlements will surge in the coming decades, which means that, absent reform, they take over the economy. Investors would respond to the weaker economic outlook by demanding higher returns in order to continue investing in US bonds, which would further drive up interest costs, making our problems even worse. And, of course, unlike Greece, there aren t other countries or organizations available to bail us out.Read more: NYP",Government News,"Jul 6, 2015"

6586, Cruz Trying To Hold Fiorina’s Hand Is More Awkward Than A Middle School Dance (VIDEO),"When Ted Cruz announced Carly Fiorina as his running mate last week, it left many, many people scratching their heads. It d be like a football team getting their finger sizes measured for Super Bowl rings after they ve already been eliminated from making the playoffs. It just didn t make any sense whatsoever. It was clearly a move to try to get media attention (which worked) and in hopes of helping him win the Republican nomination (which it won t).Add to this how awkward of a pairing Cruz and Fiorina make. They go together like orange juice and toothpaste, where the only thing left will be the bitter taste left in everyone s mouths after witnessing their desperation.If you don t believe how awkward they are together, then by all means, witness it for yourselves.Here s Cruz trying to grab Fiorina s hand in the typical politician power pose with their running mate.

1147," BREAKING: Shooter Targets Congressional Republicans At Baseball Practice, Steve Scalise Shot","As the divisions in the nation bubble over, it seems that one person has snapped, and done the unthinkable: opened fire on a baseball practice full of Congressional Republicans in Alexandria, Virginia. Reports are steadily coming in, and it has been confirmed that House Majority Whip Steve Scalise has been shot. He is currently en route to a nearby hospital and is said to be in stable condition. There are also reports that Capitol Hill police officers and possibly Congressional aides have been injured as well. There is currently no reporting available on their condition. Reports suggest that the shooter was either taken down by Capitol Hill police or taken into custody.The really sad thing about this incident is that this practice was in preparation for a bipartisan baseball game that is supposed to promote unity between the two parties. Further, things would have been much worse if Rep. Scalise had not been there because Capitol Police would not have been present without a member of leadership in attendance.This is seriously the work of someone truly sick. No one should be killing anyone, for any reason, but certainly, this targeting of lawmakers at a baseball practice that was designed to help the nation take a break from ugly partisan politics is truly beyond the pale. Political violence is never acceptable, period.If this isn t proof that we really need to turn down the temperature when it comes to the rhetoric and divisions in this nation posthaste, I don t know what is.This is a developing story.

19985,ANTI-GUN Zealot KATIE COURIC Hit With $12 MILLION Defamation Lawsuit By 2nd Amendment Group [VIDEO]," Little Miss Sunshine  has fooled a lot of people over the years into believing her she was just some innocuous, peppy little host with everyone s best intentions as her primary concern. Unfortunately, Katie Couric may have just ironically  shot herself in the foot  when she and her director Stephanie Soechtig edited their anti-gun documentary Under the Gun in order to make a gun rights group in Virginia look as if they couldn t answer a simple question.Here s Rush Limbaugh explaining how Katie Couric deceived her viewers with her anti-gun  documentary : They re now facing a $12 million defamation lawsuit, according to documents provided to Bearing Arms.Second Amendment rights advocacy organization the Virginia Citizens Defense League (VCDL), along with two of its members, today filed a $12 million defamation lawsuit against Katie Couric, director Stephanie Soechtig, Atlas Films, and Studio 3 Partners LLC d/b/a Epix for false and defamatory footage featured in the 2016 documentary film Under the Gun. The film portrays a fictional exchange in which members of the VCDL appear silent, stumped, and avoiding eye contact for nearly nine seconds after Katie Couric asks a question about background checks. An unedited audio recording of the interview reveals that contrary to the portrayal in the film the VCDL members had immediately begun responding to Couric s question.In the filing, the VCDL, Daniel L. Hawes, Esq., and Patricia Webb allege that the filmmakers knowingly and maliciously manufactured the fictional exchange by splicing in footage that the filmmakers took surreptitiously after telling the interviewees to be silent for ten seconds so that recording equipment could be calibrated. The filing also contains side-by-side screenshots of the film s footage of the VCDL members and anti-gun advocates, alleging that the filmmakers manipulated lighting to cast shadows on the VCDL members and to make them appear sinister and untrustworthy.  We were horrified to see how Couric and her team manipulated us and the video footage to make us look like fools who didn t stand up for the Second Amendment,  said Mr. Philip Van Cleave, President of the VCDL.  We want to set the record straight and hold them accountable for what they ve done. You shouldn t intentionally misrepresent someone s views just because you disagree with them. The lawsuit, filed in federal court (United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia  Richmond Division), seeks $12 million in compensatory damages, plus punitive damages. The VCDL, Mr. Hawes, and Ms. Webb are represented by Tom Clare, Libby Locke, and Megan Meier of Clare Locke LLP, a boutique law firm specializing in defamation litigation. The fraud committed by Couric and Soechtig should be a career ender for both women, who have been unashamed of their behavior.What is not yet known is if Couric, Soetchtig, and one of their producers will face federal gun crimes criminal charges for obvious felonies they committed in Arizona while making the anti-gun film. Soechtig has now twice confessed (on video and in writing) to committing federal felony crimes that should lead to criminal charges against at least her and the Colorado producer (believed to be Kanau), along with any other Under the Gun staff/producers who took part in the conspiracy to make these clearly illegal interstate sales.ATF Phoenix Special Agent in Charge (SAC) Thomas Atteberry and Assistant Special Agent in Charge (ASAC) Mickey D. Leadingham have little recourse other than to start an investigation into the confessed crimes.You can read the defamation case against Couric here (PDF).Among other things, the complaint alleges that,  The Defendants manipulated the footage in service of an agenda: they wanted to establish that there is no basis for opposing universal background checks by fooling viewers into believing that even a panel of pro-Second Amendment advocates could not provide one. The Defendants intentionally disregarded the truth of the actual exchange that had taken place and took at least six intentional steps to manufacture a fictional exchange to support their agenda. In addition to editing footage of VCDL members, the suit alleges that Soechtig s film crew used lighting tricks to make VCDL members look shadowed and sinister, while favoring gun control supporters with much more flattering lighting.For entire story: Bearing ArmsHere is a clip showing how Katie Couric edited  Under the Gun  to make gun owners look like they don t have an answer to what she has framed as an  unanswerable  question: ",left-news,"Sep 13, 2016"
2516," WATCH: Morning Joe Host Tells Kellyanne Conway To Go F*ck Herself, BANS Her From Show","Kellyanne Conway is definitely going to whine about this.CNN may have reversed their ban on Kellyanne Conway, but if Mika Brzezinski has her way, she won t ever be able to spread her lies on Morning Joe again.In the latest backlash against Donald Trump, the Morning Joe host declared that Kellyanne Conway will not be booked on the MSNBC program ever again because or her constant lies in defense of her tyrannical boss. I know for a fact she tries to book herself on this show,  Brzezinski said on the air.  I won t do it. I don t believe in fake news or information that is not true. That is   every time I ve ever seen her on television something is askew, off, or incorrect. Indeed, Kellyanne Conway lies so much on every media outlet she appears on it s a wonder her nose hasn t grown like Pinocchio s.Ever since she joined Trump s campaign she has been whining about how the media covers Trump and has insisted that her lies are the truth. Fact-checkers have had to work overtime to make sure the American people know that she is lying.Joe Scarborough opined that Conway lies because she isn t as close with Trump as shes says she is. She s just saying things just to get in front of the TV to prove her relevance because behind the scenes she s not in these meetings and any reporter can ask anybody in that White House and they will say the same thing. She s not in these meetings. So why does the president allow her to keep going out and spreading false information? Apparently, Trump is hoping that if Kellyanne Conway keeping repeating the lies that Americans will accept them as the truth.But Mika Brzezinski refuses to take part in that effort, so she made it very clear that Conway will not be invited on to Morning Joe as long as she is hosting. Kellyanne Conway does not need to text our show, as long as I m on it,  Brzezinski said.  It s not happening here. Here s the video via YouTube.Conway has been an embarrassment since day one. Her most recent embarrassments include peddling Ivanka Trump s product line in violation of federal ethics rules and making up a terrorist attack in Bowling Green, Kentucky in defense of Trump s travel ban. Beyond that, she fumbles so much that we ve lost count.The media should ban Conway from appearing on all shows across the board. All she does is spread propaganda and false information, and if Scarborough is right that she really doesn t know what s going on inside the White House then she shouldn t be considered a source worthy of interviewing.Featured image via screenshot",News,"February 15, 2017"

KARMABill Clinton was heckled by kids for taking too long between shots at his golf-filled 69th birthday.The ex-president, who has started his two-week vacation in the Hamptons without wife Hillary, who s on the campaign trail, sported neon pink sneakers and a matching hat at Montauk Downs State Park golf course Tuesday. He also played a round of mini-golf at Puff  n  Putt with his niece and nephew, who looked around 8 and 10.Although they had  a lot of Secret Service  in tow, Clinton took the time to talk to a vet and his children, ages 4, 9 and 11.

503," Paul Ryan Sharpens His Backstabbing Knife, Prepares War With White House (VIDEO)","During Donald Trump s meltdown during his rally in Phoenix Tuesday evening, he threatened to shut down the government unless Congress funds his border wall. The former reality show star launched a rant which was so insane that people are starting to question whether he s fit to hold office. We re pretty sure that House Speaker Paul Ryan is wondering that, too, after Trump s screamy-ragey speech.On Wednesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) said he doesn t  think a government shutdown is necessary,  however, we ve noticed that when the Republican leader says something in stark contrast to Trump s rhetoric, he never says it to his face. Like, for example, when he tweeted his denouncement of the Nazis who marched in Trump s name in Charlottesville, Virginia, with one of them murdering Heather Heyer, 32, and injuring 19 others, he failed to tag @RealDonaldTrump.But anyway, Ryan said during a press conference in Hillsboro, Oregon,  I don t think a government shutdown is necessary, and I don t think most people want to see a government shutdown, ourselves included. Ryan continued to say that  Congress in the House has already done its work on this issue  and left it up to the Senate. Given the time of year it is, and the rest of the appropriations we have to do, we re going to need more time to complete our appropriations process, particularly in the Senate,  he said.Talking Points Memo reports:Trump on Tuesday night suggested he would push to tie funding for his proposed border wall to a government spending bill Congress must pass in the fall to avert a shutdown. I don t think anyone s interested in having a shutdown. I don t think it s in our interest to do so,  Ryan added.  I don t think you have to choose between the two.

On the other hand, Trump doesn t seem to care about very much. Ryan is trying to distance himself from the very president he supports. He s playing it safe, knowing full well that Trump won t last much longer in office. Ryan wants to come out of the madness with his hands clean so he can say,  Hey, I called Trump out  without actually calling him out. That said, he s going to have a battle on his hands to keep the government open and it looks like he s ready for that. We re certain several of his Republican colleagues would back him up on that.Image via screen capture. ",News,"August 23, 2017"

The powers-that-be at the intelligence agencies didn t follow the proper channels before opening up spying on the Trump campaign! They needed proof that the Trump dossier is authentic but never received that proof. They moved forward with the spying anyway! What dirty rats these Democrats are!FBI and Justice Department officials have told congressional investigators in recent days that they have not been able to verify or corroborate the substantive allegations of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign outlined in the Trump dossier.The FBI received the first installment of the dossier in July 2016. It received later installments as they were written at the height of the presidential campaign, which means the bureau has had more than a year to investigate the allegations in the document.The dossier was financed by the Hillary Clinton campaign and compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.An August 24, 2017 subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee to the FBI and Justice Department asked for information on the bureau s efforts to validate the dossier. Specifically, the subpoena demanded  any documents, if they exist, that memorialize DOJ and/or FBI efforts to corroborate, validate, or evaluate information provided by Mr. Steele and/or sub-sources and/or contained in the  Trump Dossier. According to sources familiar with the matter, neither the FBI nor the Justice Department has provided documents in response to that part of the committee s subpoena. But in face-to-face briefings with congressional staff, according to those sources, FBI and DOJ officials have said they cannot verify the dossier s charges of a conspiracy between the Russian government and the Trump campaign.Read more: WE",politics,"Nov 20, 2017"
4618, Heckler Screams ‘F*ck Hillary’ At Clinton Rally – And She Just Laughs At Him (VIDEO),"Sometimes you ve got to laugh   especially if you re the Democratic nominee, who is currently facing down a level of unbridled hatred that rivals all previous presidential candidates with the exception of Barack Obama. Recently, Hillary contracted pneumonia   or, if you listen to our friends on the Right, she s on her deathbed and completely unfit to serve as President because reasons. The downright comical reaction to this, coupled with the numerous right-wing anti-Hillary witch hunts like Benghazi and the manufactured controversy over her emails, is enough to give one a chuckle   but it s even more fun when one of the ignoramuses who subscribe to such ridiculous notions stops by one of her rallies to tell the Democratic nominee how he really feels about her.As Hillary spoke to a crowd in Greensboro, North Carolina, a heckler screamed: F*ck Hillary. Hillary s reaction was priceless. As the crowd cheered for her and  Hillary  chants broke out, a grin formed on the face of the former Secretary of State, quickly turning into a chuckle then a full-blown laugh.

The American side, which leads the coalition that Turkey belongs to, knew about the location and time of our planes  flights, and we were hit exactly there and at that time,  Putin said at a joint press conference with French counterpart Francois Hollande in the Kremlin. Putin said the Russians had given prior information to the U.S. of the flight path of the plane   but the U.S. had  leaked  the information to Turkey.Ahead of the Hollande talks, Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan traded barbs, with the Russian leader saying he was waiting for an apology and Erdogan ruling out any such move.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says Turkey s right to protect its borders must be respected, after the military shot down a Russian plane on the Syrian border for allegedly violating its airspace.Putin on Thursday dismissed as  rubbish  Turkey s claim that it would not have shot down the jet if it had known it was Russian. They [our planes] have identification signs and these are well visible,  Putin said.  Instead of [ ] ensuring this never happens again, we are hearing unintelligible explanations and statements that there is nothing to apologise about. Putin has also accused Turkey of buying oil from the Islamic State jihadist group, whose financing heavily relies on the sale of energy resources.Putin said there was  no doubt  that oil from  terrorist-controlled  territory in Syria was making its way across the border into Turkey. We see from the sky where these vehicles [carrying oil] are going,  Putin said.  They are going to Turkey day and night.

5394," Christie Goes Ballistic On Cruz For ‘Awful, Selfish Speech’","Chris Christie went ballistic on Ted Cruz Wednesday night following the Texas senator s failure to endorse Donald Trump during his speech at the Republican National Convention. It was an awful, selfish speech by someone who tonight, through the words he said on that stage, showed everybody why he has richly earned the reputation that he has on Capitol Hill,  Christie declared angrily.The New Jersey governor wasn t the only one who was less than pleased with Cruz and his refusal to endorse Trump, who has now officially secured the Republican nomination. During Cruz s speech, the crowd chanted  Endorse Trump, Endorse Trump!  and then erupted in a chorus of boos when that endorsement never came. If you love our country and love your children as much as I know that you do, stand and speak and vote your conscience,  Cruz said during his prime-time speech at the RNC on Wednesday night.  Vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the Constitution. Christie slammed Cruz for his dramatic words: I don t understand how someone can present themselves as a person of integrity and then come into this room tonight and give that cute speech. And that was cute. Speaking with CNN, Christie said spoke of the crowds reaction to Cruz s steadfast refusal to throw his support behind Trump. The crowd was waiting for him to do the right thing,  the governor said of Cruz.  I think the performance you saw there is why Ted has so richly deserved the reputation he s developed. Cruz isn t the only former Republican presidential hopeful that has chosen not to endorse Trump, even though they signed the pledge saying they would support whoever ended up winning the nomination. Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, and John Kasich have also refused to back The Donald. But Christie pointed out that they are not in the room tonight.

She is revolutionary. Not radical, but revolutionary: The distinction is crucial. She is one of America s greatest modern creations. Her decades in our public life must not blind us to the fact that she represents new realities and possibilities. Indeed, those same decades have conferred upon her what newness usually lacks: judgment, and even wisdom. Oops wrong picture! It matters, of course, that Hillary is a woman. But what matters more is what kind of woman she is. Mrs Clinton announced her intention to seek the Democratic nomination on Sunday   and set upon the campaign trail with a trip to meet  ordinary  voters in Iowa.But she was blasted for her  staged  visit on Tuesday morning to a coffee shop in LeClaire, Iowa.Austin Bird, one of the men pictured sitting at the table with Mrs Clinton, claimed the whole event was orchestrated  from beginning to end .Bird told Daily Mail Online that campaign staffer Troy Price called and asked him and two other young people to meet him Tuesday morning at a restaurant in Davenport, a nearby city. Price then drove them to the coffee house to meet Clinton after vetting them for about a half-hour.The three got the lion s share of Mrs. Clinton s time and participated in what breathless news reports described as a  roundtable  the first of many in her brief Iowa campaign swing. Bird himself is a frequent participant in Iowa Democratic Party events. He interned with President Obama s 2012 presidential re-election campaign, and was tapped to chauffeur Vice President Joe Biden in October 2014 when he visited Davenport. What happened is, we were just asked to be there by Troy,  Bird said Wednesday in a phone interview. We were asked to come to a meeting with Troy, the three of us, at the Village Inn. The other two, he confirmed, were University of Iowa College Democrats president Carter Bell and Planned Parenthood of the Heartland employee Sara Sedlacek. It was supposed to be a strategy meeting,  Bird recalled,  to get our thoughts about issues. But then all of a sudden he says,  Hey, we have Secretary Clinton coming in, would you like to go meet her? And then we got in a car   Troy s car   and we went up to the coffee house, and we sat at a table and then Hillary just came up and talked with us. Bird said  we all were called.

1063, Dem Challenger To Paul Ryan Has Raised A Massive Amount Of Money In The Last 24 hours,"Randy Bryce, known as @IronStache on Twitter, launched a campaign to oust Paul Ryan from Wisconsin s 1st District. Bryce is a union ironworker who has been campaigning for all of one day, and he s already raised $100,000. That is a lot for a new face who s a Democrat living in Republican-land and running in a district that s gone to Paul Ryan every two years since 1999.Bryce isn t just a union ironworker in Republican-land, Wisconsin, though. He s an Army veteran who enlisted right after high school, and then worked his way up to being an ironworker through apprenticeship. His mother suffers from multiple sclerosis, his father is in an assisted living facility, and Randy himself is a cancer survivor. He s campaigning primarily on healthcare right now, and he says on his website: What Paul Ryan and the Republicans are doing to take health care away from millions of us, to make it cost more and cover less, and to allow the protections we ve gained to be stripped away   it s just unacceptable. Bryce has an uphill battle to fight. Ryan is very well-connected both in the 1st District and across America. However, Bryce will work to tie Ryan to Donald Trump as much as possible, working off Democrats  hopes that the Trump effect will help flip Congress next year.But it may not be that terrible a climg. Paul Ryan is already wildly unpopular around the country, with an approval rating below 30 percent. That could very well pull down his popularity in his own district. He s also starting to get a reputation for making every excuse in the book for Trump. Regarding obstruction of justice, Ryan lamely claimed that Trump is new and doesn t know what s appropriate and what s not when it comes to interacting with various agency heads, particularly those in the law enforcement and intelligence communities. Ryan gave him a pass as though he s a little child navigating his way through the world for the first time.He s also confident that Trump will approve of the massively unpopular GOP healthcare bill whatever form that ends up taking and once again blasted the ACA while claiming that their bill is ever so much better.Ryan is almost inextricably linked to Trump right now, and as Trump s base shrinks, so will Ryan s. What Bryce is doing and clearly, what many are hoping he can do is taking advantage of the possibility that a hole will open up in the 1st District because of Trump.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"June 21, 2017"

Tillerson had to leave his position with the company in order to go through the Senate confirmation process for the post.During his confirmation hearing, Tillerson said,  I have never lobbied against [Russian] sanctions personally,  Tillerson said.

22894,DISMISSED: Trump Fires Scandal Plagued FBI Director James Comey – What Does It Mean?,"21st Century WireUS President Donald Trump has accepted a recommendation to  dismiss  FBI director James Comey. Was this a reprisal for the suddenly widened Russia-gate probe into the White House or was there something else at play within the operations of the deep state?Comey was at the center of a political controversy over much of the last year during the US presidential election cycle in 2016, and well into 2017. Throughout 2016, the former FBI director opened, closed and reopened (only to close again) a probe into Hillary Clinton, her email server and looking into accusations leveled at the Clinton Foundation, while also entertaining a dubious Russian probe into the Trump administration alleged  connections to Russia  that helped mine various stories, including a so-called  dossier  regarding the newly elected president in early 2017.In recent years, there have been many highly questionable actions under Comey s leadership at the FBI, such as the Orlando nightclub shooting incident   who s main suspect was previously interviewed by the FBI, as well as a highly questionable  ISIS inspired  shooting event in Garland, Texas linked to an FBI informant case run out of Phoenix, Arizona, and the federal agency s dramatic encroachment on public privacy following a suspicious San Bernardino mass shooting.  These are only just a few examples Grabien News highlights a list of scandals that were either attached to Comey or perpetuated under his watch: Here are 10 of Comey s biggest embarrassments at the FBI:1. Before he bombed the Boston Marathon, the FBI interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev but let him go. Russia sent the Obama Administration a second warning, but the FBI opted against investigating him again.2. Shortly after the NSA scandal exploded in 2013, the FBI was exposed conducting its own data mining on innocent Americans; the agency, Bloomberg reported, retains that material for decades (even if no wrongdoing is found).3. The FBI had possession of emails sent by Nidal Hasan saying he wanted to kill his fellow soldiers to protect the Taliban   but didn t intervene, leading many critics to argue the tragedy that resulted in the death of 31 Americans at Fort Hood could have been prevented. 4. During the Obama Administration, the FBI claimed that two private jets were being used primarily for counterterrorism, when in fact they were mostly being used for Eric Holder and Robert Mueller s business and personal travel. 5. When the FBI demanded Apple create a  backdoor  that would allow law enforcement agencies to unlock the cell phones of various suspects, the company refused, sparking a battle between the feds and America s biggest tech company. What makes this incident indicative of Comey s questionable management of the agency is that a) The FBI jumped the gun, as they were indeed ultimately able to crack the San Bernardino terrorist s phone, and b) Almost every other major national security figure sided with Apple (from former CIA Director General Petraeus to former CIA Director James Woolsey to former director of the NSA, General Michael Hayden), warning that such a  crack  would inevitably wind up in the wrong hands.6. In 2015, the FBI conducted a controversial raid on a Texas political meeting, finger printing, photographing, and seizing phones from attendees (some in the group believe in restoring Texas as an independent constitutional republic).7. During its investigation into Hillary Clinton s mishandling of classified material, the FBI made an unusual deal in which Clinton aides were both given immunity and allowed to destroy their laptops. 8. The father of the radical Islamist who detonated a backpack bomb in New York City in 2016 alerted the FBI to his son s radicalization. The FBI, however, cleared Ahmad Khan Rahami after a brief interview. 9. The FBI also investigated the terrorist who killed 49 people and wounded 53 more at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Fla. Despite a more than 10-month investigation of Omar Mateen   during which Mateen admitting lying to agents   the FBI opted against pressing further and closed its case. 10. CBS recently reported that when two terrorists sought to kill Americans attending the  Draw Muhammad  event in Garland, Texas, the FBI not only had an understanding an attack was coming, but actually had an undercover agent traveling with the Islamists, Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi. The FBI has refused to comment on why the agent on the scene did not intervene during the attack. It s important to remember that Comey is not the only FBI director who bears responsibility for the controversial aspects of 2013 s Boston Bombing. Under FBI director Robert Mueller  Tamerlan Tsarnaev came to the attention of the FBI on at least two occasions  prior to allegedly being involved in what many researchers have described as a false flag terror event in Boston. A questionable event that has arguably been used as a pretext to further clamp down on individual rights in the US.We should also be reminded that the FBI has been routinely caught foiling their very own terror plots  over the past several years.In recent years, the investigative tactics of various intelligence agencies have come into question, none perhaps more dubious then the Newburgh FBI sting that involved entrapping four men to participate in a fabricated event created by the bureau. Here s a 2011 passage from The Guardian describing how an FBI informant named Shahed Hussain coerced four others into a fake terror plot: The  Newburgh Four  now languish in jail. Hussain does not. For Hussain was a fake. In fact, Hussain worked for the FBI as an informant trawling mosques in hope of picking up radicals.Yet far from being active militants, the four men he attracted were impoverished individuals struggling with Newburgh s grim epidemic of crack, drug crime and poverty. One had mental issues so severe his apartment contained bottles of his own urine. He also believed Florida was a foreign country.Hussain offered the men huge financial inducements to carry out the plot   including $250,000 to one man   and free holidays and expensive cars.As defence lawyers poured through the evidence, the Newburgh Four came to represent the most extreme form of a controversial FBI policy to use invented terrorist plots to lure targets.  There has been no case as egregious as this. It is unique in the incentive the government provided. A quarter million dollars?  said Professor Karen Greenberg, a terrorism expert at Fordham University. The reputation of the FBI has suffered greatly in the recent past as well as over the past couple of decades. Incidentally, the FBI is on record as  handling Emad A. Salem, a former Egyptian army officer who was a prized undercover operative thrust into confidential informant status and person who played a key role in the 1993 WTC bombing.All of this has happened under the watchful eye of the FBI   SWORN-IN    FBI director James Comey sworn in by former DOJ head Eric Holder. (Image Source: thewhitehousespin)Over last summer, 21WIRE observed some curious connections between the Clinton Foundation and FBI director James Comey, as well as his questionable handling of other cases related to the Clinton family. Here s the following passage to consider in light of the new information related to the Clinton investigation: Many will also be unaware that before Comey was installed by the Obama Administration as FBI Director, he was on the board of Director at HSBC Bank   a bank implicated in international money laundering, including the laundering of billions on behalf of international drugs and narcotics trafficking cartels.Forbes also points out where Comey was also at the key choke-point during the case involving dodgy auditor KPMG which followed on by the HSBC criminal case: If Comey, and his boss Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez, had made a different decision about KPMG back in 2005, KPMG would not have been around to miss all the illegal acts HSBC and Standard Chartered SCBFF +% were committing on its watch. Bloomberg reported in 2007 that back in June of 2005, Comey was the man thrust into the position of deciding whether KPMG would live or die for its criminal tax shelter violations. Is this just a surface effort by the White House to clean the slate for an agency perpetually embroiled in controversy?More from RT below Trump fires FBI Director James ComeyRT The FBI is one of our Nation s most cherished and respected institutions and today will mark a new beginning for our crown jewel of law enforcement,  said President Trump. While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau,  Trump told Comey in a letter.The letter announcing the termination was hand-delivered to FBI headquarters by Keith Schiller, a Trump security aide, according to several reports citing a White House official.A search for a new permanent FBI Director will begin immediately.The firing of Comey comes days after he testified to Congress on investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 US election.RT continues here READ MORE FBI NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire FBI Files",Middle-east,"May 10, 2017"

1530," Trump Explains Why He Fired James Comey, F*cks Up And Admits He Should Be Impeached (VIDEO)","After kicking the morning off with a tweet storm attacking Democrats for criticizing his choice to fire FBI Director James Comey, Trump only seemed to make matters worse as the day went on.While meeting with pool reporters in the White House, Trump gave a public explanation for the termination of Comey, and accidentally made himself look horrible in the process. Keeping his message short and sweet, Trump said that the reason he fired Comey was because: He wasn t doing a good job, very simply. He was not doing a good job. You can watch that baffling moment below, where Trump cluelessly insults himself and ignored every question about Russia before kicking all the reporters out:That s certainly a strange thing for Trump to say, because by now he must know that his own approval rating is historically low and it continues to plummet with every failure his administration suffers. If Trump agrees that an FBI Director can be fired for their poor performance, it only makes sense that the same should apply to Trump.There s overwhelming evidence that Trump s job performance sucks   and it s not just his disastrous approval rating or the fact that polls show that most Americans want him out. From Trump s failed Muslim travel ban to his disgusting American Health Care Act (Trumpcare), Trump s first 100 days have been filled with failure after failure. There have been several times where Trump had to resort to taking credit for former President Barack Obama s work just to save his image.America is so much worse off now that Trump is in the White House, and if the country has to suffer through the rest of his term, the damage may be irreversible by the time we get a more qualified POTUS. But today, Trump accidentally said those magic words: if Comey can be fired for doing a bad job, so should he.Featured image via Pool / Getty Images",News,"May 10, 2017"
971, This Really Happened: Fox Interrupted Trump To Criticize Him And Praised Obama,"If today on Fox News was any indication at all, Donald Trump may have finally gone too far, even for some of his base, when he tweeted this Thursday morning about Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski:I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don t watch anymore).

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 29, 2017While his spokespeople have been working overtime defending the indefensible and sexist tweets, even Fox News thought it was over the top and even Fox News is beginning to see how much better we had it under President Obama.Scarborough and Brzezinski s network, MSNBC, along with CNN, was airing live remarks by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin during a White House press briefing, but Fox uncharacteristically broke away to talk instead about the tweets with Republican National Committee chair Ronna Romney McDaniel:McDaniel defended the president, arguing that his tweets were a natural response to the constant criticism he receives from Brzezinski and co-host Joe Scarborough. Today, the president acted like a human, and he pushed back,  she said.Fox News anchor Julie Banderas wasn t buying the excuse. Listen,  she replied,  you don t need to stoop to the level, obviously. I don t care who you are. You don t stoop to the level of that. I mean that s like me scolding my 4-year-old for using a bad word and then me repeating it. That s just not how you run a country or you parent a 4-year-old. I mean I have to be honest, you know, if you see this negative commentary on a show, change the channel. Ignore it.

3799," According To The New White House Chief Strategist, Liberal Women Are Just ‘A Bunch Of Dykes’","During an interview, Steve Bannon  who is the new White House strategist under Donald Trump  just referred to left-wing women as  a bunch of dykes .Steve Bannon was recently appointed as a senior adviser for Trump, but he is not a good fit for the job.

Since my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails,  Comey said Sunday in a follow-up letter to Congress.  During that time we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hilary Clinton as secretary of state. Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusion.

167, Racists’ Heads Will Explode When They Find Out White-On-White Crime Is Higher,"Despite what many racists say and regardless of the hand-picked statistics of the federal government in an effort to demonize black people, the rate of white-on-white crime in the United States is far higher than that of African-Americans victimizing white citizens.In a report published last Thursday by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) on  Race and Hispanic Origin of Victims and Offenders 2012-2015,  some staggering figures emerged. Research conducted over a four year period during which  U.S. residents experienced 5.8 million violent victimizations each year  found that the rate of white-on-white violent crime (12.0 per 1,000) was almost four times higher than black-on-white violent crime (3.1 per 1,000).However, even when the facts are blatantly obvious and staring them right in the face, there is no swaying some Republicans who still subscribe to the idea that African-Americans are still the largest threat to themselves and others. Case in point: former White House advisor Sebastian Gorka in this interview last Monday:On a Sinclair station, Gorka refers to ""black African crime on black African crime"" & says black men are killing each other ""by the bushel"" pic.twitter.com/Cbtqm39tTd  Yashar Ali ? (@yashar) October 24, 2017Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill, an African-American himself, shares the same sentiments as Gorka. One of the most dramatically difficult things to fathom in this country is the amount of lives lost   black lives lost   as a result of black-on-black violence,  Hill said on Saturday. In the same year that we experienced about 259 police officer shootings of blacks in 2015, there were 6,000 black lives lost to murders from black people. However, contrary to what both Mr. Gorka and Mr. Hill believe, black men aren t killing each other  by the bushel.  In fact, according to the report, black-on-black violence has decreased exponentially in the last two decades, by almost the exact same rate as white-on-white violence. From 1994 to 2015, white-on-white violence and black-on-black violence declined at a similar rate. White-on-white violence declined 79 percent (from 52.5 to 10.8 victimizations per 1,000 white persons). Black-on-black violence declined 78 percent (from 66.6 to 14.5 victimizations per 1,000 black persons). Information on Hispanic origin of offenders was not collected prior to 2012,  the report stated.It s time that the U.S. government started to report the facts when it comes to the issue of race, instead of dividing the country.Featured image via Brian Blanco/Getty Images",News,"October 30, 2017"
16594,BREAKING! INVESTIGATION: Hillary Clinton Did NOT Comply With Records Rules," Was Hillary Clinton negligent or was she doing this on purpose? Either way, it s a really bad situation and gives more fodder for the Trump campaign. Keep at it!The State Department inspector general concluded that Hillary Clinton did not comply with the agency s policies on records, according to a report released to lawmakers on Wednesday that also revealed that Clinton and her top aides chose not to cooperate with the review.The agency on Wednesday released the long-awaited report to Capitol Hill, copy of which was obtained by POLITICO, providing just the latest turn in the headache-inducing saga that has dogged Clinton s campaign.While the report concludes that the agency suffers from  longstanding, systemic weaknesses  with records that  go well beyond the tenure of any one Secretary of State,  it specifically dings Clinton for her exclusive use of private email.The watchdog s findings could exact further damage to Clinton s campaign, and they provide fresh fodder for Trump, who has already said he will go after Clinton for the email scandal  bigly.  The Democratic frontrunner s bid for the White House has already been hindered by high unfavorability ratings, with people saying they don t trust her. The report represents the latest pushback   in this case by a nonpartisan government entity   against her campaign s claim that she did not break any rules and that her use of a private server was completely allowed. The report also details how some technology staff said they were instructed to not talk of Clinton s email set-up after they raised concerns about the unusual arrangement. It also includes conflicting information about whether the private email server had been approved by the State Department s legal staff. Read more: POLITICO",Government News,"May 25, 2016"

Gutierrez was widely ridiculed, and many on social media like Twitter pointed out that in fact they would love to have a taco truck nearby   tacos are one of the most popular food items in the United States, as the ubiquitous Taco Bell chain would indicate.Democrats took the absurd taco truck comment and began using it to make fun of the Trump campaign. In some locations, taco trucks have now been used as part of voter registration drives in order to get new voters to the polls in November.Trump s anti-immigrant campaign, specifically targeted at Latino immigrants, is expected to prompt an increase in voter registration and participation within the Latino community. The fastest growing ethnic demographic in the United States, Latinos were once seen by the Republican Party in the era of George W. Bush as a route to electoral dominance.

Friday on ABC s  The View,  Republican presidential candidate and former CEO of Hewlett-Packard Carly Fiorina fought toe to toe with the co-hosts over their comments disparaging her face as demented  and a  Halloween Mask. After small talk, Whoopi Goldberg brought up the subject saying,  How about humor? I m going the bring it up because there are going to be lots of comics saying lots of things. I wondered, because we saw some of the that you were a little upset with us about a comic comment that was made. And so, how will you steel your skin? How will you get a thicker skin to accept some of the humorous things that will be said about you? Fiorina said,  Well, hey, if you meant your comment about my face being demented and a Halloween mask as humorous, so be it. I guess you misinterpreted Donald Trump s questions. I have a real thick skin. Joy Behar said,  I defended you against Donald Trump s comment. He s running for president of the United States and he was making a nasty comment about your looks. I took him on. On this show, but, we are comedians here. I make fun of Hillary s pantsuits. Hillary s husband s sex life. Rep. John Boehner s tan. Who else? I don t understand why any politician is exempt from my jokes. Here s the clip from Carly s awesome interview:Fiorina answered,  You know what, Joy. You know what, Joy? You can say whatever you want. You always have. You always will. I m not going to stop that. And don t worry, I have skin plenty thick enough to the take whatever people throw at me. I m making a different point. The different point is this. I think that there are real issues in this nation that we ought to be able to discuss in a fact-based, civil fashion. Michelle Collins said,  I want to add that the demented comment was a poor choice of words. It was responding to something you said during the debates. That people were telling you the smile more. To me, it felt like it was not your natural state of mind. It was not on your looks, it was on your expression. It felt like you were being told to smile more. I m wondering, is that difficult for you? Do you have people coaching you to act or be a different way? Will that help you win the election? Fiorina shot back,  First of all, I don t have people coaching me to act a different way or be a different way. There s a time to smile and a time to be serious. When you re talking about burying a child, it s not time to smile. There are serous issues facing the nation. Goldberg said,  We had you here. I thought we were pretty respectful. I have to tell you, having watched some of the press that you have garnered based on this fake feud with  The View,  I m a little taken aback. Because you kind of said that that somehow liberal women are that we re made uncomfortable by conservative women. We were not uncomfortable with you. Did you think we were uncomfortable with you when you were on? Fiorina said,  First of all, Whoopi. I enjoyed being on the show. The first time. and I m enjoying being on the show the second time. And I think  The View  garnered a lot of publicity over the feud as well. I think that s why we re on. Goldberg said,   We haven t put out any ads or anything.

9263,BARACK OBAMA GOES THERE…Compares President Trump To Hitler In Front Of Chicago Audience,"Crains Chicago Business   American democracy is fragile, and unless care is taken it could follow the path of Nazi Germany in the 1930s.Mixed in with many softer comments, that was the somewhat jaw-dropping bottom line of Barack Obama last night as, in a Q&A session before the Economic Club of Chicago, the Chicagoan who used to be president dropped a bit of red meat to a hometown crowd that likely is a lot closer to him than the man whose name never was mentioned: President Donald Trump.Obama s comments came after a series of playful questions from moderator and Ariel Investments President Mellody Hobson in the great Batman vs. Superman debate, for instance, we learned Obama sides with Batman before she eventually asked him what he s learned as a world citizen of sorts.One thing he s learned is that  things don t happen internationally if we don t put our shoulder to the wheel,  Obama said, speaking of the U.S.  No other country has the experience and bandwith and ideals. . . .If the U.S. doesn t do it, it s not going to happen. Obama gave one specific example, but it was a solid one: Ebola. To fight the virus the U.S. did everything from build an airport tarmac in Africa to send in medical teams and ferry medicos from other countries.  We probably saved a million lives by doing that,  he said.At least indirectly, those comments could be seen as criticism of Trump, whose foreign policy focuses on an  America first  paradigm that critics say distracts from this country s unique role.Obama moved from that to talking about a nativist mistrust and unease that has swept around the world. He argued that such things as the speed of technical change and the uneven impact of globalization have come too quickly to be absorbed in many cultures, bringing strange new things and people to areas in which  people didn t (used to) challenge your assumptions.  As a result,  nothing feels solid,  he said.  Sadly, there s something in us that looks for simple answers when we re agitated. Still, the U.S. has survived tough times before and will again, he noted, particularly mentioning the days of communist fighter Joseph McCarthy and former President Richard Nixon. But one reason the country survived is because it had a free press to ask questions, Obama added. Though he has problems with the media just like Trump has had,  what I understood was the principle that the free press was vital. The danger is  grow(ing) complacent,  Obama said.  We have to tend to this garden of democracy or else things could fall apart quickly. That s what happened in Germany in the 1930s which, despite the democracy of the Weimar Republic and centuries of high-level cultural and scientific achievements, Adolph Hitler rose to dominate, Obama noted.  Sixty million people died. . . .So, you ve got to pay attention. And vote. ",politics,"Dec 6, 2017"
9237,GERMANY: Afghan “Teen” Refugee Who RAPED and KILLED Female Med Student and Refugee Volunteer Is Actually 33-Years Old…And There’s MORE!,"On September 5, 2017, the Daily Mail reported:Afghan asylum seeker accused of raping and murdering EU official s teenage daughter  attacked her to satisfy his sexual urges before leaving her unconscious in a river to drown Hussein Khavari, 22, who claims to be from Afghanistan has been accused of ambushing Maria Ladenburger, 19, as she cycled home after a party, raping her and then drowning her in Freiburg, Germany last October.He was linked through his DNA to medical student Maria, who volunteered at various shelters that house migrants in her spare time in Freiburg.Hussein claimed to be Afghani but the court heard that there is evidence he is Iraqi. And his claim to be 17 at the time of the offense was disputed by a specialist saying he was at least 22. According to Bild newspaper, during a morning session of hearings in which press and public were excluded, he claimed to be 19.He said he claimed to be 16 upon his arrival in Germany in 2015  because the situation is better here for underage migrants.  The court must decide if he is to be tried as a juvenile or an adult.A murder conviction as a juvenile would mean a maximum ten-year jail term, as an adult a possible life sentence.As it turns out, the fake  teenager  who admitted to raping and murdering the actual teenager, is pretty far removed from his teenage years. According to the Voice of Europe,  the Afghan refugee, who is now on trial for the rape and murder of the medical student Maria Ladenburger in October 2016, is older than previously thought.Hussein Khavari entered Germany in November 2015 without identity papers. He told authorities that he was born in 1999 in Afghanistan and that his father was killed during the war.But it now appears that his father is still alive. According to German media source, Bil.de, his father said his son was born in 1984 and that he is 33-years-old.The Local Germany says about it:  Prosecutors were able to track down Hussein K. s father when they came across a contact on his mobile phone. The defendant told them that they could contact his mother on the number. But when an interpreter called the number in the presence of two judges, the person who picked up was his father .Maria Ladenburger s father is a senior legal adviser to the European Commission in Brussels. Maria herself was volunteering as a refugee worker in various shelters and asylum homes. ",politics,"Dec 9, 2017"
7901, Donald Trump Thanks The ‘Poorly Educated’ For Handing Him Victory In Nevada (VIDEO),"Donald Trump moved ever closer to securing the Republican nomination for President of the United States this week with victory in the Nevada caucus.There s no way around it   Trump thrashed his opponents in Nevada. He won a massive 45.9% of the vote, knocking Marco Rubio into 2nd place with just 23.9%, and Cruz in 3rd on 21.4%. It appears that the Trump campaign is unassailable at this point, although a week is a long time in U.S. politics.Graphic via GuardianPerhaps the darkest moment of the night was when Trump actually said these words in his victory speech: We won with poorly educated! I love the poorly educated! There were whopping cheers and applause for this comment. Which seemingly bore zero irony. He continued: We re the smartest people. We re the most loyal people. First things first: Donald Trump is not poorly educated. He attended the Kew Forest School until 8th grade before spending the rest of his schooling in the New York Military Academy. He later won a bachelors degree in Economic from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. So, another total lie from this candidate.One reason  poorly educated  might appeal to Trump though, is that part of the education process is to give a person the tools to think critically about an issue, and to fact-check arguments. It is not to say you cannot have these skills without a decent high school education, but it s an uphill struggle. It s not impossible to save a person having a heart attack without having had medical training, but you d put your money on the doctor every time.So, now wonder Trump would like to keep America under-educated.According to leading fact-checking site Politifact, just 1% of claims made by Donald Trump are true. One percent! Meanwhile, 3 out of every 5 statements he makes are absolute lies. Let s take a look back at some of those lies:They just keep on coming.And on the matter of faith, Donald Trump is now claiming to be some sort of born again evangelical. Yet, Trump has been married three times, pokes fun of Holy Communion as eating  the little cracker , claims he has never asked God to forgive his sins in his life, and could not name a single passage of the Bible when pressed for his favorite piece of scripture.Trump is about as devout a Christian as Bill Nye.And yet, he is winning evangelical support in droves. Why? Because the evangelical, Christian Conservative movement has zero to do with faith in God, and everything to do with a fanatical conviction in right-wing principles of crony capitalism, white supremacy, homophobia and sexism.If this was not the case, Trump would be the LAST candidate that appealed to Evangelicals. To any right-thinking Christian, he is the 21st century incarnation of the Whore of Babylon.But Trump gets a pass for all of this, because under-educated people are having their ignorance exploited, and bigoted people are having their bellies tickled. This resurgent right is euphoric that it s candidate can say things on national television that have been outlawed in workplaces and public spaces for decades. They are thrilled that hate has been made mainstream by their candidate, and they are going to come out in their droves to support him.This means that voting in this year s election will be the most important ballots cast on American soil in a very long time. The reproductive rights of women, the rights of LGBT Americans, the rights of non-Christians, the rights of victims of rape and sexual assault, the rights of victims of gun crime, the rights of non-white Americans   they are all on the chopping block in this election.  Every American with a conscience and a sense of decency has the absolute duty to make a stand against this sh*tstorm of stupidity, bigotry and ignorance.

7088, This Is What REAL Christians Do When Their Priest Preaches To Ban Abortion (VIDEO),"The members of a Roman Catholic church in Poland have demonstrated to the world how compassionate Christians can shut down priest when they preach politics, not religion, from the pulpit.The women were at a Roman Catholic church in Gdansk, which is spearheading the outlawing of abortion in the Eastern European country. The Priest began reading a letter to the congregation in favor of the ban, which triggered a large number of mostly female worshippers to stand, turn their back on the Priest, and leave the church.As The Journal reports:The message from Poland s Catholic bishops, presented at churches nationwide, called on lawmakers to back the proposal being considered by Poland s right-wing government.The move would tighten what are already some of Europe s most restrictive laws on pregnancy termination. Current legislation, dating from 1993, already bans all terminations except when pregnancy results from rape or incest, poses a health risk to the mother, or if the foetus is severely deformed.Pro-life activists support even tougher legislation but the move has sparked a backlash and thousands of marchers took part in a protest outside the country s parliament in Warsaw yesterday, as well as in several other cities.The move is in sharp contrast to Christian conservatives in the United States, who are actually rallying behind candidates and religious leaders who wear their prejudice and intolerance on their sleeve. Even Pope Francis is being pilloried by the Christian Right in America for his refusal to hate and preach against Muslims.In fact, there is not a candidate left in the GOP race for president who believes in a woman s reproductive rights over her own body. Donald Trump believes women should be  punished for having abortions. Ted Cruz would outlaw abortion, with  no exceptions    even in cases of incest or rape. Even the candidate who is selling himself as the moderate, John Kasich, also calls for a total ban on abortion. There is no pro-choice version of the Republican message anymore.In economic policy, the ultra-right of the conservative movement has killed off the Eisenhower Republicans   the GOP lawmakers and voters who believed in investment, taxation and welfare as the pillars which support free enterprise and a stable, prosperous society. At the same time, the evangelists have killed any hope of social liberalism in the party.What s left behind is a cold, cruel, and crazy mob, who simply do not care about facts, evidence or rational discussion. They are zealots. Let us hope that for the sake of the Republican Party, and the country, that a complete slaughtering in election 2016 brings everyone back to their senses. https://www.facebook.com/Channel4News/videos/10153656792786939/?__mref=message_bubbleFeatured Image via Screengrab",News,"April 5, 2016"

Donald Trump, when you look from what he said the other day about the gender bill and using the bathrooms, it proves that point because he knows how to appeal to not only Libertarians but to Independents who support that, too.

8145, Columbine Shooter Dylan Klebold’s Mother Breaks Silence In Riveting New Interview (VIDEOS),"Columbine was the original school shooting. Sure, there had been others, but that was the one that got the world s attention. It was the horror that was to become all too common in America s high schools and colleges. On that fateful day   April 20, 1999   the nation was rocked when 17-year old Dylan Klebold and 18-year-old Eric Harris went to their own high school and opened fire. They wounded 24 victims and killed 13 more. The truly horrific part of all of this is the fact that it could have been much worse   because, even more than a school shooting, Columbine was a failed bombing. Klebold and Harris had brought several homemade propane bombs with them in their efforts to make sure their attack on their school reached maximum effect   but the bombs failed to detonate.In the past, the parents of these infamous school shooters have refused to talk to the press on television. However, that all changed when Sue Klebold, Dylan Klebold s mother, decided to break her silence and sit down for an intimate interview with Diane Sawyer   her first television appearance ever regarding her son s devastating crimes.Mrs. Klebold talked about the guilt she has lived with over what her son did, and about the many things that she missed that, in hindsight, may have prevented this travesty, saying: I had all those illusions that everything was OK because, and more than anything else, because my love for him was so strong. Klebold then acknowledges that she understands why some parents blame her, why they believe that she and her husband should have seen that something was not right with their son long before he took it upon himself to commit any such atrocity. Before Columbine happened I would have been one of those parents. If I had recognized that Dylan was experiencing some real mental distress, he would not have been there. He would ve gotten help. I don t ever, for a moment, mean to imply that I m not conscious of the fact that he was a killer, because I am. Klebold hopes to help parents who might be unknowingly missing the signs that they might be raising killers by speaking out, both in this interview, and the book she has written, entitled A Mother s Reckoning, which will come out next week. Klebold says what we all know: that hindsight is always 20/20. I wish I had known then what I know now: that it was possible for everything to seem fine with him when it was not, and that behaviors I mistook as normal for a moody teenager were actually subtle signs of psychological deterioration. Perhaps the most powerful lesson comes from an essay Sue Klebold wrote for O Magazine, which is that you try to protect your kids from outside dangers, and can often fail to recognize the internal ones. She says in the essay:  I taught him how to protect himself from a host of dangers: lightning, snake bites, head injuries, skin cancer, smoking, drinking, sexually transmitted diseases, drug addiction, reckless driving, even carbon monoxide poisoning. It never occurred to me that the gravest danger   to him and, as it turned out, to so many others   might come from within. Most of us do not see suicidal thinking as the health threat that it is. We are not trained to identify it in others, to help others appropriately, or to respond in a healthy way if we have these feelings ourselves. Hopefully, this brave mother accomplishes her goal of saving lives through telling her own story, and hopefully she can one day find some kind of peace with what her son did.You can watch Sue Klebold tell her story in the clips below, courtesy of ABC News: ABC Breaking News | Latest News Videos ABC Breaking News | Latest News Videos ABC Breaking News | Latest News Videos ABC Breaking News | Latest News VideosFeatured image from video screen capture via ABC News",News,"February 13, 2016"
21405,ILLEGALS BEFORE AMERICAN CITIZENS: ACLU Sues 3 Missouri Colleges For Refusing Tuition Benefits To Illegal Aliens,"Obama s fundamental transformation of America s education system The American Civil Liberties Union is suing three public colleges in Missouri for denying in-state tuition to illegal immigrants, claiming that the law the schools are following is invalid.The Missouri chapter of the ACLU announced in a press release Tuesday that it has filed lawsuits against the University of Missouri, St. Louis Community College, and the Metropolitan Community College in Kansas City on behalf of three students who recently experienced tuition increases that the organization considers illegal.All three students are enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which grants immunity from deportation to individuals who arrived in the country illegally before the age of 16, but does not confer actual citizenship.The tuition hikes came after the state passed a bill this summer, HB 3, stating that  no funds shall be expended at public institutions of higher education that offer a tuition rate to any student with an unlawful immigration status in the United States that is less than the tuition rate charged to international students. Missouri law already prohibited public colleges and universities from providing institutional financial aid to students who are  unlawfully present in the United States,  but The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that some lawmakers had become concerned that the language would not apply to DACA students, prompting them to propose the new wording in an effort to clarify the law s meaning.Despite the misgivings of some administrators, the state s colleges dutifully complied, sending letters to affected students in July informing them of the mandated tuition increases even as some schools sought to offset the hikes with other forms of financial aid funded by private donations, which the law allows.Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon, however, offered a conflicting interpretation of the bill upon signing it into law, arguing that the language in question is not legally binding because it occurs in the preamble of the bill, rather than in the body. The Governor has been quite clear in order to change the law, you have to pass legislation,  press secretary Scott Holste told St. Louis Public Radio.  The language in the enacting clause of House Bill 3 or in the enacting clause of any other bill is not legally binding nor is it enforceable.  Via: Campus Reform",left-news,"Oct 19, 2015"

Judge Moore has stood in the gap for us, taken the brunt of the attack, and has done so with a rare, unconquerable resolve. As a consequence of his unwavering faith in God and his immovable convictions for Biblical principles, he was ousted as Chief Justice in 2003. As a result, he continued his life pursuit by starting the Foundation for Moral Law, which litigates religious liberty cases around our Nation. After being re-elected again to Chief Justice in 2012, by an overwhelming majority, he took another round of persecution for our faith as he stood up for the sanctity of marriage between one man and one woman. You can know a man by his enemies, and he s made plenty   from the radical organizations such as the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ACLU to the liberal media and a handful of establishment politicians from Washington. He has friends too, a lot of them. They live all across this great State, work hard all week, and fill our pews on Sunday. They know him as a father, a grandfather, a man who loves God s Word and knows much of it by heart, a man who cares for the people, a man who understands our Constitution in the tradition of our Founding Fathers, and a man who deeply loves America. It s no wonder the Washington establishment has declared all-out war on his campaign. We are ready to join the fight and send a bold message to Washington: dishonesty, fear of man, and immorality are an affront to our convictions and our Savior and we won t put up with it any longer.

9469,WATCH: ARROGANT Sexual Predator and Sometimes “Comedian” Louis C.K. Tells Stephen Colbert “Donald Trump Is An Insane Bigot and Hitler”,"The not so funny comedian Louis C.K. appeared on the Stephen Colbert show mostly to talk about his decision to send an email to his fans, where he told them that  Donald Trump is an insane bigot and Hitler . After the self-righteous  comedian  got some laughs from Colbert s liberal audience, Colbert asked them to settle down, that Louis C.K. admitted that after he sent the email, he  regretted it.   C.K. went on to say that he didn t really regret it, he just regretted  saying it , or in other words, he regrets that he was outed as a whiny, liberal, crybaby who can t control his emotions (our translation). One of the most interesting lines in the interview came after the Trump bashing where the outed sexual predator tells Colbert,  I wouldn t take it back. If you went back and fixed all the mistakes you made, you erase yourself. You know, there s just no point to that.  Good luck trying to  erase yourself  after you ve been outed creep Here s part of Louis C.K. s email to his fans: Please stop it with voting for Trump. It was funny for a little while. But the guy is Hitler. And by that I mean that we are being Germany in the 30s. Do you think they saw the shit coming? Hitler was just some hilarious and refreshing dude with a weird comb over who would say anything at all.And I m not advocating for Hillary or Bernie. I like them both but frankly I wish the next president was a conservative only because we had Obama for eight years and we need balance. And not because I particularly enjoy the conservative agenda. I just think the government should reflect the people. And we are about 40 percent conservative and 40 percent liberal. When I was growing up and when I was a younger man, liberals and conservatives were friends with differences. They weren t enemies. And it always made sense that everyone gets a president they like for a while and then hates the president for a while. But it only works if the conservatives put up a good candidate. A good smart conservative to face the liberal candidate so they can have a good argument and the country can decide which way to go this time.Trump is not that. He s an insane bigot. He is dangerous.Watch Louis C.K. joke around with Stephen Colbert about his disdain for President Trump, calling him a  Gross crook, dirty, rotten, lying sack of sh*t. The not so funny  comedian  was outed today as a serial sexual predator.NPR reported that Louis C.K. masturbated in front of multiple female colleagues, to their shock and dismay, according to women who spoke on the record to The New York Times about their experiences.The famous comic has been surrounded by rumors of sexual misconduct for years   specifically, allegations that he would masturbate in front of female colleagues.Last year, the comedian Roseanne Barr told The Daily Beast that C.K. was  about to get busted  for his conduct.  It s Louis C.K., locking the door and masturbating in front of women comics and writers. I can t tell you I ve heard so many stories,  she said. Comedian Tig Notaro acknowledged the allegations this summer and said C.K. needed to  handle  them.But previously, those stories were shared secondhand. Now, five women have spoken to the Times directly, with only one requesting anonymity. You can read the full story   which goes into much more detail   over at the New York Times.This Twitter user nailed it when it comes to just how disgusting Louis C.K. really is:Guys like Louis CK could just pay a sex worker. Could even request the sex worker play like she's uncomfortable if they likes. But they don't want that. The pleasure is in the actual discomfort of their victims, the power to overwhelm or make them just take it. It's horrendous.

20809,WHY “MODERATE” MUSLIMS DON’T SPEAK OUT: Muslim Shopkeeper Makes Video Wishing Customers “Happy Easter”…Muslim Man Stabs Him To Death [VIDEO],"The religion of peace and tolerance strikes again A shopkeeper was murdered by a fellow Muslim after he wished his Christian friends a peaceful Easter.Asad Shah, who was stabbed up to 30 times at his shop, had praised both the life of Jesus and  his beloved Christian nation . Left lying in a pool of blood, the 40-year-old died in hospital. Police, who were questioning a 32-year-old suspect last night, said the killing was religiously motivated.Mohammad Faisal, a family friend, said a bearded Muslim wearing a long religious robe entered Mr Shah s shop and spoke to him in his native language before stabbing him in the head with a kitchen knife.Mr Shah s brother, who was working next door, rushed out to find the killer laughing while sitting on the Glasgow newsagent s bleeding chest. The brother dragged Mr. Shah away but the guy continued attacking with the blade,  said Mr Faisal.  They struggled up to the bus stop where Asad collapsed. It was just a clear-cut revenge attack. For posting messages about peace, messages about greeting fellow Christians and Jews. Here is the video Asad Shah posted that inspired his brutal murder by a fellow Muslim: Before his death, Mr Shah had wished his friends a  Good Friday and a very happy Easter, especially to my beloved Christian nation .In his final post, he wrote:  Let s follow the real footstep of beloved holy Jesus Christ and get the real success in both worlds. Mr Shah also appeared to use his Facebook page to speak out over the attacks in Brussels. Via: Daily Mail",left-news,"Mar 28, 2016"
14856,GOP HOUSE LEADERSHIP Place Political Careers Before National Security: Why They Are Reportedly Caving (Again) To Democrats,"Is this why we worked so hard to get a GOP majority in the House and Senate? Spineless weasels Republican House members blasted their GOP leadership Wednesday for caving to Democratic leaders  demand that they abandon the House s bipartisan bill to tighten screening of refugee applicants from Syria and Iraq. The bill to bolster the Syrian and Iraqi [refugee] vetting process passed with a veto-proof majority and is supported by a vast majority of Americans,  said Rep. Richard Hudson (R-NC)57% , who is one of the two co-authors of the original House bill that GOP leaders are now abandoning. It would be a shame to bow to the wishes of Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) and the White House, leaving our country vulnerable to foreign terrorism,  he told Breitbart News exclusively.After the Paris attacks that killed over 120 people, the House passed a bill   with a huge bipartisan majority   that would implement tough screening requirements for refugees. The bill was criticized by Democrats and President Obama, who vowed to veto the legislation and suggested that Republicans work with them to tighten oversight of visas given to legal visitors.Now, House Republican leaders are reportedly planning to abandon their original idea to tighten screening of refugees and are instead caving to Democrats who want to only fix security gaps in the legal-visitor visa program.Republican House leadership is backing away from the refugee problem because they fear their fix will be rejected by Democrats and lead to a partial government shut-down.Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL) also told Breitbart News exclusively that he isn t  surprised  that Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) is following in the steps of former House Speaker Rep. John Boehner (R-OH)32% by bowing to Democrats, rather than putting up a fight.He called the original vote  a show vote  that was arranged by the leaders, and told Breitbart News that the entire refugee program needs to be stripped of its funding.Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX) told Breitbart News exclusively that GOP House leadership should fix both problems.  This should not be an either or question,  Babin said.  Both should be addressed in a timely manner. We should concern ourselves first and foremost with the safety and security of the American people. Babin recently released a letter, signed by more than 70 of his colleagues, calling on House leadership to include language in the must-pass omnibus spending bill that would defund the refugee resettlement program. More than 70 of my colleagues joined me in calling for an immediate suspension in the refugee program to give us time to put in place security measures that the Administration has failed to implement  Babin told Breitbart News. We must restore Congressional authority and ensure that Congress has a final sign-off on any Administration proposed Security measures. Congress has until December 11th to pass the omnibus bill.Via: Breitbart News",politics,"Dec 2, 2015"
3578, WATCH: Democrats Release Video PERFECTLY Highlighting Hypocrisy Of Trump’s Appointments,"Despite his promises to  drain the swamp,  Trump is doing the exact opposite. So far, his cabinet picks are basically a  who s who  of Washington insiders and big business executives, making the swamp slimier than ever.And the Democratic Party isn t missing the opportunity to highlight Trump s incompetence and hypocrisy.In a 30-second video released on Twitter, the Democrats lambasted Trump for hiring the very idiots who caused the financial crisis to undo all of the hard work done by the Obama administration to pull this country back from the brink of financial ruin.You can watch the video below: We ve seen so much economic growth over the last 6 years. Now Donald Trump is hiring the people who created the crisis we recovered from. pic.twitter.com/F7nQqDCmUM  The Democrats (@TheDemocrats) December 3, 2016Although the list is always changing (you can see a live updated version by The New York Times here), here s a quick rundown of his current appointments and their anything-but outsider backgrounds:Steve Bannon is a white supremacist and nationalist, and architect of Breitbart, which he has called a platform of the  alt-right.  Alt-right is the politically correct word for neo-Nazis that can t stand being called neo-Nazis. He was also an investment banker at Goldman-Sachs, and ran his own financial firm, Bannon & Co.Reince Priebus, who was chairman to the RNC and instrumental in the rise of Paul Ryan, Scott Walker, and others, is about as establishment as you can get. He s a lawyer and career politician, and was the chairman of one of two major political parties. What is more establishment than that?! Yet, for his early promotion of the Donald, he s getting rewarded with a spot in the White House. Trump doesn t give a damn about draining the swamp; he s giving favors to friends.Flynn isn t as bad as Trump s other picks at first glance, that is. He seems to have no clue what he s talking about with regard to many political issues, but on the subject of national security, he does at least have some expertise. Unfortunately, that expertise is tempered with a  let s bomb the shit out of everything!  attitude combined with extreme Islamophobia. Lovely. He s also been reported to have a loose relationship with the truth. A leaked email from former Secretary of State and four-star general Colin Powell is even more telling: I spoke at DIA last month,  Powell wrote to his son, Michael, on July 19 before relaying a story he apparently heard from Marine Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, the current DIA director.  Flynn got fired as head of DIA. His replacement is a black Marine 3-star. I asked why Flynn got fired. Abusive with staff, didn t listen, worked against policy, bad management, etc. He has been and was right-wing nutty every [sic] since.  (The Washington Post)Come on, Trump, you can t do better than that? Who am I kidding   of course you can t.None of those require Senate confirmation, so they re already a done deal. The following names, however, are not yet set in stone, but are likely:I won t get into the many, many terrible policy positions of Jeff Sessions. That s not important here. What is important is that he is another career politician who is owned by the insurance industry and has no interest in fighting for the common citizen. He s yet another swamp monster in an administration that won an election on the promise of changing business as usual in Washington.It s hard to know where to start with Betsy DeVos. Her desire to privatize education, not improve it? Her belief in creationism? The fact that she thinks Christianity belongs in public schools? Or maybe just that she s another billionaire swamp monster? She married into Amway money. Amway, if you re not familiar, is a massive pyramid scheme under investigation in many countries for its  multi-level marketing  scam ( multi-level marketing  is code for  pyramid scam ). It s one of the largest privately held companies in the United States. And she is a HUGE political donor who is very fond of money influencing the political process.You know who would make the best Secretary of the Treasury when you re trying to get rid of  business as usual  in Washington? A billionaire investment banker and hedge fund manager who spent 17 years at Goldman-Sachs, that s who! Here s a flashback to Trump just months ago: I m not going to let Wall Street get away with murder. Wall Street has caused tremendous problems for us. We re going to tax Wall Street. Huh. How about that.Steven Mnuchin been sued by Trump, partnered with George Soros, and has done basically anything he can to make as much money as possible. It s hard to see how liberals or conservatives would support him, but Trump supporters will follow him no matter what he does or how many promises he breaks.And in case you forgot, people like Mnuchin caused the Great Recession. Now we ve gone from not regulating them enough and allowing them to buy politicians to directly placing them in power! That s some great swamp draining right there.Wilbur Ross is a predatory billionaire investor and former banker. Is this starting to sound repetitive? He also served under Rudy Giuliani, as well as Bill Clinton, and has been both a Democrat and a Republican as the need arises. Not exactly a political outsider!And heads up, coal miners: He s currently under investigation by multiple agencies for his degree of responsibility in the deaths of a dozen coal miners in West Virginia. The mine that collapsed had over 200 safety citations, and he was  intimately familiar  with the company and problems in question during the time leading up to the incident. Do you think Trump really gives a flying fuck about you when he s hiring people like that?Elaine Chao has served under two previous Republican administrations already, as well as obtaining a White House fellowship under Reagan. She was the Secretary of Labor under Dubya, and the Deputy Secretary of Transportation under his marginally more competent father, President George H.W. Bush.She s also Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s wife. Not only that, but she s worked at multiple banks as well as the Heritage Foundation. She is as deeply embedded in the world of politics and the swamp of Washington as it is possible to be.With this list of Washington insiders and bank executives on their way onto the White House team, it s more clear than ever that everything Trump told his supporters during his campaign was a lie. He s in it for himself, his children, and his rich friends. After that, he ll listen to anybody that pretends they like him or tells him what he wants to hear.

19480,NOT KIDDING! Serial Liar Brian Williams Blames “FAKE NEWS” For Hillary’s Loss On MSNBC Last Night [VIDEO],"The man suspended from his TV anchor job for faking his own news is furious about the spread of  fake news. Brian Williams, who was forced to take a 6-month vacation before being permanently relieved of his  Nightly News  duties on NBC, railed about the new epidemic of  fake news  in his MSNBC show earlier this week. Fake news played a role in this election and continues to find a wide audience,  Williams whined Tuesday night in his middle-of-the-night show.Specifically, Williams singled out Trump s incoming national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, and his son for spreading falsehoods. Williams is no stranger to fake news. He was punished in February 2015 for lying about a helicopter ride in Iraq that he claimed came under heavy enemy fire.In 2003, Williams and an NBC team were reporting in Iraq when three Chinook helicopters came under fire.Williams claimed he was on one of the copters that were hit, when he aboard a different helicopter located about an hour behind the other three. I don t know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft with another,  Williams told  Stars and Stripes  after crew members from the helicopters that were hit that day came forward.Questions were also raised about Williams  coverage in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005.Williams claimed he could see bodies in flooding from his hotel room in the French Quarter.But the New Orleans Advocate reported that the French Quarter was largely spared in the catastrophe and saw little flooding.-NYP",left-news,"Dec 9, 2016"

2201, GOP Rep. Just Achieved The IMPOSSIBLE By Outdoing Trump’s Hypocrisy On February Jobs Report,"Trump continued to claim credit for things with which he had little to do when February s jobs report came out earlier today, and Sean Spicer even defended him to a press that wanted to know why jobs reports are suddenly authentic, when they were all fake under Obama. But the hypocrisy doesn t end there, apparently. Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, issued his own statement on the jobs report, and in doing so, he brought Republican hypocrisy to a whole new level.The February 2016 jobs report, which, of course, came out under Obama, showed 242,000 new jobs. Brady said: While it s good news that more Americans have joined the labor force, it s disappointing to see so little growth in full time work and wages. One year later, we have a jobs report that says 238,000 new jobs were created in February. Brady said: This is a great report. The fact that hundreds of thousands more people found new jobs last month is a good sign that our economy is moving in the right direction. Isn t 238,000 less than 242,000? Or is there some kind of new math of which we aren t yet aware? Really, partisan games and fuzzy math are the only explanation for Brady s saying he s very pleased about last month s jobs report   it s obviously because there s a Republican in the White House and Brady wants to kiss his ass.It also showcases Republicans  insistence on opposing everything that Obama ever did.Brady should have thought this out a little better. There s no way to spin the difference between the two statements as anything other than sheer GOP hypocrisy.Take a look at both full statements below:Kevin Brady on the February 2016 job report v.

This move by the Trump administration is likely in retaliation to the damning report published yesterday stating that the FBI refused the White House s request to publicly knock down media reports regarding communications between Donald Trump s associates and Russians known to U.S. intelligence during the 2016 presidential campaign.Even weirder, Spicer had that conversation with a reporter from Politico, an established media source he has now just banned.

10941,Son Of Egyptian Immigrants Hopes To Become FIRST MUSLIM GOVERNOR In U.S…Will Push For “Sanctuary State”,"Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, a liberal Democrat would like to become the nation s first Muslim Governor in a state that s home to the city of Dearborn, with the highest Muslim population outside of the Middle East. The state of Michigan also made news last year when Hamtramck, a city that for decades was known for it s strong Polish immigrant community, elected its first all-Muslim City Council. It s probably not that far-fetched that the son of Egyptian immigrants living in a state where tens of thousands of Muslim refugees and immigrants come to live would want to see the state of MI become a  Sanctuary State . My faith is really important to me, as it is for many Americans and Michiganders,  El-Sayed said.  But I think we should be asking ourselves rather than how one prays, or what they pray to, we should ask ourselves what [one] prays for and what one hopes for. While El-Sayed said his Islamic values are at the center of his work as a civil servant, he wants people to know his number one priority is to serve the people of Michigan.But some residents in the state may not be ready to see a Muslim governor. In the last several years, Michigan has been a hotbed of Islamophobia. Dearborn, a predominantly Arab-American city in the Detroit metro area, has been a frequent target of anti-Muslim activists, conspiracy theories and fake news. But El-Sayed doesn t want Michigan residents to be distracted by anti-Muslim rhetoric and violence   and he wants people to know that the principles of Islam are what guide his service. I am running because of the values my Islam teaches me   which includes beliefs in equity, the fundamental rights of all people, a belief that we will judge ourselves as a people based on how we treat the most vulnerable,  El-Sayed said.  A belief in being good to others fundamentally, a belief in respect and dignity to one s neighbors and one s friends and one s family. -Business InsiderDemocratic gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed is starting to propose a progressive platform that includes making Michigan a  sanctuary state,  providing universal preschool and offering publicly funded health insurance to any resident needing coverage.The ex-director of Detroit s health department unveiled parts of his platform Monday.I love it when the rule of law works #sanctuarycities https://t.co/3X4kJBu4WZ  Abdul El-Sayed (@AbdulElSayed) April 26, 2017El-Sayed claims that a Sanctuary State will make Michiganders safer. As a Michigander, I can assure you that making our state a  Sanctuary State  will not only make it less safe, but it will cause many people to move away to states who have laws against law-breakers.(3/3) if elected #gov my job is protecting #Michiganders, that's what #SanctuaryState will do.

9010, Racists Go CRAZY after Samuel L Jackson Trashes Trump On Jimmy Kimmel Live (VIDEO),"The racists came out in full force when Jimmy Kimmel put up a minute of video that is too outstanding to ignore. In a segment called,  The Hateful 8 Ball,  Kimmel gets advice from a mystical Samuel L Jackson inside a magic 8 ball toy. Jackson plays the part as you d expect, nailing the role of angry black man with iconic voice ever so perfectly.Definitely a great moment captured for all time   not only for a funny comedic piece, but as a historical record for the kind of racism that follows Donald Trump around. On hearing the name, the Trump trolls who keep this buffoon relevant enough that he might just win the GOP nomination hopped all over the comments on The Patriot Nation, the right-wing propaganda rag posting the video for other racists to be outraged at.This rocket doctor doesn t understand why racism has to be about race:When Bill Taylor, who went to Ball State University, says that President Obama had no qualifications other than he s black to run for president, that s it. All bets are off, Obama is worthless. Bill was obviously far too involved with the investigation into how little Obama was vetted to notice the birther movement, college transcript fiasco and fake Barry Soetoro stuff that still thrives in circles of stupidity all over the internet.Bill says he s a racist, pretty sure it s because he s black, not sure if we re talking about Jackson or Obama anymore; It s very sad.Then there are the people who just really are that stupid:It takes a classy person to be a Donald Trump supporter.

14878,Obama And Kerry Exposed: Secret Side Deals With Iran And No Nuclear Agreement,"Bravo! These two great Americans make me have hope for the politicians we elect. They re doing a damn good job of exposing the phony Iran deal. They both are veterans and super smart so maybe they ve been able to outsmart the Obama thugs. I love these guys!Rep. Mike Pompeo (R   Kan.) and Sen. Tom Cotton (R   Ark.) have a lot in common. Both are army veterans and both are graduates of Harvard Law School. And both have been doing a great job of exposing aspects of the nuclear deal with Iran that the administration would rather keep quiet.This week it was reported that an inquiry from Pompeo got the State Department to admit that the nuclear deal was never signed and is not  legally binding. Julia Frifield, the Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs, wrote in response to Pompeo s inquiry if he could see the signed agreement, in a letter reproduced at the congressman s website, that the nuclear deal was not binding and that it was not signed by any party. The key parts of the letter read:The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is not a treaty or an executive agreement, and is not a signed document   The success of the JCPOA will depend not on whether it is legally binding or signed, but rather on the extensive verification measures we have put in place, as well as Iran s understanding that we have the capacity to re-impose   and ramp up   our sanctions if Iran does not meet its commitments.Frifield asserted that the JCPOA was not a signed agreement but  reflections of political commitments  between Iran and the P5+1 nations   the United States, Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany.Pompeo responded,  For the State Department to try to defend the unsigned and non-binding Iran nuclear agreement by calling it a  political commitment  is about as absurd as the terms of the deal itself.   Instead of forging an agreement with Iran that will protect Americans and prevent the world s largest state sponsor of terror from obtaining a nuclear weapon, the Obama administration caved to Iranian bullies and serial nuclear cheaters. Unsigned, this agreement is nothing more than a press release and just about as enforceable. Pompeo, of course, knew that the deal was unsigned, but he got the State Department to admit it. What Cotton s letter did was expose the administration s ploy to evade Congressional oversight and still achieve the permanence of a treaty by going to the U.N. Security Council.The non-binding nature of the nuclear non-agreement isn t the only subterfuge that Cotton and Pompeo have exposed. It was also their questioning that led to the discovery of the secret side deals between Iran and the IAEA. One of the side deals allowed Iran to collect its own samples at the Parchin military base, an arrangement that non-proliferation experts Olli Heinonen, a former deputy director of the IAEA, and David Albright, head of the Institute for Science and International Security, said undermined the effectiveness of the JCPOA. (The scandal of self-inspection of Parchin had previously been brought up by Sen. Robert Menendez (D   N.J.) and Sen. James Risch (R   Idaho).)Cotton and Pompeo have been very good at exposing the weakness of the deal that the media wouldn t otherwise have reported. No doubt in the coming months Iran will continue testing the administration and the administration will continue retreating exposing further weaknesses in the deal. ",politics,"Nov 27, 2015"

7101, Supreme Court Unanimously Rejects Republican’s Latest Election Rigging Scheme,"In another humiliating defeat that will have major ramifications for Republicans going forward, all 8 Justices on the Supreme Court upheld a lower court s ruling that Texas Republicans could not redraw voting districts to suppress the growing Latino vote.The  one person, one vote  case was designed by conservatives to exclude non-voting populations when drawing the electoral map for the state. The immediate effect would be that districts with large numbers of non-eligible voters (like, for instance, Latino immigrants and children), would be lumped together, giving much more power to rural, mostly white and older, districts.I m sure you ll be shocked to know that older white people tend to vote Republican. But that surely wasn t the intent behind this move to consolidate power increase the fairness of elections for white people everyone.If this all sounds a bit confusing (and it should), what Republicans were trying to say is that people who can t vote, children, immigrants, convicted felons, etc. do not deserve the same kind of representation in their local government. Because they re not really people or something. But really, this was just the latest GOP attempt at rigging elections.Right now, the populations of large racially diverse cities mean that those cities have several (or more) voting districts and they tend to be far more liberal than rural, mostly white districts. That means that in a state like Texas, the cities are threatening to overpower the rural areas in terms of electoral power and turn the state purple and eventually blue. The goal of this court case was to reverse that trend and greatly reduce the number of city districts, thus, making the rural (and conservative) districts more powerful.But apparently this was a voter suppression tactic too far for even the conservatives on the Court:Six justices signed on to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg s decision, and Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas   the most conservative members of the court   concurred in the judgment. Total-population apportionment meets the equal protection demand, by rendering each representative alert to the interests and constituent-service requests of all who dwell in the representative s district,  Ginsburg said.Even if Scalia had still been alive, it looks like he might have been the only dissent. And maybe Thomas after Scalia had told him what to think.The conservative Justices were not opposed to the basic premise of the plan (stripping large cities of their voting power), just this particular method. Once Republicans come up with a new avenue of attack (and they will), they ll try it again and if Republicans control the White House and put another Scalia on the bench, they might get away with it next time.See why voting blue is important?Featured image via wikipedia ",News,"April 4, 2016"
13504,WAS MURDERED 27 YEAR OLD DEMOCRAT Operative About To Blow The Whistle On VOTER FRAUD When He Was Shot In The Back? [VIDEO],"Seth Rich was hired by the Democrat Party as the official  voter expansion data director.  Although there is no connection yet, he was clearly privy to information that could potentially harm the Democrat Party, and more specifically Hillary Clinton s chances of winning the election in November.  He was shot in the back several times but wasn t robbed. He was left to die a short distance from his home in gun-free Washington D.C . Possible Whistle Blower on Democratic Party Voter #Fraud assassinated in Washington DC,not in MsM https://t.co/Cbem0AJvw5 #DNC  Egypt Built (@HosamDakhakhni) July 12, 2016Rich s death isn t the only suspicious death with ties to the Clintons. A UN official tied to the Clintons was found in his apartment with his throat crushed by a barbell last month The UN claimed he died of a heart attack. Read HERE.Washington DC police are offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the killer or killers of Seth Rich, the idealistic young DNC employee who was mysteriously shot multiple times in the back on Sunday night in affluent Northwest DC.At the same time, police are still not giving out any more information about the investigation beyond saying that they have not yet connected the killing to a robbery. Officers have been canvassing the once-cheery Bloomingdale neighborhood where Rich lived and died, knocking on doors and asking for information.There is still no suspect, no motive, and no arrests. As a result, conspiracy theories about Rich s murder continue to fly around Washington and around social media worldwide.Rich was shot while walking home after 4 a-m on Sunday morning. He was on the phone with his girlfriend just before the attack. Police say his body bore injuries indicating that Rich fought for his life.Rich s father told the local TV station in his hometown of Omaha that the killers took nothing from his son s body. If it was a robbery-it failed because he still has his watch, he still has his money-he still has his credit cards, still had his phone so it was a wasted effort except we lost a life,  Joel Rich told KMTV.At a Tuesday news conference about DC crime statistics, DC Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier, stated that overall robberies were down in the city. When asked specifically about Seth Rich s murder, she said it has not been determined whether his death could be linked to a robbery.Conspiracy theories abound over Rich s death. The most controversial theory is that Rich was on his way, in the dead of night, to meet with the FBI and inform on alleged voter fraud by Hillary Clinton and DNC boss Debbie Wasserman Schultz. The theory goes that he was murdered to keep him silent.  HeatStreetAnita Moncreif worked for ACORN during Obama sHere are some interesting facts surrounding the Clinton connections with Seth Rich:SETH RICH was a young Washington D.C insider, hired by the Democratic National Committee/Convention, who was assassinated early this morning, July 11th. He was hired by Democratic National Committee Chairwoman (and former co-chair of HILLARY Clinton s 2008 campaign) Debbie Wasserman-Schultz in June 2014 as the official  voter expansion data director  for this election season.Here is what I personally find suspicious about his very recent death:Debbie Wasserman-Schultz criticized the Bernie Sanders campaign of hacking into the NGP VAN voter database back in December of last year. NGP VAN has previously contributed to the Clinton campaign. In addition, it could have been entirely possible, given the many scandals surrounding Clinton, that the Clinton campaign may have taken crucial information or restricted the Sanders campaign from having stronger momentum in the days leading up to the Iowa primary. This is an entirely different topic though. Certainly Mr. Rich would have been aware of the particular data hacked or taken at this time.Mr. Rich was hired by the DNC in June 2014. Earlier in 2014, the Clintons announced a voter initiative project meant at counteracting voter ID laws & the stripping of provisions in the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Another intention of this collaboration with the DNC was to increase voter turnout. Mrs. Wasserman-Schultz at the time said she wished to make sure that  everyone who wants to vote and is eligible has an opportunity to register, has an opportunity to turnout and can have their vote accurately counted.  However, it has been noted continuously by progressive media and r/sandersforpresident that Mrs. Wasserman-Schultz has deliberately done everything in her power to discourage voters from having their voices heard/accurately counted, thus creating another shield for Hillary Clinton from potentially losing to an  outsider  progressive. Could Mr. Rich have expressed a personal conflicting opinion after the NGP VAN leak which would ve made Mrs. Wasserman-Schultz more angry?Another Reddit user on r/politics noticed that Mr. Rich s LinkedIn Page detailed his work for a firm called Greenberg Quinlan Rosner. The CEO of this firm is a man named Stan Greenberg, a man who was a leading political strategist for Bill Clinton during his presidency. This man also re-branded BP as a  green  petroleum company. Is it possible that Mr. Rich was aware of the public s disdain for oil industry/fracking? Clearly going against the oil industry would mean a significant loss of profits. The U.S, as it is, has been oil dependent for ages, and the fight to change the climate has never been hotter than right now.In the months leading up to the BP oil spill, Mr. Rich was also a legislative affairs consultant for another firm called  Kissel E & S Associates.  When I happened to google  Kissel E&S Associates, Clinton , one of the front page results led to a University of Nebraska paper, and written during Hillary Clinton s tenure as Secretary of State. This paper is titled  Conflicts in the Licensing Process for TransCanada s Keystone XL Pipeline.  The Keystone XL Pipeline is one of the MANY positions on which Hillary Clinton has flip-flopped on. Could Mr. Rich have dissented with some very powerful oil company interests who were looking to negotiate a backroom deal with the DNC?Mr. Rich also happened to previously work for former Nebraska Senator & Governor Ben Nelson. Former Senator Nelson happens to be a more conservative-leaning Democrat, but he also happened to be on the Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittees on Homeland Security/Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and was a member of the International Conservation Caucus. Senator Nelson, in 2010, was the deciding vote to help block a Wall Street reform bill. He also contributed a crucial vote to help pass Obamacare back in 2009. Senator Nelson also suddenly quit his position in 2013, and was at the center of the Obamacare Supreme Court ruling last year. Finally, I don t think that this is related to the conspiracy theory at hand, but last October, his daughter died from an accidental fall.Mr. Rich was murdered in the back by an unknown assailant with a gun. At 4:20 in the morning. Near Howard University. Not exactly the type of person who would be targeted in a nicer area of D.C. (I am aware D.C has lots of impoverished areas/urban decay.) The District of Columbia happens to have a ban on the sale or purchase of handguns, but nearby Virginia has some of the most relaxed gun laws in the country. And although there are many insiders who work for Washington D.C, wouldn t it take someone with intelligence to know and particularly target somebody who happened to have crucial intelligence that could decide this election?The police, as of July 11, don t have any suspects, witnesses, or surveillance footage at this time. They also refused to comment if it was possibly related to recent robberies in the neighborhood. It can be disputed that this was but a botched robbery, however, because nothing was taken from Mr. Rich s dead body. One of the earliest rumored victims of the  Clinton body count  was Mary Mahoney, who died in a similar fashion as she was about to testify against Bill Clinton (and who had nothing taken from her body at the time of her death.) (In comparison, The Manson family didn t steal anything from Sharon Tate s house when they brutally murdered her and others. The Family was also accused of killing multiple potential dissenters during and after Manson s trial, for a sickening comparison.)The TIMING of this tragedy seems too  coincidental /accurately timed. I think/know that:8a. Mr. Rich s sudden death comes the day before Bernie Sanders is set to endorse Hillary Clinton at a party unity rally tomorrow. Chairwoman-elect of the Nebraska Democratic Party (Rich s home state), Jane Kleeb, spoke of Rich as  a young Nebraskan who worked on campaigns and stood for progressive issues. 8b. As of Monday the 11th, the Democratic National Convention is set to take place in exactly two weeks, and the Republican National Convention in exactly one. In addition, Bernie Sanders is set to speak at FDR Park on the 24th, about where the  political revolution  goes from here.8c. Hillary-supporting Governor of Connecticut Dan Malloy is currently under investigation over a Cigna merger. Hillary-supporting U.S Rep Corinne Brown is also currently under investigation over her super-gerrymandered Florida district (Wasserman-Schultz is from Florida).8d. There are currently RICO lawsuits investigating multiple counts of electoral fraud, and surprisingly, these lawsuits are pulling through the courts and gaining traction. Mr. Rich could have been aware of the American people actually standing a chance with these lawsuits, and given his access to crucial voter data, could have decided to be a DNC defector and testify on behalf of the people in charge of these electoral fraud lawsuits. 8e. There is still a possibility that Russia/Julian Assange has DNC information and could be planning to leak it to the public in time for the convention. Mr. Rich could have known of this.",politics,"Jul 16, 2016"
2061, Cowardly GOP Rep. Files Police Complaint Against SENIORS Because He’s TERRIFIED Of Dissent,"Republican members of Congress, who love claiming that they re the only party that stands for real Americans, are now terrified of their own constituents. This is happening for one simple reason   they never expected their own constituents to be angry with what they re doing on Capitol Hill. So instead of facing the music and admitting that the entire GOP platform is something Americans don t want, they re running scared.Such is the case with Idaho representative Raul Labrador. His office had the audacity to file a complaint against a group of people made up primarily of senior citizens because they were showing up at his office in Lewiston on a weekly basis to voice their displeasure with him and the GOP. Labrador obviously considers this a threat, and perhaps, if they d threatened violence it would be.But that s not what s happening. Chris Ankeny, the chief of police in Lewiston, the Idaho town where this is taking place, says these people were protesting in front of Labrador s offices and that no crimes had been committed. Employees are uncomfortable with them because of the national attention this group had garnered, not because of credible (or even in-credible) threats.Labrador s office contacted the D.C. Capitol Police over this because that force has jurisdiction over U.S. Congresspeople s offices in addition to Capitol Hill. They did so because they felt the Lewiston department wasn t doing anything. The thing is, a good police department won t do anything when they confirm that there s no crime happening (including threats). So what this is is an office full of people who can t handle dissent.The worst part is that this group has so many seniors, and Labrador won t hear them. These are people who may be worried about cuts to programs they depend on, including Medicare and Meals on Wheels. Others living in and around Lewiston are worried about climate change and clean energy. They say Labrador s absence from his offices is a sign of cowardice, and they re not wrong. He is a coward.Many Republicans have run away and hidden from their constituents lately because they can t tolerate the fact that their constituents  concerns run counter to the GOP s platform. They re too used to putting party above country. Maybe this is uncharted territory for them, but shouldn t these guys, who work for the very people they re pissing off, actually stop to listen?Or are they not what they ve been trying to sell to us?It s really disgusting that Labrador s office feels so threatened by non-violent, non-threatening protests from senior citizens that they ve had to file a complaint.Featured image by Gage Skidmore.

1921, WATCH: Chuck Todd Puts The Screws To Mitch McConnell For Not Giving Merrick Garland A Chance,"Mitch McConnell is still making ridiculous excuses to justify what Senate Republicans did to Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland.When Antonin Scalia passed away in February 2016, his body was not even cold before Republicans declared that they would refuse to hold hearings to confirm any replacement chosen by President Obama.And so, when President Obama selected a centrist judge named Merrick Garland to be the next Supreme Court Justice, Republicans immediately refused to do their job as outlined by the Constitution.Republicans tried to excuse their behavior by claiming that Democrats would have done the same thing even though Democrats have never once refused to grant a nominee a confirmation hearing. Furthermore, Republicans claimed that no Supreme Court nominee has ever been approved by the Senate in an election year.McConnell made the same claim on Sunday after Chuck Todd grilled him in response to Republican insistence that Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch be confirmed immediately. The tradition had been not to confirm vacancies in the middle of a presidential [election] year,  McConnell said.  You d have to go back 80 years to find the last time it happened. Everyone knew, including President Obama s former White House counsel, that if the shoe had been on the other foot, [Democrats] wouldn t have filled a Republican president s vacancy in the middle of a presidential election. Again, Democrats have never refused to hold a confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court nominee.Also, Mitch McConnell is ignorant of Senate history.As it turns out, there have been several election year confirmations of Supreme Court nominees and we don t have to go back 80 years to find one.In fact, the last one occurred only 29 years ago when the Senate confirmed Justice Anthony Kennedy in 1988 during Ronald Reagan s last year in office.It also happened in 1956 when Dwight Eisenhower nominated William Brennan. The Senate confirmed him despite it being an election year.In 1940, also an election year, Franklin Roosevelt nominated Frank Murphy to the Supreme Court and the Senate confirmed him.So contrary to what Mitch McConnell says, there is plenty of precedent in our history proving that the Senate has no such  tradition  of not confirming Supreme Court nominees during an election year.Todd challenged McConnell for not simply holding a confirmation hearing and giving Garland an up or down vote. Why not put him up for a vote?  Todd asked.  Any senator can have a rationale to not vote for a confirmation. Why not put Merrick Garland on the floor and if the rationale is,  You know what? Too close to an election,  then vote no? Look, we litigated that last year,  a flustered McConnell replied.  The American people decided that they wanted Donald Trump to make the nomination, not Hillary Clinton. Actually, the American people voted for Hillary Clinton. She won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes.McConnell then claimed that there s  no rational reason  to not vote to confirm Gorsuch. But that s not true either. You see, by refusing to grant Garland a confirmation hearing, Republicans set a precedent and gave Democrats all the reasons they need to block Gorsuch at all costs.Plus, Gorsuch has a terrible record and he was nominated by Trump, which is all the more reason for Democrats to block him.If Senate Republicans had not acted like petulant children in response to Merrick Garland, perhaps Democrats would have been more open. But the way Republicans treated Garland was un-American and totally outrageous. They disgraced the Senate with their conduct and Democrats now have precedent to respond in kind.But McConnell balked when Todd challenged him to take up a resolution that says Supreme Court vacancies won t be filled during an election year. In short, McConnell knows that if a Republican had been president in 2016, Senate Republicans would have rushed any Supreme Court nomination through. Because in the end, Republicans are hypocrites.Here s the video via YouTube.There is no excuse for Democrats to not block Neil Gorsuch from becoming a Supreme Curt Justice. In fact, if Republicans somehow get him confirmed, Democrats should impeach him as soon as they take back control of the Senate. This Supreme Court seat rightfully belongs to Merrick Garland. He deserves a fair confirmation hearing before Republicans are ever able to nominate someone to the Supreme Court again. Until then, Republican nominees should be the same and worse than the way Republicans treated Merrick Garland.And Republicans only have themselves to blame.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"April 2, 2017"

12125,"OBAMA BLAMES RUSSIA For Hillary’s Loss, But NEW HARVARD STUDY Exposes Who REALLY Interfered In Outcome Of Our Elections","A new report from Harvard Kennedy School s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy analyzes news coverage during the 2016 general election, and concludes that both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump received coverage that was overwhelmingly negative in tone and extremely light on policy.This is the final report of a multi-part research series analyzing news coverage of candidates and issues during the 2016 presidential election. The study tracks news coverage from the second week of August 2016 to the day before Election Day.Negative coverage was the order of the day in the general election. Not a week passed where the nominees  coverage reached into positive territory. It peaked at 81 percent negative in mid-October, but there was not a single week where it dropped below 64 percent negative.The press s negative bent is not confined to election politics (see Figure 4).[2] In recent years, when immigration has been the subject of news stories, the ratio of negative stories to positive ones has been 5-to-1. In that same period, news reports featuring Muslims have been 6-to-1 negative. News stories about health care policy, most of which centered on the 2010 Affordable Care Act, have been 2-to-1 negative. Although the nation s economy has steadily improved since the financial crisis of 2008, one would not know that from the tone of news coverage. Since 2010, news stories about the nation s economy have been 2-to-1 negative over positive.The real bias of the press is not that it s liberal. Its bias is a decided preference for the negative. As scholar Michael Robinson noted, the news media seem to have taken some motherly advice and turned it upside down.  If you don t have anything bad to say about someone, don t say anything at all. [3] A New York Times columnist recently asserted that  the internet is distorting our collective grasp on the truth. [4] There s a degree of accuracy in that claim but the problem goes beyond the internet and the talk shows. The mainstream press highlights what s wrong with politics without also telling us what s right.It s a version of politics that rewards a particular brand of politics. When everything and everybody is portrayed as deeply flawed, there s no sense making distinctions on that score, which works to the advantage of those who are more deeply flawed. Civility and sound proposals are no longer the stuff of headlines, which instead give voice to those who are skilled in the art of destruction. The car wreck that was the 2016 election had many drivers. Journalists were not alone in the car, but their fingerprints were all over the wheel.The research is confined to the election coverage in the print editions of five daily papers (the Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, and USA Today) and the main newscasts of five television networks (ABC World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, CNN s The Situation Room, Fox s Special Report, and NBC Nightly News). In the case of the newspapers, the analysis covers all sections except sports, obituaries, and letters to the editor. Op-eds and editorials are included, but letters from the public are not. For television, the analysis covers the full daily content of each network s major newscast. Network talk shows are not included.Trump s general election news coverage fit the pattern of earlier stages of the campaign in several respects but not all. The major departure was that his general election coverage was overwhelmingly negative in tone. In our earlier reports, we documented the positive coverage Trump received during the nominating stage of the campaign, a pattern largely attributable to the press s tendency to highlight the horserace in the pre-primary and primary periods. As Trump rose from single digits in the polls and then won key primaries, he got favorable press. It was a story of growing momentum, rising poll numbers, ever larger crowds, and electoral success. The fact that the horse race is the most heavily covered aspect of the nominating phase magnified Trump s favorable coverage.Trump s general election coverage was a stark contrast. His coverage was negative from the start, and never came close to entering positive territory (see Figure 8).  During his best weeks, the coverage ran 2-to-1 negative over positive. In his worst weeks, the ratio was more than 10-to-1. If there was a silver lining for Trump, it was that his two best weeks were the ones just preceding the November balloting. Trump s coverage was negative in all the news outlets in our study, even those that typically side with the Republican nominee (see Figure 9). Fox provided Trump his most favorable coverage, but it was still nearly 3-to-1 negative over positive. The Wall Street Journal was his next best outlet, but its coverage ran 4-to-1 negative. The most negative coverage was carried by CBS at 9-to-1, but Trump s coverage was nearly as negative in most other outlets.Compare to Hillary s coverage:To be sure, changes in journalism are not the only reason that campaigns have become more negative. The party polarization that has seeped into American politics during the past three decades has been accompanied by rising levels of partisan attack. But to claim that party polarization explains the media s negative bent is to ignore the fact that the press s negativity is not confined to party politics. There s barely an aspect of public life that is not subject to intense criticism.A healthy dose of negativity is unquestionably a good thing. There s a lot of political puffery, ineptitude, and manipulation that needs to be exposed, and journalists would be shirking their duty if they failed to expose it. Yet an incessant stream of criticism has a corrosive effect. It needlessly erodes trust in political leaders and institutions and undermines confidence in government and policy.Negative news has partisan consequences. Given that journalists bash both sides, it might be thought the impact would be neutral. It s not. For one thing, indiscriminate criticism has the effect of blurring important distinctions. Were the allegations surrounding Clinton of the same order of magnitude as those surrounding Trump? It s a question that journalists made no serious effort to answer during the 2016 campaign. They reported all the ugly stuff they could find, and left it to the voters to decide what to make of it. Large numbers of voters concluded that the candidates  indiscretions were equally disqualifying and made their choice, not on the candidates  fitness for office, but on less tangible criteria in some cases out of a belief that wildly unrealistic promises could actually be kept.For entire story and study: Harvard Kennedy School Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy",politics,"Dec 16, 2016"
16424,RED FLAG IN CLINTON’S FBI INTERVIEW Shocks Former Prosecutor Andrew McCarthy,"Finally, something else about those lawyers. I nearly fell out of my chair upon reading the very first paragraph of the notes of Clinton s interview, which identifies the lawyers for Clinton who were permitted to be present for the interview. Among them is Cheryl Mills, Clinton s longtime confidant and chief-of-staff at the State Department.Readers may recall that I suggested back in May that  the fix  was in in the investigation of the Clinton emails. The reason was that the Justice Department was allowing Cheryl Mills   a witness, if not a subject, of the investigation   to invoke attorney-client privilege on behalf of Mrs. Clinton in order to thwart the FBI s attempt to inquire into the procedure used to produce Clinton s emails to the State Department. Mills was a participant in that procedure   and it is the procedure in which, we now know, well over 30,000 emails were attempted to be destroyed, including several thousand that contained government-related business.When she worked for Clinton at State, Mills was not acting in the capacity of a lawyer   not for then-Secretary Clinton and not for the State Department. Moreover, as Clinton s chief-of-staff, Mills was intimately involved in issues related to Clinton s private email set up, the discussions about getting her a secure BlackBerry similar to President Obama s, and questions that were raised (including in FOIA requests) about Clinton s communications.That is to say, Mills was an actor in the facts that were under criminal investigation by the FBI. Put aside that she was not Mrs. Clinton s lawyer while working for the State Department; as I explained in the May column, Mills, after leaving the State Department, was barred by ethical rules from acting as Mrs. Clinton s lawyer  in connection with a matter in which the lawyer participated personally and substantially as a public officer or employee. There is no way Mills should have been permitted to participate as a lawyer in the process of producing Clinton s emails to the State Department nearly two years after they d both left.I thought it was astonishing that the Justice Department indulged her attorney-client privilege claim, which frustrated the FBI s ability to question her on a key aspect of the investigation. But it is simply unbelievable to find her turning up at Mrs. Clinton s interview   participating in the capacity of a lawyer under circumstances where Clinton was being investigated over matters in which Mills participated as a non-lawyer government official.FLASHBACK: REMEMBER WHEN CHERYL MILLS WALKED OUT OF FBI MEETING: Read more: NRO",Government News,"Sep 3, 2016"
14144,LOBBYING FOR VOTES? How Trump Could LEGALLY Fly The 200 Must Have Delegates To Mar-a-Lago For A Luxurious Weekend,"It may be legal to lobby delegates, but will Donald Trump use his luxurious properties to woo delegates leading up to the Republican Convention in July? And if other candidates before him have used the same tactics, should Donald Trump be criticized because his success allows him to offer more 5-star perks?West Virginia looks perfect for Donald Trump: a struggling working-class state filled with the types of voters who have backed him elsewhere and could deliver one of his biggest victories.But a sweep there might not matter. That s because as many as 34 delegates   the entire contingent   may be free to back whomever they want at the Republican National Convention.Much the same is true in Pennsylvania, home to a hotly contested April 26 primary, where there are 54 uncommitted delegates. Other states and territories, from Colorado to Wyoming to Guam, will also send squads of unbound representatives.These are the swing voters of the GOP nominating contest, nearly 200 activists and elected leaders beholden to nothing except their personal judgment and empowered to make or break candidacies.If Trump arrives at the July convention in Cleveland just shy of the 1,237 delegates required to secure the nomination outright, these unbound delegates could decide to push him over the top   or force a contested convention with successive rounds of balloting. It s the wildcatter of delegate selection,  said Ed Brookover, a senior adviser to Trump, who drew an analogy to risk-taking oilmen who drill in unexplored land.The three remaining candidates are identifying these delegates, researching their proclivities and beginning to cajole them. The law surrounding them is so unclear that Trump could conceivably fly them to Florida for a weekend of luxuriating at Mar-a-Lago, his gold-adorned and palm-lined private club   where, naturally, they could be subjected to personal lobbying to support Trump.Brookover did not rule out the Trump campaign entertaining delegates at one of Trump s properties or paying for their travel costs to Cleveland. But he added:  You certainly can t offer anything which would be considered a bribe. We can t give them $100,000. Charlie Black, who is helping lead Ohio Gov. John Kasich s delegate strategy, recalled working on Ronald Reagan s insurgent campaign in 1976 and struggling to court delegates as industriously as then-President Gerald Ford. People got to stay at the White House, fly on Air Force One and meet Queen Elizabeth,  Black said.Federal rules do not provide clear guidance about whether delegates can accept items of value from a campaign, other than reimbursement for their travel expenses. Campaign finance lawyers are divided over whether federal or state anti-bribery statutes would apply to delegates who are not elected officials   and if so, what kinds of perks or inducements could be illegal.For entire story: Washington Post",politics,"Apr 9, 2016"
6678, Colbert Outs Republicans As The True Weirdos For Obsessing Over Who Goes To The Bathroom (VIDEO),"Late Show host Stephen Colbert hilariously took aim at bathroom obsessed Republicans on Tuesday night and hit the bulls-eye.Colbert began by talking about how anti-LGBT conservatives have organized a boycott of Target because the company unveiled a policy in which transgender people can use the bathroom corresponding to their gender identity. And then he told the audience where he stands on the issue. Here s the thing. I don t care if you re male or female, what sex or gender identity someone is, I   and I mean this sincerely   do not want to share a bathroom with anyone. For two reasons: No. 1   and No. 2,  Colbert began.Unlike Republicans, Colbert says when he goes into the restroom he has no desire to look at everyone s genitalia to ascertain whether they are transgender or not. When I am forced to use a public bathroom   which is infrequently, thank God   I go in there with blinders on. I don t know who s next to me. It could be a centaur next to me, for all I know. I don t even like to look at myself in the mirror afterwards. I know what I did. I m there for a surgical strike   get in, get out, minimal casualties. Colbert doesn t even care if a famous celebrity or a fan is standing next to him. He simply wants to do his business with no chit-chat and get the hell out. I m not there to make friends. If we ve just come out of a movie and you re standing next to me, I don t want to talk about how irreplaceable Robert Downey Jr. is as Iron Man. I don t care if you re Robert Downey Jr. yourself. Second, if you re a fan of mine   that s wonderful,  he continued.  Please don t try to shake my hand in there. Because I know what you just shook. Also, if there are a bunch of open stalls, don t take the one next to me. It s not the buddy system. With that being said, Colbert concluded that Republicans are the real weirdos for obsessing so much over who is using the bathroom and what their genitalia is. To all those lawmakers out there who are so obsessed with who s using what bathroom and what plumbing they ve got downtown   newsflash: You re the weirdos. Here s the video via YouTube.Colbert is absolutely right, of course.Republicans are not only obsessed with gay people having sex, they are obsessed with who is using the bathroom. In fact, they actually expect people to inspect the genitalia of other bathroom users and report them to authorities.Kansas Republicans recently introduced a pair of bills granting students $2,500 every time they see and report a transgender student using the bathroom, which means they would actually have to look at what each person has between their legs in order to cash-in.The fact that conservatives even thought of such bills is sickening. And considering that Republicans themselves have been arrested for misconduct in bathrooms while not a single transgender person has committed such a crime, it makes one wonder why we don t have laws banning conservatives from using public restrooms. After all, they seem to be the only ones who can t control themselves.Featured image via screenshot",News,"April 27, 2016"
8105," Alex Jones POSITIVE Obama Killed Scalia, And You’ll Never Believe Who He Thinks Is Next (VIDEO)","There s crazy and then there s nonsensical, conspiratorial, out of your head, paranoid with a tinfoil hat on your head, curled in the fetal position in your mom s basement crazy. The latter would be radio talk show host Alex Jones.Not only does he believe that President Obama somehow secretly had Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia killed, a man who was 79-years-old and a known smoker and we know died of natural causes, but now he believes that the president has plans for other people as well. You know, so Obama can finally unleash his true intentions for the nation. After all, he still hasn t come for anyone s guns or forced us all to be Muslim  yet.Jones declared in a morbid Facebook post,  this is the season of treason, this is the time of betrayal and we would be fools not to ask the question.  Which clearly begs the question, who is allowing Alex Jones to have any sort of internet privileges? He s more than lost his mind, he s replaced it with a new bag of nuts.However, he goes on: You just get used to this,  Scalia found, it s natural, nothing going on here, he just died naturally. And you re like,  Whoa. Red flag.  Then you realize, Obama is one vote away from being able to ban guns, open the borders and actually have the court engage in its agenda and now Scalia dies. I mean, this is hard core I wonder if Clarence Thomas will die of a heart attack next week. If this is an assassination, it signifies that they re dropping the hammer, that s the canary in the coal mine. Wait! There s more! Are they going to kill Clarence Thomas? Maybe they ll kill Ron Paul. Maybe they ll kill Donald Trump next. They all had heart attacks. How many more of these are we going to sit here and put up with? Or maybe their airplane blows up. Someone needs to tell this guy to relax. However, he adds: My gut tells me they killed him and all the intellectual evidence lays it out. The only thing his gut indicates is that he s had one too many cheeseburgers.He then goes on to insist that Republicans need to block anyone Obama nominates, because if they don t liberals are going to destroy the Constitution and start a civil war. He literally believes Obama is coming after everyone.Jones has said a lot of crazy things in his career, but this may take the cake. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;Breaking: Justice Scalia Murdered?Posted by Alex Jones on Saturday, February 13, 2016Featured image: screencap",News,"February 14, 2016"
3874, RIGGED: Hillary Wins Popular Vote As Republicans Claim WH Victory,"While the final vote tally won t be in for quite some time, at this point it s looking like the massive victory Republicans were granted yesterday was due largely in part to gerrymandering   perfectly legal rigging of the vote that parties take advantage of during the census. Because Republicans controlled most state legislatures during the time of the last census, Republican votes tend to count more than Democratic votes do.That s why, despite the simple fact that more people probably voted for Hillary Clinton, we are facing at least four years of a Donald Trump presidency. We actually saw exactly how this would play out in 2012, when Republicans took the House despite losing by over a million in the popular vote. Democrats simply can t afford close races.It s hard to admit, but Donald Trump was right about something   the election WAS rigged. By state and congressional Republicans, and then by obstructionists. Hopefully, this loss teaches the Democrats that stayed home and leftists that refused to unify that we can t afford to put ideology over pragmatism. When the other side is cheating, the only solution is to boost turnout beyond what they can cope with. That s really the only way to see a silver lining in any of this   maybe people will learn. The Democratic Party picked up seats in the House and Senate   enough to give the GOP a taste of  no    but the next four years are looking bleak.Here s a video that explains the process of gerrymandering and how Republicans have orchestrated it so that your vote doesn t count the way it should:Also, you should know there is an interstate compact between quite a few states   and the list is growing   that are pledging to give their electors to the winner of the popular vote the next time around. That d be a win for democracy. If we d had that in play this time around, we might not be looking at a Donald Trump presidency. And it would mean that every vote does, indeed, count   right now, unless you live in a swing state, you probably already know whether your vote counts before you cast it.Photo by John Sommers II/Getty Images",News,"November 9, 2016"
2043, BOMBSHELL: Devin Nunes’ Entire Net Worth Sunk In Company With Strong Ties To Russia,"If today s fiasco, which came courtesy of House Intel chair Devin Nunes, wasn t enough to convince anyone that he can t conduct a credible investigation into whether or not Trump and his teams colluded with Russia, then this should be: Nunes has put almost his entire net worth into a winery with strong ties to Russia.How strong? Well, the Alpha Omega Winery has distributors all over the U.S., but just a few abroad. One of those overseas distributors is the Luding Trading Company in Russia. Luding is, in fact, Russia s largest distributor for alcoholic beverages. But they don t just operate in Russia   they also appear to have a relationship with Vladimir Putin: The Luding Company and the Yerevan Ararat Brandy-Wine-Vodka factory sent greetings to Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, on his 55th birthday and made a birthday present of bottles of the Noy, the Sovereign 55 cognac and the Vanatur and Varpet unique 1952 vintage wines, 1952 being the President s birth year. If Russia were truly a free, democratic state, then maybe this could be overlooked as nothing more than a large company wishing the leader of a country that had given them so much a happy birthday. But Russia, under Putin, is anything but truly free. With Luding being the country s largest distributor of alcohol, it s highly unlikely that Putin doesn t have his fingers in it somewhere. The fact that Nunes has his money sunk there is a pretty big deal.It s also odd that Alpha Omega Winery would have a relationship with Russia s largest distributor when they only have a relationship with one Western nation (Switzerland). They don t have any relationships with any other distributor in the EU, which means no relationships with NATO allies at all.Then there s the fact that Nunes is one of the people Trump called upon to refute news about the whole Russia scandal. That right there compromised the House s investigation into Trump and Russia because it blurs the lines between the intelligence community, the White House, and Congress.And Nunes actually did what Trump asked him to   he started sending messages to reporters challenging the Russia stories. As the chairman of the committee investigating the Trump-Russia tie, he should never have done that.It appears more and more likely that Nunes was never acting independently in this investigation. And given that he s got business ties to Russia tenuous or not he should have recused himself from this investigation the instant it got underway.Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images",News,"March 22, 2017"
4845," Newt Gingrich Attempted To Stiff Small Businesses, FEC Shot Him Down","Newt Gingrich, former House Speaker and now Trump-surrogate, apparently pulled a page out of the Republican presidential nominee s playbook when he attempted to stiff over 144 businesses (including dozens of small businesses) who helped him with his 2012 failed presidential campaign.Gingrich, who owes over $4 million in campaign debt, recently filed documents with the Federal Elections Commission to effectively detail a debt settlement that would end his presidential election committee, thus allowing him to escape paying the millions back to creditors and consultants who helped his campaign.Many of these small businesses manufactured lawn signs and organized TV spots for the Republican candidate, who four years later would be runner-up on Donald Trump s V.P. slot.Luckily the FEC wasn t having any of it rejected Gingrich s debt settlement, saying that his plan does not  meet the requirement  under federal election law because it  contains no debt settlement agreements and must continue to file all required reports.  So instead of the FEC taking action right now, Gingrich will have to complete the entire process of debt settlement plan procedures.Gingrich, who is worth anywhere between $7 to $30 million, has some nerve stiffing small business owners when they poured their resources into his failed presidential campaign. Perhaps this is why Trump didn t pick him: they both have gotten flak for stiffing honest, hardworking business owners.It s time Republicans take responsibility for their actions and pay their debts. While busy running small businesses into the ground, they have the gall to stand up on stages and podiums and proclaim to be saviors of small businesses.So many people have been hurt at the hands of Republicans, it s hard to keep track. But this election has shown the American people one thing: Republicans do not pay back their debts, and they will crush anyone to save a buck.Hopefully, the FEC denied Gingrich again and forces him to pay back his debts to those who helped him. If he were an honest conservative (fiscal responsibility?), this wouldn t even be an issue in the first place.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images",News,"August 30, 2016"
5627, Karma In All Its Glory: Republican Chairwoman Forced To Resign Over ‘Obama Is A Chimp’ Facebook Post,"A little over a month ago, Linda Sorenson, the Republican Chair for Delta County, Colorado, posted the following Facebook meme:Oh those wacky Republicans and their unbelievable racism!At first, Sorenson was defiant in the face of public condemnation, stating, I really don t care if people are offended by it,  she told me of the post, which was sent to me by a source.  Un-friend me. Stop looking at me on Facebook.  After all, this is a new day in America. This is Donald Trump s America and gosh darn it! White people won t stand for being oppressed by the PC Police any longer! Let freedumb ring!But a funny thing about Trump s America it doesn t actually exist. At least not yet. And certainly not in the very purple state of Colorado. Clearly, Sorenson thought the people would rally to her bigoted side. Instead, according to the The Daily Sentinel:That posting not only prompted calls of her resignation from fellow Delta County Republicans, but also from several outside groups, including the Colorado branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Greater Metro Denver Ministerial Alliance.Whoops.In the face of all of this pressure, Sorenson changed her story from,  I m racist and I m proud!  to the perennial favorite of politicians who make a social media blunder:  Someone hacked my account! I m the victim here! After four  accountability meetings  though, including an investigation into Sorenson violating party rules by endorsing a local Republican primary candidate, Sorenson saw the writing on the Facebook wall and resigned. The Republicans Central Committee was quick to distance themselves:Suppes, who is not a member of the central committee, said it was an appropriate move. There s no room for racism, intended or unintended, in society,  he said.  It s best for the party, best for the county, that she step down. On the one hand, bravo to the Colorado GOP for dealing with this appropriately. On the other, Sorenson is hardly an outlier. Republicans have spent decades turning their party into a haven for racism and bigotry in all its many forms. Sorenson was simply stupid enough to say it out loud; a trend that has been exacerbated, but certainly not started, by Donald Trump.I wonder who she ll blame for her downfall? I m going to guess Obama. What do you think?Featured image via screencap",News,"July 3, 2016"

11921,DRAIN OBAMA’S RADICAL SWAMP! Rep Chaffetz Calls Out OBAMA APPOINTED Fed Gov Ethics Director Over UNETHICAL Public Criticisms Of Trump,"IT S TIME TO DRAIN OBAMA S SWAMP! Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the head of the House Oversight Committee, criticized the director of the federal Office of Government Ethics on Thursday over his criticism of Donald Trump s plan to address conflicts of interest. And he threatened to subpoena the official, Walter Shaub, if he refuses to participate in an official interview. He seems to be acting prematurely at best, without doing investigations or thorough looks,  Chaffetz said in an interview.  He s rendering opinions publicly that really cause you to scratch your head. We need the Office of Government Ethics to act ethically. Ironically, that s not what they re doing. Shaub, an appointee of President Barack Obama, has been a frequent critics of the incoming administration s ethics plans, peaking Wednesday when he called Trump s newly unveiled conflicts of interest policy  meaningless. The public rebuke of Trump s business arrangements came during a press conference at the Brookings Institution that included the outspoken former White House ethics lawyers for Obama and former President George W. Bush. In his remarks, Shaub said the president-elect  stepping back from running his positions is meaningless from a conflict of interest perspective. The plan does not comport with the tradition of our presidents over the last 40 years,  he added.Chaffetz said Shaub has refused since the election to agree to a meeting to discuss matters related to OGE s public remarks about Trump, as well as the Republican-led panel s plans to pass language reauthorizing the office. If Shaub continues to resist, Chaffetz said he d issue a subpoena  if we have to. He is coming in. This is not going to be an optional exercise,  Chaffetz said, adding that he expected a meeting within a few weeks.Shaub s 5-year term expires in January 2018. We need a fair person behind the plate that s going to call balls and strikes,  Chaffetz said.  What they re supposed to do is help work with somebody to comply with the ethics requirements. But when you talk publicly about private conversations, that s not ethical. And when you refuse to come in and talk to the committee when you re doing reauthorization, when you start tweeting and issuing press statements on things you never looked at, that shouldn t be the case at all. This isn t Chaffetz s first time challenging Shaub. In late 2015, the Republican accused the Obama appointee of giving Hillary Clinton a pass on conflict-of-interest laws over speaking fees she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, were supposed to disclose. But Chaffetz said he s grown more frustrated with Shaub since the November election and also singled out the OGE s use of its official Twitter account to issue a bizarre series of posts   in Trump s own staccato style   congratulating the president-elect for making major changes to his business arrangements.For entire story: POLITICO ",politics,"Jan 13, 2017"

2290, Saturday Night Live Takes On GOP Cowardice In Stunningly Accurate Faux Movie Trailer (VIDEO),"As we all live in the nightmarish hellscape that is the Donald Trump presidency is the fact that Congressional Republicans are flat-out refusing to stand up to Donald Trump s insanity. They know he is mentally unstable, corrupt, incompetent, and dangerous. However, they also are drunk with power while holding every branch of government.

Then, it moves to different scenarios of one brave Republican member of Congress speaking out against the president. In each segment, that person s identity and statements against Trump are  TBD.

22546,Who’s Better: “Dangerous Donald” or “Crooked Hillary”?,"21st Century Wire says Now that the Democratic Party establishment has finally put all its cards on the table and declared Hillary Clinton their  presumptive  nominee for President, the public at large is finally coming to grips with the prospect of a Trump vs Clinton election race come November. Rather than asking who is best fit to hold the highest office in the land, most pundits are instead asking the other question now: who is worse?To be absolutely fair, both of these personalities have their annoying and often infuriating attributes.There is one marked difference between these two political animals. While Trump is an unknown quantity in terms of politics and public service, Madame Secretary has a track record already, but not a great one.As the old adage goes   no matter who you vote for, the government always gets in  Thus far, we can say this much about Donald: he is consistent in that he will consistently make brash, off-the-cuff, shallow, offensive and often completely insane remarks on the campaign trail   remarks that should kill his opinion polls and finish his presidential run once and for all. Somehow though, he survives, and even thrives in the controversy. Most experts are still  speechless  for comment.As Secretary of State Hillary Clinton fronted at least one major war of aggression with the decapitation of the nation state of Libya in 2011. Since the US-led take-down of that country, things have gone from very bad to beyond the pale. Few will remember though, that Hillary Clinton was also fronting the US-UK-led  Friends of Syria  (2011-2012) Middle East & European regime change road show   where western leaders colluded with Gulf Kings and oil magnates to discuss the take-down and destruction of Syria.Regarding Israel, Clinton s record is completely pro-Israel with no caveats. She does not call for end to occupation of Palestine by Israel, nor will she publicly recognize the native Palestinians  collective right of self-determination, or their refugees right of return. She is also anti-Iran and will happily give succour to any and every Israeli desire on that issue.On the other hand, Donald Trump has made numerous public declarations including one on national TV about his intention to broker a peace deal between the Israelis and the native Palestinians.Does this mean Hillary will be worse than Donald? Not necessarily, because Washington has a way of grinding every political operator down to the same reprehensible level it seems.What it does mean is that with Hillary you know what you are getting, while with Donald, you don t.For those leaning towards Clinton in this Hobsons Choice simulation, this means the next default position is: better the devil you know.Once again, Americans seem forced into that tired old electoral clich , forced to choose between  the lesser of two evils (leave your thoughts and comments below)Marc Joffe Fiscal TimesIn 1991, Louisiana voters faced a difficult choice. In the runoff gubernatorial election that fall, the candidates were Democrat Edwin Edwards and Republican David Duke. The notoriously corrupt Edwards had already served three terms as governor and faced bribery charges. (When it turned out, after Edwards was acquitted in that case, that some of the sequestered jurors had stolen towels from their hotel, Edwards reportedly quipped that he had been judged by a  jury of my peers. ) Edwards would later be convicted on 17 counts of racketeering, extortion, money laundering and fraud.Duke s story was even worse; he was a former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and was still active in white supremacist circles. Mainstream Republicans lined up behind Edwards. In the heat of the campaign, which Edwards went on to win, it became common to see bumper stickers that read,  Vote for the Crook. It s Important. Maybe somebody should print up another batch of those stickers for the presidential race this year. With Hillary Clinton assured of surpassing the 2383 delegate nomination threshold today, Democrats have chosen an apparently corrupt candidate to be their presumptive nominee. She s still the better choice for president.Related: How Conservatives Stopped Listening and Lost Control of the GOPCircumstantial evidence of Clinton s corruption is abundant and easily found by anyone not in denial. Although she is not responsible for her husband s infidelity nor for Vince Foster s suicide, other scandals are not so easily dismissed. As the recent State Department Investigator General s report suggests, Clinton set up a home-brew email server in contravention of department policies to prevent disclosure of her correspondence. The IG report also confirms that, even today, Clinton has not turned over all the messages that passed through her personal server.Some of the missing messages may have documented the inappropriate links between her job as secretary of state and her involvement with the Clinton Foundation. As documented by Peter Schweizer in Clinton Cash, State Department project approvals sometimes coincided with large contributions to the foundation by beneficiaries of these actions. After leaving office, Clinton continued to sell her influence to the highest bidder, as evidenced by the $225,000 speaking fees she received from Goldman Sachs.Clinton s pay-for-play activity has a long history   going back at least to the late 1970s. As I previously wrote, Clinton effectively received a $98,000 bribe from interests related to Tyson Foods via a sham futures trading account. Her husband s Arkansas gubernatorial administration then eased oversight of Tyson, allowing it to contaminate one town s water supply with chicken manure.Related: Most Americans Don t Believe Hillary Clinton and Donald TrumpIn 1992, the cozy relationship between Bill Clinton s Arkansas state house, Hillary s Rose Law Firm and regulated entities was detailed by The Washington Post and raised by former California Gov. Jerry Brown during a presidential debate. Under Bill Clinton s administration, Arkansas issued multiple no-bid contracts to the Rose Law Firm, assigned it up $175,000 in bond counsel work and authorized Madison Guaranty Bank   a failing Savings and Loan Association represented by Hillary   to issue preferred stock.When political leaders fail to play by the rules applied to normal people, a natural reaction is to try and stop them. But, in this case, stopping Hillary Clinton means supporting someone else for president. And for those who think voting for a third party candidate is a waste, that leaves only one alternative:  Donald Trump.So rather than immediately dismissing Hillary for her ethical flaws, the correct approach is to determine whether she is better than the alternative. I tend to think the answer is yes.A useful way to look at the decision this November is to ask whether continuity or change is the better option for the U.S. at this point in time. Clinton is likely to continue most Obama-era policies, whereas Trump can be expected to attempt some radical departures.Related: Can Trump s Nationalist Trade Policy Really Make America Great Again?Complaints about the status quo notwithstanding, life in 2016 America isn t horrible for most of us, and so radical change comes with a lot of downside risk. Although some of the doom and gloom predictions about a Trump administration are overstated (for example, I would not expect white supremacists to play a major role in his administration), there are legitimate causes for concern.A major threat posed by Trump is the potential for a breakdown in global cooperation. Trump seems to view foreign countries like competing companies or candidates, failing to appreciate the interdependence that characterizes our global order. Trumpian brinkmanship could trigger a global trade war, repeating the error of the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff. When Herbert Hoover signed that piece of protectionist legislation, the result was a cascade of beggar thy neighbor reactions from U.S. trading partners, greatly exacerbating the Great Depression.Trump s policies toward illegal immigrants would also be destabilizing. Millions of undocumented aliens take service and agricultural jobs that American citizens avoid. If these individuals are rounded up or  self deport  in large numbers, industries that rely on them could be crippled.

5719, WATCH: Chuck Todd Reveals More Evidence Trump’s Campaign Is A Money Making Scheme,"On Sunday, Meet the Press host Chuck Todd revealed more specifics that help make the case that Donald Trump is raking in big money from his campaign   or at least his businesses are.During the segment, Todd explains that since much of Trump s lavish campaign spending is being spent buying products his and his family s businesses make, or at properties they own, Trump s found a legal way to funnel campaign contributions back into his private business. Rachael Maddow first made the case that Trump s campaign was a money making scheme earlier this week. Now, Todd is making a very similar case, while providing even more examples of Trump s campaign spending. Todd explained: We ll start with Eric Trump s businesses. The Trump campaign paid nearly $5,000 to Eric Trump Wine Manufacturing. It spent over $91,000 to rent out three different Trump golf clubs in Florida for events. $136,000 to Trump restaurants including Trump Grill and Trump Cafe in Trump Tower. Over $420,000 to rent Trump s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. That also doubles as his vacation home.There s been more than $430,000 of Trump campaign money spent on rent at the Trump Tower. Of course, it s his Fifth Avenue skyscraper that does double as Trump s campaign headquarters.And the biggest expense of all has been $4.6 million the campaign has paid to Tag Air, which is the name of Trump s private airline.All told, the campaign has spent over $6 million at Trump-owned businesses out of about $63 million spent through the end of May.So 10 percent of all campaign spending has gone back to Trump or Trump affiliated businesses. Again, none of what Trump is doing is illegal. Todd also points out that while the world was reacting to Brexit, Trump flew to Scotland to promote his new golf course there   hardly offering more than a few idiotic sentiments on one of the biggest political shocks of the 21st century. That s not something a true presidential candidate would do. Combined with his campaign s lack of direction and well, a complete lack of campaigning the past month, evidence is quickly piling up that Trump s campaign has never been about anything other than publicity, while making him and his family a ton of money at the same time.You can watch the segment below.Featured image from video screenshot",News,"June 26, 2016"

4165, Republican Mailer Threatens To Out Voters To Neighbors If They Vote Democrat,"New Mexico Republicans are resorting to intimidation tactics to scare voters into voting for Donald Trump.The Republican Party is literally sending out flyers to people across the state warning them that if they don t vote GOP on Election Day they will tattle on them to their neighbors and make life more difficult for them.According to the Daily Beast,The mailer shows a woman in a cold blue hue peeking through her blinds.  When the Democrats win the election and you didn t do your part  your neighbors will know,  it reads, in all caps.The back shows a map of houses, some tagged with red check marks in blue pinpoints. Do your part in this election,  it says.  After all, voting is a matter of public record. While whether you voted or not is a matter of public record, who or what party you voted for is not. Obtaining and using such information to threaten voters is election fraud and voter intimidation, both of which are federal crimes.18 U.S, Code 594 states,Whoever intimidates, threatens, coerces, or attempts to intimidate, threaten, or coerce, any other person for the purpose of interfering with the right of such other person to vote or to vote as he may choose  shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.And a spokesman for the New Mexico GOP admitted that the party sent out the flyer, thus admitting to committing a crime. But when further questioned about the flyer, W. Tucker Keene hung up on the The Daily Beast.While Donald Trump and his deplorable supporters continue to cry about election fraud, their own party is committing that very crime in New Mexico. The question is do they have a problem with that or do they only care about non-existent election fraud that Democrats are supposedly going to commit?Because not having a problem with real election fraud just because it is perpetrated by Republicans would make them hypocrites.By outing people who vote Democrat, the New Mexico GOP would be putting Americans in danger of being persecuted or worse just because they voted a certain way.Sending out a mailer with the intent to intimidate voters is illegal and the New Mexico GOP should be under investigation by the Department of Justice. This is an outrageous dirty tactic and there needs to be serious consequences.Featured Image: Daily Beast ",News,"October 16, 2016"

7290," After Sex Scandal Allegations, Ted Cruz Unleashes Colossally Pathetic Hissy Fit On Facebook","In the world of politics there are going to be scandals. It s just a fact. There s no way around it. They can be true or they can be false, but they are going to happen no matter who you are. What s important, however, is how one handles the scandals, and so far Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz has shown that he can t handle much of anything thrown his way.With The National Enquirer printing a story that alleges Cruz s involved with five different women other than his wife, #CruzSexScandal quickly started to take over social media and the national conversation. Is the story true? Who knows, really. But at this point it doesn t really matter, because it s out there.Now, Cruz could simply shrug off these allegations, or even laugh at them for how ridiculous they may be, but instead he chose to throw a ginormous hissy fit on Facebook and blames the entire thing on Donald Trump. And who knows, maybe Trump is to blame. However, how Cruz is handling all of this shows how he may handle times of trouble, and let s just say, it ain t pretty.Cruz wrote on Facebook: I want to be crystal clear: these attacks are garbage. For Donald J. Trump to enlist his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen to do his bidding shows you that there is no low Donald won t go.These smears are completely false, they re offensive to Heidi and me, they re offensive to our daughters, and they re offensive to everyone Donald continues to personally attack.Donald Trump s consistently disgraceful behavior is beneath the office we are seeking and we are not going to follow. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;I want to be crystal clear: these attacks are garbage.

8240," Stephen Colbert And His Audience Absolutely Pummeled Bill O’Reilly, And It Was Spectacular (VIDEO)","When appearing on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert it s probably best to expect the unexpected. And in the case for Fox News host Bill O Reilly, it was probably best to expect his far right-wing humor to not be appreciated whatsoever by either Colbert or his audience.Within the first few moments of his appearance, he alienated pretty much everyone by saying those over on CNN and MSNBC are  on crack.  He was trying to convince people that Fox News is #1 in the ratings for a reason. Little does he realize that if people want their right-wing hate TV, they only have one place to go, whereas facts are dispersed everywhere else. So when O Reilly made his remark about the other networks, the crowd audibly booed him and was not impressed whatsoever.Then, just moments later, O Reilly thought it wise to do a Bernie Sanders impersonation while also saying that Sanders and Trump are the same person. Here s the thing: Colbert and his audience, are likely going to have a liberal response, so you can only guess how this Sanders bashing was received   not well. Colbert even asking the Fox News host after his Sanders impression,  are you having a stroke? After a huge back and forth about what O Reilly deems best for the nation, and when Colbert explains what actually is best for the nation, they end their debate cordially, but it was obvious the Late Show host was visibly annoyed with the Fox News toady.Colbert ended the interview with this amazing statement: You re a great model to do an impression of for ten years.

19343,DECLASSIFIED US INTEL REPORT Used To Discredit Trump Is Huge Embarrassment…Evidence Was Compiled In 2012 After OBAMA’S Reelection,"A highly-anticipated declassified US intelligence report, aimed to prove that Russia supported Donald Trump, has turned out to be a huge embarrassment. The annex that contained factual material that was thought to provide evidence of RT influencing the American public was compiled in December 2012, right after the reelection of Barack Obama.The report focuses on television shows and interviews that took place four years before Trump was elected, and well before he was even a politician. In Annex A of the report, intelligence agencies claim that  Kremlin s TV Seeks To Influence Politics, Fuel Discontent in US.  Buried at the bottom of that page is a note stating,  This annex was originally published on 11 December 2012 by the Open Source Center, now the Open Source Enterprise. The report notes that two RT shows, Breaking the Set and Truthseeker, focused on criticism of US. The problem is, both of these shows were off air before the 2016 election season began.The report goes on to detail programming in 2012 about voting booth irregularities, which, again, would have been during Obama s campaign. Despite being an old report, the topic became largely relevant once again during the Democratic primaries when voters found themselves purged from voting rolls, and hundreds of thousands of ballots went uncounted.Perhaps most shocking of all, the dastardly RT network dared to host third party debates, as they were not allowed participation in the main debates.  In an effort to highlight the alleged  lack of democracy  in the United States, RT broadcast, hosted, and advertised third party candidate debates and ran reporting supportive of the political agenda of these candidates. The RT hosts asserted that the US two-party system does not represent the views of at least one-third of the population and is a sham.  Apparently, the intelligence communities do not agree that some of the people they serve may not fit perfectly into the two neat and tidy political boxes of Republicans and Democrats. The report states that the network aired a documentary on Occupy Wall Street, an obviously left-wing movement, in 2012. Again, this was the year Obama was elected, so perhaps the Russians actually won HIM the presidency. They presented evidence that Russian media often reports on infringements of civil liberties, police brutality, and drone use. While these issues are all popular topics of discussion in left-leaning media, RT s reporting in 2012 was clearly part of a long-running plot to elect Trump, right?If the report is true and RT the Almighty was swinging votes in 2012, the only beneficiary of the coverage was the now-outgoing president of the United States, who won a landslide victory over Republican Mitt Romney. Four years ago Trump was not thought of as a politician and it remains a mystery how RT s 2012 coverage could propel him. A mystery, that even a classified version of the report would have a hard time explaining.    Sputnik news ",left-news,"Jan 7, 2017"

Bush in 1990. Its primary purpose was to increase diversity in America. Has everyone had enough  diversity  yet?Clockwise, Hanad Mustafe Musse, 19, Guled Omar, 20, Zacharia Yusuf Adurahman, 19, and Adnan Abdihamid Farah, 19. They are four of six Minnesota Muslims that have been charged with traveling or attempting to travel to Syria to join the Islamic State.Using college loans. Out. of control. Obama s jihad immigration policies now have us funding our own demise. Where is the oversight? Where is the outrage?Described as good students, hard workers, all had plenty of connections to community. Some of the young men got a head start on racking up college credits in high school. Some juggled college and jobs that helped them chip in for family budgets. Some worshiped NBA stars and caught college-night games at Target Center. Hmmmm, what went wrong?Sherburne County Sheriff s Office, via Associated Press Hanad Mustafe Musse, 19.Two Twin Cities men charged with conspiracy to fight alongside terrorists now face financial fraud charges for allegedly using their college loans to purchase airline tickets to fly to the Middle East.In a superseding indictment unsealed Tuesday by the U.S. attorney s office in Minnesota, Hamza Ahmed and Hanad Mustafe Musse were charged with using more than $1,000 of financial aid provided to them.Ahmed, 20, of Savage, and Musse, 19, of Minneapolis, are among seven young Somali-Americans from Minnesota who face charges of planning to leave the United States and fight alongside Islamic extremist groups. Six of them were charged in April.During the past two years, more than 20 Somali-Americans from Minnesota have left to fight alongside terrorists with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL, according to the FBI.The new indictment says that Ahmed and Musse bought airline tickets on Nov. 8, 2014, from New York s John F. Kennedy Airport to Europe, using more than $1,000 in federal college financial aid. Ahmed used his aid money to purchase a flight to Istanbul, Turkey, authorities say. Musse used similar funds to buy a ticket to travel to Greece. From those two destinations, authorities say the pair then planned on heading to Syria. Ahmed had actually boarded his flight when he was ordered off the plane by officers from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.In a related matter, Abdirahman Daud, 21, another alleged conspirator, made his first appearance in federal court in Minneapolis on Tuesday morning before U.S. Chief District Judge Michael Davis. Daud was arrested by the FBI in San Diego in late April, along with alleged conspirator Mohamed Farah, after they drove from Minneapolis to California. They were accompanied on the trip by a confidential informant who was working for the FBI.Daud and Farah allegedly planned to acquire false documents in San Diego in order to cross into Mexico. From there, they planned on flying to the Middle East with the intent of entering Syria to fight, authorities say.Daud, who is charged with providing material support to terrorists, is scheduled to appear for a detention hearing Friday afternoon in front of Davis. Farah is charged with conspiracy and is expected to be returned to the Twin Cities later this week. Farah s brother, Adnan, was arrested last month in connection with the case and is charged with providing support to terrorists. He is being held in the Sherburne County jail.Via: Pamela Gellar",left-news,"May 22, 2015"
866, WATCH: Anderson Cooper Throws MAJOR Shade At White House Aide Over ‘Fake News’,"An interview with CNN anchor Anderson Cooper and Sebastian Gorka Wednesday night went off the rails when the White House deputy assistant started lecturing the host on  fake news.  It s remarkable really because Gorka is  fake.  Even his PhD is fake and yet, he used to insist that everyone call him  Doctor.  Still yet, the fake doctor couldn t help himself and launched into a rant against  fake news. It s laughable. Your chryon talked about a  crisis,  Gorka told Cooper in response to a suggestion that the White House was in turmoil.  I actually work in the West Wing, I work in the White House, it is absolutely nothing of the kind. The president is a steam locomotive that can t be stopped. It s just fake news. I m sad to see CNN fall to this,  Gorka said.  I know you want salacious and sensational coverage for your ratings so your corporate sponsors and owners will have more money, but that s not media, that s not reportage. It s just fake news. Okay, I m just going to ignore the insults because I don t think it really gets us anywhere,  Cooper shot back.Cooper pressed Gorka over a tweet which Trump posted on Twitter saying the media often makes up its sources, despite the fact that Trump Jr. released the email chain which confirms The New York Times  reporting.Remember, when you hear the words ""sources say"" from the Fake Media, often times those sources are made up and do not exist.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2017 I m giving you an opportunity right now to correct what the president said this morning. Because what he s alleging is that the reporting is fake and in fact, his son s own email chain shows that it s accurate. Do you deny that?  Cooper asked. No, I deny the fact that there is anything here that is untoward. Again this is an obsessive nine-month campaign,  Gorka said.An exhausted Gorka eventually said,  I thought we were going to talk about real issues, like what we re doing with our allies in France, defeating ISIS. I am going to ask you but you re not being honest, you re not being upfront,  Cooper responded. How many minutes are we in?  Gorka said. Are you a TV producer now?  Cooper fired back.  You re concerned about how many minutes we ve been talking? Do you have somewhere else to go? If you gotta go, you gotta go. You re falling into the fake news trap again,  said Gorka.  And it s sad, Anderson. You re shaking shiny objects to try to divert people, but I don t think viewers are really that easily diverted,  Cooper said. Do you know why the president s description of a witch hunt is accurate,  Gorka asked.  Because there never were witches. And there never was any collusion. It s bogus   Anderson, you re like a broken record. No, because I m not getting any answers from you,  replied Cooper. I m answering it. Every time,  said Gorka. No, you re responding,  said Cooper.  You re not actually answering because you re not actually being up front. Let s let the viewers judge,  Gorka said, who then mocked CNN s ratings. You used that line on Monday, and you know, it was sort of mildly amusing,  Cooper said.  But I think it s funny that you have enough time in the White House, which is apparently you re so busy, you re able to sit around [and] read Nielsen numbers. No, I had really good prep from my team, because the White House press team is superb,  Gorka said.  I don t deal with this stuff because I do have a day job.

The ultimate aim of Megyn Kelly Today was to challenge Live With Kelly and Ryan, which is syndicated by ABC, but the contest is not even close. In Megyn Kelly Today s first week, Live beat it by 14% among viewers and 17% in the 25-to-54 demographic. In the second week, the gap widened, with Live besting Megyn Kelly Today by 34% among viewers and 60% in the demo.We re not sure what they were thinking when they sent the wine-soaked Hoda from the Kathie Lee and Hoda show over to help make Megyn look more  normal  and approachable to her audience, but by bringing a likeable and relatable host from another (formerly) popular show on NBC, they only managed to shine a huge spotlight on Megyn Kelly s inability to connect with anyone who isn t holding a camera. By bringing Hoda Kotb over for a very awkward segment on Kelly s show, NBC managed to reinforce why nobody wants to watch the cringe-inducing host of Megyn Kelly Today.Watch:Hoda was on #MegynKellyToday this morning for no reason other than to fill time and I've never been so embarrassed. pic.twitter.com/wXUatEcPhY  Kate Aurthur (@KateAurthur) October 19, 2017",left-news,"Oct 19, 2017"
3532, Carrier Workers BLAST Trump: ‘He Lied His Ass Off’,"Donald Trump has been bragging nonstop about the Carrier deal that supposedly kept more than 1,000 jobs in the U.S., but workers at the company are calling him out for being full of it. On Tuesday, the Carrier union s president said point blank that Trump  lied his ass off  when it came to the terms of the deal.United Steelworkers 1999 President Chuck Jones said that when Trump first said that he was going to save those 1,350 at the Indiana plant, he was hopeful. As The Hill explains,  Carrier had originally planned to move the jobs to Mexico, but decided to keep 730 of the jobs in Indiana after receiving $7 million in tax breaks from the state, where Vice President-elect Mike Pence is governor. Jones, giving the billionaire con-man far more credit than he deserves, fully expected that when Trump got up in front of the cameras on Dec. 1, he would explain that 550 of those jobs weren t saved at all. But he got up there,  Jones said,  and, for whatever reason, lied his ass off. Last week, Trump couldn t stop boasting about the deal during his ridiculous celebratory rally. Now they re keeping   actually the number s over 1,100 people,  he said,  which is so great. But Jones says this is utter bullsh*t. Trump and Pence, he explains, were more than a little misleading and some of the jobs they claimed to have saved weren t ever even slated to go to Mexico in the first place. Trump and Pence, they pulled a dog and pony show on the numbers,  Jones said.  I almost threw up in my mouth. But that won t stop Trump from bragging, and it won t stop his supporters from continuing to buy his lies hook, line, and sinker every damn time. No matter how many pants-on-fire lies Trump gets caught in, they still think he actually cares about the little guy even though it is more than obvious that he couldn t care less about anybody but himself and his rich, racist buddies.Featured image via Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images",News,"December 6, 2016"

22770,Henningsen: Obama White House Colluded with Facebook to Fabricate ‘Russian Bot’ Conspiracy,"WASHINGTON DC   This week the Senate Intelligence Committee finally gave an update on its continuing investigation into whether Russia actually had anything to do with the 2016 Election. If anyone was expecting any actual evidence to be presented, they would have been sorely disappointed, again. Still, that s not going to stop Official Washington from burning though more public money to try and prove a conspiracy theory.  The issue of collusion is still open,  said committee chairman, Richard Burr of North Carolina (R).  We have more work to do as it relates to collusion, but we re developing a clearer picture of what happened. Likewise, the committee s ranking Democrat, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, admitted they had nothing, but implored Americans to  be on guard of the Russian. The Russian active measures did not end on Election Day 2016,  said Warner. He maintains that the US should adopt a  more aggressive  whole government  approach  to combat Russian influence on the vulnerable minds of unsuspecting Americans.However, yesterday 21WIRE revealed via Consortium News   that it was Senator Warner, along with the Obama White House, who colluded with Silicon Valley giant Facebook in 2016, with Warner making multiple trips to Palo Alto to pressure Facebook to produce some  evidence  that Warner and his colleagues could hold up as proof of  Russian Bots  using Facebook to interfere in the 2016 Election. As it turns out, this was fake news fabricated by Washington and its mainstream media partners.21WIRE editor Patrick Henningsen spoke to RT International yesterday about these developments, and how the US government is using their own fake news in order to shut down competition in the information sphere. By definition, that collusion between big government and corporations is classic fascism. Watch:.

As a result of his death, President Barack Obama did his job and nominated a qualified federal judge to replace Scalia on the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland.Garland was a centrist, and a completely uncontroversial nominee for the land s highest court. However, Mitch McConnell decided that his goal was to obstruct President Obama, and he and the rest of the Republicans in the Senate decided not to meet with Judge Garland, and to give him no hearing and no vote. Now that we have a new president in Donald Trump, a right-wing extremist approved by far-right activist groups like the Heritage Foundation has been nominated in one Neil Gorsuch. To that end, Democrats are taking to the streets as they have been doing since Trump s election to pressure their elected Senators to oppose Trump s pick.One Democratic Senator, Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon) has said that he will defend and keep open the Supreme Court seat that was effectively stolen from President Obama. Merkley says via Twitter:Not only is this a stolen seat, but @realDonaldTrump has nominated a far right extremist. Unacceptable. https://t.co/9bkw4QODXD pic.twitter.com/iVHDdb2Pn9  Senator Jeff Merkley (@SenJeffMerkley) February 1, 2017Part of the statement reads: This strategy of packing the court, if successful, could threaten fundamental rights in America, including workers  right to organize, women s reproductive rights, and the rights of ordinary citizens to have their voices heard in elections rather than being drowned out by the corrupting influenceof dark money from the richest Americans. If President Trump were serious about healing the divisions in America and undoing the damage wrought by Senate Republicans last year, he could have named Merrick Garland to fill this seat. Garland is a centrist jurist who is respected on both sides of the aisle. Instead, he doubled down on division by picking an ideological and extreme nominee to satisfy the far right. Senator Merkley is right. The Court should not be packed with far-right   or, for that matter, far-left- ideologues. It should be filled with thoughtful, intellectual jurists who will not let personal opinions supercede the rule of law. That means nothing to the GOP, though; they just want their anti-worker, anti-poor, anti-gay, anti-immigrant, anti-woman agenda pushed through   damage to the nation s highest court be damned.In short, Merkley is urging his Democratic colleagues in the United States Senate to stand up to Republican obstruction, to make them look as bad as possible, and to save the Court from far-right ideologues who would destroy and roll back rights for all Americans except the rich, straight, white, and male a century.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"February 1, 2017"
6844, Trump Is Now Threatening A Lawsuit Over Copyright Violation Of His Penis (IMAGE),"The artist who painted a nude portrait of Donald Trump might be landing in a bit of hot water, due to the fact that Trump is now threatening lawsuits over the artist s work.Ilma Gore, the artist who painted the famous nude portrait of Trump, has been getting threats from Trump s legal team of impending lawsuits   plus they are also issuing Digital Millenium Copyright claims against her via Facebook. Facebook has actually been conceding to the claims and they have also warned her of legal action under the same premise.Think about it. Out of the oodles and oodles of Trump pictures online, the only one he can file copyright over is one showing his wiener.This means that Trump actually is claiming copyright on his penis. Let s think about that for just about five seconds or so Special note: The size of the pixelation is in no way indicative of the size of anything it may or may not be hiding.Ms. Gore told the New York Daily News,  I don t believe I did anything wrong. It s my work and I ll stand by it no matter what. Once the image hit the internet, it went instantly viral and has gotten bids for over  100,000 after it went on display this month in London at the Maddox Gallery.As hilarious as this is, for obvious reasons, Ilma Gore has had some very serious blowback that isn t funny at all.Ms. Gore also said that since the image of the painting hit the internet, she has also been receiving many threats of rape, death threats, and had to deal with several stalkers at her home. It s typical of a Trump supporter, or even just your average Republican   when a woman does something to make you angry, threaten her with physical violence, terrorism, and death. At least Trump s supporters are an accurate depiction of the man.The portrait got a big boost in publicity due to an unexpected development during the Republican primary season. Ms. Gore painted the portrait in February, but not long after that Trump started bragging about the size of his manhood during presidential debates. You literally couldn t buy a better publicizing platform for your work than that.As I see it, Trump has two options here. He can either claim the painting is defamation by visually proving in court that it misrepresents his genitalia in some disparaging way, or he can enforce copyright by proving it s identical. So, what s it gonna be, Donald?Featured image via Ilma Gore",News,"April 17, 2016"
2806, WATCH: Conservative Activist Openly Declares That Contraception Should Be Illegal,"MSNBC host Joy Reid was SHOCKED when a conservative anti-choice activist openly stated that birth control should be banned.During a panel discussion on Saturday, Kristan Hawkins of Students for Life literally admitted that she wants a law that forces women to get pregnant if they want to have sex.The discussion began with Reid pointing out that contraception and mammogram costs will go up for women if the Affordable Care Act is repealed.Reid asked the panel if they agreed that contraception should be legal, and Hawkins not only disagreed, she spewed misinformation about two popular forms of contraception. I believe certain forms can be legal, yes,  Hawkins said.  I don t believe abortion causing contraception should be legal. When asked to specifically name a form of contraception she thinks should be outlawed, Hawkins mentioned  hormonal contraception  like IUDs.REID:  You think IUDs should be illegal? HAWKINS:  I don t think they should be legal. They put women at risk and they kill children. Except that IUDs are one of the safest forms of birth control, and they work by preventing sperm from joining with the egg.According to the Baby Center,Both types of IUDs work primarily by preventing sperm from fertilizing an egg. The copper IUD releases copper into the uterus, which works as a spermicide. The others release a form of the hormone progestin into the uterus. The progestin thickens the cervical mucus so that sperm can t reach the egg.In other words, unless conservatives now believe that life begins BEFORE conception, they should have absolutely no problem with IUDs.But Hawkins also declared that birth control pills should be illegal as well.However, birth control pills also prevent conception by stopping sperm from reaching an egg.According to Columbia University,Birth control pills prevent pregnancy through several mechanisms, mainly by stopping ovulation. If no egg is released, there is nothing to be fertilized by sperm, and the woman cannot get pregnant.So once again, Hawkins is wrong. But she repeated her claims again after Reid asked her to clarify her remarks, and Hawkins confirmed once and for all that anti-choice conservatives want to ban birth control as well as abortion. In my ideal world, yes. But I don t think that s something we re working towards in the pro-life movement. In the pro-life movement we re working towards abolishing abortion. That s why we want Planned Parenthood s money to go to health centers which don t do contraception. By taking money away from Planned Parenthood, millions of women would have less access to birth control that would prevent unwanted pregnancies and abortions. We ve gotten some real clarity,  Reid commented at the end of the segment.  I think the American people have gotten quite a bit of clarity on what your movement wants to do. Here s the video via VidMe.And if conservatives like Hawkins get their way, Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress will strip women of their reproductive rights. And women won t be marching in Washington in defense of their rights next time. They ll declare war on Washington.Featured image via screen capture ",News,"January 28, 2017"
6309, Obama’s Doing Something BIG To Raise Pay For Millions Of Americans (VIDEO),"Throughout his presidency, President Obama has dedicated himself to exploring policies with the goal of making life better for working Americans and making sure they are fairly compensated for their time and effort.Unfortunately, the GOP has become a major obstacle for the President ever since he stepped foot in the White House. After a Republican Congress made it perfectly clear that they won t even consider a minimum wage increase, the Obama administration was forced to seek out another alternative   and it s finally going to pay off. Thanks to Obama s overhaul on overtime pay   which doubles the salary level that workers must be paid overtime, millions of Americans are going to have more money in their pockets. This is major news, because this law hasn t been changed in over ten years!When Obama first mentioned that he wanted to revamp overtime pay, hardly anyone took him seriously. At his State of the Union address last year, the President said,  We still need to make sure employees get the overtime they ve earned.  Then, he unveiled a proposal to raise the income thresholds for those who would be eligible for overtime. It still seemed like faraway goal, until yesterday when the Labor Department finalized those new rules   an initiative that the Huffington Post called  one of the most ambitious economic reforms of the Obama era. Vice President Joe Biden announced the decision on Tuesday, stating that middle-class workers have  been getting clobbered  for decades. Biden said: The American people want to work. They want a fair shot. No handouts, no guarantees. Just a good job at a fair wage. Under the new rules, all workers earning salaries under the overtime salary threshold are entitled to time-and-a-half pay when they work over 40 hours per week   which many do. The previous threshold was only $23,660   making millions of struggling, hard-working Americans ineligible. But thanks to the Obama administration, that number will be doubled to $47,476, which guarantees overtime rights for any salaried workers earning underneath that number. Before this was changed, only 7% of Americans were eligible for overtime. And it gets better   the threshold will be updated by the Labor Department every three years to make sure that it keeps up with inflation.

21226,THE WOMAN WHO Moved Freedom Loving Americans To Tears With Her Passionate IRS Testimony Is Now Asking For Our Help,"MARCH 1st is the day! VOTE FOR BECKY GERRITSON FOR US CONGRESS IN ALABAMA S 2ND DISTRICT!WE LOVE THIS WOMAN! Becky Gerritson embodies everything that makes America so special and unique. She is a  limited government conservative  who is passionate about preserving and protecting the United States of America and everything we, as a nation stand for. She is a military wife and a brave warrior, who is ready to march to Washington DC and shake things up. Becky is running for US Rep. in Alabama s 2nd District. She is up against a RINO incumbent who, has voted to continue support for Obama s reckless Refugee program. Sending Representatives like Becky to DC, who are unafraid to confront an overreaching and out of control government should be a 1st priority for every freedom loving American.Becky moved out of her comfort zone, and into the national spotlight where she bravely faced Congress while staring down the punitive director of the IRS. In her powerful, passionate (and now famous) speech, she demanded the IRS was held accountable for the Stalinist tactics that were used against her, as they attempted silence her conservative views that were in stark contrast to Barack Obama.We are committed to helping Becky Gerritson defeat her RINO incumbent in Alabama.Becky Gerritson is up against an establishment Republican (RINO) in the primary election in Alabama who voted to continue support for a reckless refugee program.  Establishment Republicans are now facing serious primary challenges, such as incumbent establishment Republican Martha Roby in Alabama-2, who is being challenged by Becky Gerritson. Roby is trying desperately to run away from the Syrian refugee jihadi threat because she repeatedly voted to fund it.Conservative congressional challenger Becky Gerritson has just issued a stinging challenge on the issue of Muslim immigration to her incumbent establishment Republican opponent Rep. Martha Roby (AL-2). I promise to fight President Obama s open arms policy and oppose all legislation that invites danger into the lives of the men, women, and children of this great nation,  Gerritson stated in a pledge to Alabama voters.  In essence, this is Obama s Islamic Importation Plan; and we cannot risk adopting his strategy that fails to screen against importing terrorists into this country. And by giving Obama a blank check in the budget and spending bills that could have stopped the Syrian  refugee  madness Republicans own the Syrian refugee jihadi infiltration problem.Tea Partier, conservative, patriot, wife, mother, Christian- These are some of the words that describe Becky Gerritson, the grassroots activist who was thrown into the national spotlight during the illegal IRS probing of conservative and libertarian interest groups several years ago. During a passionate speech in front of an audience of a congressional sub committee, in which she testified on behalf of her organization- the Wetumpka TEA Party, Becky s words went viral instantly, and began to inspire and encourage activists across the country to hold their government more accountable for it s actions.In October of this year, Gerritson made the decision to shift from grassroots conservative activist, to instead take on the GOP establishment head-on by challenging current Congresswomen Martha Roby (R-AL, 2nd District) to a primary, in order to receive the Republican nomination in time for the 2016 election. Here are some questions Becky was able discuss with me in order to give voters, and Americans across the country, a better look at her candidacy, and what her campaign s presence means to the current state of the Republican Party and establishment politics as a whole:Brownell: Why have you decided now is the best time to run for office? Why congress and not a state level position?Becky: I ve never wanted to run for political office before, and I had always pushed back when others urged me to do so. However, after years of fighting for a restoration of the America I grew up in, I grew tired of seeing my representative fail to share my commitment. Our country is in desperate need of bold, courageous citizen leaders who will step forward to fight for principle. After much prayer, I knew I had to answer the call.Brownell: With the general dissatisfaction with the GOP, even with John Boehner gone, why did you decide to run as a Republican and not an Independent?Becky: I ll be the first to admit that there are many times in which I find myself frustrated with my Party. However, I believe that there is strategic significance to trying to save the Republican Party from within. In Congress, I won t go with what Party leadership over principle. I will, however, use whatever influence I have to return my Party back to conservatism.Brownell: What are some of the biggest concerns you hear from voters in you re district?Becky: Voters are concerned about the future. They see a President and an unelected Supreme Court ruling, not governing. They see their rights taken away. They see a debt rising that threatens the security and economic stability of this country. And, what s worse, many feel helpless. They vote, and then they see nothing change. I m running to be the kind of leader that the voters can know and trust will actually stand up and fight the status quo to change the direction of this country.Brownell: On your website s issues page you have a section discussing your views on the 10th Amendment- do you think that the states have the right to nullify executive orders and acts of congress?Becky: You know, I think every branch of government needs to start exercising its constitutional authority. We need to reign in the Judicial and Executive branches, and the best way to do that is by the Legislative branch and the states reasserting themselves and say  no, Mr. President  or  no, Supreme Court, we are drawing the line here, and you cannot cross.  The 10th Amendment has been totally thrown out, and we need more states standing strong in opposition to unconstitutional actions by the federal government.Brownell: As a military wife currently living in a part of Alabama with a large veterans community, do you think the VA needs to be reformed from within, or privatized?Becky: It needs to be completely overhauled, and I think all options need to be on the table. My opponent is pushing to put the solution in the hands of the same VA bureaucracy that got us in this mess. Top-down, bottom- up this system must be overhauled, every job and individual evaluated, and the very manner of doing things analyzed to make sure our veterans never have to deal with an incompetent VA again.Brownell: What is your view of possible boots on the ground in Syria?Becky: Under this president, I absolutely oppose that idea. Under a Republican president, I m still skeptical. The case needs to be made first what our interests are in getting involved. Secondly, a clear strategy for winning- not just the moment, but the long-term future of the region- must be presented. I don t know that those two criteria will ever be met. I believe very strongly in American exceptionalism and leadership in the world. I also believe that we should be very hesitant to send our soldiers into a quagmire. A very strong case would need to be made for this course of action, and I m not sure that case exists.PLEASE click HERE to see where Becky Gerritson stands on issues that affect our entire nation.

4847, Poll Shows Growing Number Of Republicans Don’t Think Trump Is The Best Option For The GOP,"With 70 days until election day and Hillary Clinton still up (significantly) in the polls, it appears Republicans may be doubting who they chose as their presidential nominee.According to a new poll released from HuffPost/YouGov on Monday, 54 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning voters said Donald Trump is not the best nominee for their party. That number is up 10 points since this question was last asked in June, when 44 percent said he was not the best option. Monday s poll also showed that only 35 percent of Republicans were satisfied with Trump being the nominee, down from 44 percent in June.However, Republicans feel they are stuck. When asked if they could have a do-over in the primaries, only 39 percent said they would choose someone different. Ted Cruz, Trump s closest rival, garnered 15 percent among responders, with Marco Rubio coming in third at 14 percent, and the rest of the candidates divvied up among 10 points. Twenty-nine percent said they would still have backed Trump.In contrast, 53 percent of Democrats who were polled are content with Clinton being their party s nominee, while 37 percent do not.Republicans, you reap what you sow. It must suck to have a candidate throwing an election away, killing the party  chances of taking back the House, and making a mockery of the United States abroad. The GOP made their bed and now they are going to lie in it.With the Senate and Supreme Court hanging in the balance for Republicans, Trump has continued a campaign of foot-in-mouth, angering many right-wing diehards like Ann Coulter and Sarah Palin for a supposed  flip-flop  on immigration, while simultaneously keeping moderate Republicans at arm s length.In other words, the GOP is having a complete meltdown. Trump, once seen as the conservative savior for the Republican Party, is not hated by factions on both sides of the ideological coin.Featured image via Stephen Maturen/Getty Images",News,"August 30, 2016"
9300,FLASHBACK To 2014 WaPo Headline: “Obama Should Fire John Brennan” For Lying…Only One Year After James Clapper Was Caught Lying Under Oath,"Yesterday, the leftist media spent the day wringing their hands in anticipation of finally pinning a Russian collusion story on President Trump, after General Flynn admitted to lying to the FBI about meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, during the Trump transition period. It now appears that Flynn s testimony is a big nothingburger. In fact, if the media was being honest with the American people, they would be telling them that Flynn s admission doesn t hold a candle to the lies former President Barack Obama s regime was caught telling. Barack Obama s regime lied about matters that actually were much more serious in nature. Many of their lies were about covering up for the deaths of innocent Americans. From Obama s crooked former AG, Eric Holder, who lied about the illegal gun running program Fast n  Furious that was responsible for the death of US Border Agent BrianTerry, to the lies his former national security advisor, Susan Rice told, when she went on a media-blitz to knowingly lie, when she told Americans the death of 4 Americans in Benghazi, was caused by a video. It s got to be pretty bad, when a staunch Obama media ally, the Washington Post, tells him he should fire his CIA Director, John Brennan for lying.  From the Washington Post:In March, at the Council on Foreign Relations, CIA Director John Brennan was asked by NBC s Andrea Mitchell whether the CIA had illegally accessed Senate Intelligence Committee staff computers  to thwart an investigation by the committee into  the agency s past interrogation techniques. The accusation had been made earlier that day by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who said the CIA had  violated the separation-of-powers principles embodied in the United States Constitution.  Brennan answered:As far as the allegations of, you know, CIA hacking into, you know, Senate computers, nothing could be further from the truth. I mean, we wouldn t do that. I mean, that s   that s just beyond the   you know, the scope of reason in terms of what we would do. { }And, you know, when the facts come out on this, I think a lot of people who are claiming that there has been this tremendous sort of spying and monitoring and hacking will be proved wrong.Watch Brennan lie to Andrea Mitchell here:Now we know that the truth was far different. The Post s Greg Miller reports:CIA Director John O. Brennan has apologized to leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee after an agency investigation determined that its employees improperly searched computers used by committee staff to review classified files on interrogations of prisoners. { }A statement released by the CIA on Tuesday acknowledged that agency employees had searched areas of that computer network that were supposed to be accessible only to committee investigators. Agency employees were attempting to discover how congressional aides had obtained a secret CIA internal report on the interrogation program. Some employees acted in a manner inconsistent with the common understanding reached  between the CIA and lawmakers in 2009, when the committee investigation was launched, according to the agency statement, which cited a review by the CIA s inspector general. The CIA statement was first reported by McClatchy.That committee s investigation is said to be sharply critical of the CIA, finding that it exaggerated the effectiveness of harsh interrogation measures and repeatedly misled members of Congress and the executive branch. The findings are expected to be released publicly within weeks.After briefing committee leaders, Brennan  apologized to them for such actions by CIA officers as described in the [inspector general] report,  the agency statement said. Brennan also ordered the creation of an internal personnel board, led by former Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.), to review the agency employees  conduct and determine  potential disciplinary measures. An apology and an internal review board might suffice if this were Brennan or intelligence leaders  first offense, but the track record is far from spotless. In 2011, Brennan claimed that dozens of U.S. drone strikes on overseas targets had not killed a single civilian. This remarkable success rate was not only disputed at the time by news reports   even supporters of the drone program called it  absurd    but as the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the New York Times both reported later, President Obama received reports from the very beginning of his presidency about drone strikes killing numerous civilians. As Obama s top counterterrorism adviser at the time, Brennan would have received these reports as well, so either Brennan knew that his claim was a lie, or he is secretly deaf. Similarly, Brennan denied snooping on Senate computers six weeks after Feinstein first made the accusation to the CIA in private, which means either that he was lying, or he had ignored a serious charge against his agency for six weeks, then spouted off about it without any real knowledge   hardly the behavior expected of an agency director.And last year, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper lied under oath to Congress when he told Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and the Senate Intelligence Committee that the National Security Agency did not collect any kind of data on millions of Americans, a claim later disproved by documents leaked by former NSA employee Edward Snowden. Despite Clapper receiving criticism from both sides of the aisle, the damage to Clapper s and the White House s credibility on intelligence and civil liberties issues and, well, the fact that lying to Congress is a crime (though one that s difficult to prosecute), Obama has not disciplined Clapper in any way.",politics,"Dec 2, 2017"
6279, The Pope Just Called Most American Employers (And Donald Trump) ‘Bloodsuckers’,"Pope Francis is no fan of Walmart or of McDonalds, or really of many American companies. In a powerful mass at the Vatican, he called companies that exploit workers  bloodsuckers  and the people who work there,  slaves.  He also said the employers were committing a mortal sin.During mass at the Vatican, he told a story about a girl who found a job working 11 hours a day for 650 euros ($729) a month, paid  under the table . This is starving the people with their work for my own profit! Living on the blood of the people. And this is a mortal sin,  he said at the service in his Santa Marta residence. Without a pension, without health care   then they suspend (the contract), and in July and August (the workers) have to eat air. And in September, they laugh at you about it. Those who do that are true bloodsuckers.  ($1 = 0.8919 euros)Source: ReutersIt s hard to read those words without imagining that the Pope is speaking directly to Americans. The United States is the only country in the developed world that doesn t offer universal healthcare. Fewer than half of Americans have a pension or even a 401(k). Only about half of employers offer any sort of retirement plan.Before Ronald Reagan, it was standard for companies to offer pensions and even health insurance. Then, 401(k) s which are a gift to Wall Street, came along, and pensions went away as some employers chose to offer nothing at all.Not only does this make the companies  bloodsuckers,  it s a bad business move, at least for companies that value their employees. Because people aren t tied to their jobs with pensions, they are leaving them. The average turnover rate is about 40 percent a year.Now, we know how hard Republicans fight against basic health care for all. We also know how hard they fight against a living wage, but we hear little about pensions, unless it s about companies stealing pensions from their employees. The Pope didn t mention that  bloodsucking  tactic. The fact is, though, that Republicans don t like pensions any more than they like healthcare or paid time off. They are doing their best to end them, whether it be public pensions or through destroying unions.

His radical Treasury Secretary, Jack Lew is no exception.Treasury Secretary Jack Lew  announced yesterday that Alexander Hamilton s face will remain on the front of the $10 bill and Harriet Tubman will replace Andrew Jackson on the face of the $20 bill.What the Left forgot in their haste to replace a  racist  white (Democrat) President on the front of the $20 bill was the fact that Harriet Tubman was more than just a black abolitionist, she also serves as an excellent example of why our Second Amendment is so important.Harriet Tubman (born Araminta Harriet Ross; 1820   March 10, 1913) was an African-American abolitionist, humanitarian, and Union spy during the American Civil War. She carried a revolver, and was not afraid to use it . . .Once a slave agreed to join her expedition, there was no turning back; she threatened to shoot anyone who tried to return. Tubman told the tale of one journey with a group of fugitive slaves, when morale sank and one man insisted he was going to go back to the plantation.She pointed the gun at his head and said,  You go on or die.  Several days later, he was with the group as they entered Canada. It is more than likely that Tubman carried the handgun as protection from ever-present slave catchers and their dogs.Via: The Truth About GunsBreaking: Treasury throws founder of the Democratic Party off $20 bill, replaces with gun-toting Republican pic.twitter.com/G9dVXpTaXv  David Burge (@iowahawkblog) April 20, 2016Tubman s reliance on her firearms to fulfill her mission of freeing slaves was essential.

He s running out of defenses, so Trump turned to one of his old hits. He s blaming the accusations on the Mexicans. Well, one Mexican in particular: billionaire Carlos Slim.As early as Friday, Mr. Trump is planning to claim that Mr. Slim, as a shareholder of New York Times Co. and donor to the Clinton Foundation, has an interest in helping Hillary Clinton s campaign, according to a Trump adviser.Attacking the Mexican billionaire would allow Mr. Trump to hit several targets. He could slam the  failing  New York Times, which he says had to be  rescued  by a  foreigner    Mr. Slim, the adviser said.Source: VoxUnfortunately, this is how Trump sees the world. People are either with him or against him. Not surprisingly for the controversial land developer, Trump has made a lot of enemies, and it appears those enemies are spread throughout the world. That alone should disqualify him for the position that is in large part, diplomacy.Beyond that, though, this is a man who refuses to take responsibility for his own actions. He admitted on tape the he grabs women  by the pussy.  Why should it surprise anyone that he actually grabbed some? Here s a list of all the women who (so far) have accused Trump. Even if Trump is right that it s some sort of personal vendetta by the New York Times (he s not), reports have come out in the Daily Beast, from CBS News, from a People Magazine reporter, from the Palm Beach Post, from Rolling Stone, from BuzzFeed, from the Guardian, from Vanity Fair, from USA Today, from Jezebel, from the New Yorker and from the Washington Post.Gotta wonder how he s going to blame the Mexicans (or perhaps the Chinese) on all of these.Featured image via Ty Wright/Getty Images.",News,"October 14, 2016"

[VIDEO]"," He [Obama] makes me want to wrap a suicide vest around my head and text BOOM to my brain On the Brit s desire to be politically correct about Muslims invasion of UK: You are too busy gazing at the fluff in your navel to see the gangrene in your foot Trump is terrifying. We have seen the future and it is bleak  said one reporter.In turn, thousands are busy clicking on a hideously impotent petition to  BAN TRUMP FROM GREAT BRITAIN .What exactly are they achieving? Having their say? Joining in the outrage bus?No doubt petition sites like change.org are on their web favourites, right up there with erectile dysfunction.co.uk. and single.com.They may as well calm down. We are not banning Donald from the UK.And even if Trump were elected President, he wouldn t be able to ban Muslims from his shores   even if he wanted to.Ask yourself: how could he possibly make it work?America struggles to control its southern border as it is. It is not going to be able to change the global passport system and get your religion stamped on your passport or your head to establish your faith.What s the Christianity test going to be? Snurfling a hot dog whilst singing  Give me joy in my heart, keep me praising ? After a Muslim couple gunned down 14 residents of San Bernardino, California, Americans looked for strong leadership. Just like after 9/11 when Bush made like a dog of war and took the fight to the terrorists.They didn t get from dreary Obama.

In contrast, Trump IS providing leadership. He knows some of his grand-standing is hot air. But he is articulating a sentiment held by millions and reinforcing himself as a protector of the American people.It s the reason Trump is the Republican front runner. He has spent just $330,000 on broadcasting to Jeb Bush s $42.5 million  which is indicative of how much America is enthralled by this new voice.I hear cries that he is a blithering idiot. I have often been called a deranged fool. But if this were true you could ignore me, ignore us, imaging the two of us shouting naked at the rain.It s because we articulate sentiments repressed by the politically correct consensus that we have a voice.Trump said:  We have places in London so radicalised that police are afraid for their lives. Within moments the Met Police, Prime Minister David Cameron, and the clownish Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, jumped to defend the reputation of the UK and distance themselves from this glaring truth.Yet, at the time of writing, no less than five bobbies on the beat have come forward to confirm that there ARE estates where they will only patrol out of uniform.There is fear among the police AND the public.I work with a team of cameramen in town who text their wives and partners on the hour to confirm they are safe.My family is not keen for me to be in the capital.Some friends will no longer come to London.How do you feel about the security of the city s shopping centres right now, after what happened in Paris?I watch the BBC news, our national broadcaster, ramming home messages of inclusiveness.Today they gave platform to a representative of the Muslim community telling Trump he is an Islamophobe and is not welcome here.But that s not my voice. That is not the voice of a nation. All Brits don t think that way.Being force-fed multi-culturalism brought us to this place. When the only permitted message is acceptance, any views to the contrary result in a label to shame you into silence.Racist! Islamophobe! Nazi!Don t just stick a label it. Be curious. Wonder, how has Trump come to articulate the views of a majority of Republicans across the States?Because I don t buy into the clear divide between extremist Muslims and peaceful ones. I don t see these as two separate entities. It is a sliding scale, a spectrum. From utterly peaceful, to ambivalence to sympathising, to extremist, to a man blowing up buses in Woburn Place.It is the same slippery slope which sees regular mosque attendees from Luton slip off to Syria to join ISIS. And suddenly a tight knit Muslim community knows nothing.Not the local imam, not local families, no one. No one denouncing terrorism. Just a wall of silence. In our country.Hate hidden behind walls we are told to accept and tolerate because we are multi-cultural. Repeat after me. Multi-cultural.History teaches us lessons were refuse to learn.The IRA would not have enjoyed decades of success without many among the Northern Irish Catholic population acting just the same way as the imams and family and friends of extremists in Luton today.We have gone too far and lost control of vast swathes of our country. In part we ARE a radicalised nation and it does nobody any favours to deny the obvious.Trump wants to call a temporary halt to Muslim immigration until America figures out what is going on.Adversaries may be quick to jump on Trump and make him the problem.But look around. You are too busy gazing at the fluff in your navel to see the gangrene in your foot.You lost sight of terrifying.It isn t a big, brash American untroubled by the need to be loved.

6072," The PGA Just Gave Donald Trump A Big Middle Finger, And He’s P*ssed","Long before Donald Trump owned the Doral Golf Course   in 1962, to be exact   it became the home to the PGA World Golf Championships. Now, the tournament is moving to Mexico, one of the countries the presidential candidate rants the most about on the campaign trial, and the billionaire is not happy, not at all.Supposedly, it s not a political move. It is purely economic. The auto manufacturer, Cadillac, pulled out of sponsorship, so they have to leave Trump s resort and head to cheaper grounds.Fox News asked Trump about the move, and he didn t waiver from his antagonistic and xenophobic campaign rhetoric. Cadillac s been a great sponsor, but they re moving it to Mexico,  Trump said in a Tuesday night interview on Fox News.  They re moving it to Mexico City which, by the way, I hope they have kidnapping insurance. They re moving it to Mexico City,  he continued.  And I m saying, you know, what s going on here? It is so sad when you look at what s going on with our country. For Cadillac, it all boiled down to money. The cost to them for sponsorship is well above $10 million for a single tournament. Beyond that, people just don t care that much anymore. The tournament has lost its luster,  said Erik Compton, a PGA Tour player who lives in Miami.  The community just doesn t seem as involved. Source: ESPNWhile this isn t political, Trump obviously takes it very personally   as he should. While this wasn t intended to be a Donald Trump snub, almost any country would have been better for Trump than Mexico, the country against which Trump wants to build a giant wall. It s also a country Trump has accused of intentionally sending its criminals our way: The worst elements in Mexico are being pushed into the United States by the Mexican government. The largest suppliers of heroin, cocaine and other illicit drugs are Mexican cartels that arrange to have Mexican immigrants trying to cross the borders and smuggle in the drugs. The Border Patrol knows this,  Trump wrote.  Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border. The United States has become a dumping ground for Mexico and, in fact, for many other parts of the world.

5048, Evan McMullin: ‘Never In His Life’ Has Trump Had To Watch His Mouth (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s mouth gets him into trouble a lot. There have been endless examples of his inability to curb what he says, which in and of itself means that he is disqualified from the presidency. There are many right-wingers who are so terrified of Trump that they are backing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and while others won t vote for Clinton, they won t vote for Trump, either.Well, now, conservatives have another option: Former CIA operative Evan McMullin. While he has never held public office, McMullin is certainly a sight better than Trump. His candidacy, at this late stage of the 2016 race, is most likely just a way to stop Trump; after all, he entered the race far too late to gain any real traction, and Independent bids for the presidency in America always fail spectacularly. However, thanks to the outrageous nature of Trump s candidacy, McMullin is definitely shaking things up.Appearing on ABC s This Week, McMullin had quite a few choice words for Trump. He said: He s not a credible candidate. It s clear, the numbers, the fact that Donald Trump can t control what he says. He s never had to control what he said. Never in life has he had to do that. It s unrealistic to expect him to do that now. McMullin went on to make the case for voters to consider him instead of one of the two major party candidates: We need someone who will bring this country together. I firmly believe that the time has come in this country for a new generation of leadership, and that certainly is not Donald Trump nor [Democratic nominee] Hillary Clinton. Clearly I disagree with the guy regarding Hillary Clinton. She is easily the most qualified person to ever run for the office of the presidency. But McMullin is definitely right about Trump. There s no way in hell that guy should be anywhere near the nukes. All McMullin s candidacy would do is help further shift things in Clinton s direction, and that is A-OK with me.Watch McMullin s remarks below:.@Evan_McMullin: Trump's ""never had to control what he says It's unrealistic to expect him to do that now."" https://t.co/HFwtipADk6  This Week (@ThisWeekABC) August 14, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"August 14, 2016"
20812,NATIONAL ENQUIRER ENDORSED TRUMP…Then Dropped YUGE Bombshell: “CRUZ’S 5 SECRET MISTRESSES”,"Unfortunately, in this day and age, it doesn t really matter if the story is true or not. The propaganda driven media, and Americans who hang on their every word (especially the anti-God Left), are so anxious for red meat on one of the top GOP presidential candidates, the story will stick regardless of its validity   Here s Trump s Spokesperson, Katrina Pearson on the tabloid story:What's worse? People who actually believe the trash in tabloids, or the ones who know it's false &spread it anyway? #stupidity on all levels  Katrina Pierson (@KatrinaPierson) March 25, 2016One thing I ve learned from writing about politics for 10 years is that you ll never talk someone out of believing something they really want to believe. (At least you won t if you re a mediocre writer. Maybe great writers are different.) Another thing I ve learned is that there s no way to cover ratf*cking without participating in it. An accusation is made, it reaches a critical mass of public awareness, then you re forced to choose between ignoring a matter of public interest and spreading the accusation by addressing it. It s a testament to how far this has spread already that Cruz himself felt obliged to say something.Here s the National Enquirer story alleging that Cruz has had affairs with at least five women. Wait, let me rephrase: Here s the National Enquirer story alleging that there are  claims  that  private detectives  are investigating affairs with at least five women that Cruz has  supposedly  had. Two possibilities here:1. It s all true. Better men than Cruz have exploited their stature in Washington for sexual conquests. And the Enquirer s been right before about political sex scandals that no one else would touch. As every Trump fan on Twitter will eagerly tell you today, they got the John Edwards story right. Meanwhile, we re still waiting for further details on the 12 mistresses Barack Obama supposedly has. Or how it could be that Hillary Clinton had six months to live six months ago. Or why no major mainstream newspaper has yet exposed the fact that Antonin Scalia was assassinated by a hooker hired by the CIA. Personally, I m more interested in that one than this Cruz business.2. It s a smear. As it turns out, the Enquirer is emphatically pro-Trump. They endorsed him a few weeks ago. He s been friends with the paper s CEO, David Pecker, for years. And this wouldn t be the first time they ve done him a solid by publishing a spoonfed attack on one of his opponents, according to Gabriel Sherman. Supposedly it was Team Trump that handed the Enquirer a story last year about Ben Carson leaving a medical sponge inside a patient. It s also noteworthy, as Cruz himself mentions in the clip, that Trump advisor turned Trump cheerleader Roger Stone is the only quoted source in the Enquirer piece.Whether or not the target denies the claim is unimportant. The point is to plant the possibility that it s true in the audience s minds, knowing that some will believe it. So here we have with the Cruz accusation a publication that s in the tank for Trump, that s allegedly willing to fling sh*t for him, and that s in contact with people renowned for their own willingness and ability to supply sh*t to the media. Could it be that the accusation is sh*t itself?In a weird twist, Trump s own spokeswoman, Katrina Pierson   a former spokeswoman for Cruz   is identified in the Enquirer piece as one of the alleged mistresses via a partially distorted photo that s nonetheless clear enough. Pierson denies any relationship with Cruz:Of course the National Enquirer story is 100% FALSE!!! I only speak to myself, however.Carry on  Katrina Pierson (@KatrinaPierson) March 25, 2016Certain publications were eager to use a supposed threat against Ted Cruz by worldwide hacker group  Anonymous  as proof that he was guilty as charged. A threat from a hacker group  Anonymous  must mean Cruz is guilty right? Unfortunately, the video they re using is not even from the official  Anonymous official  account. How about doing a little homework guys?Here s the video they re using:The publications who are using Billy Anderson s video as proof that Anonymous is threatening Ted Cruz, as a way to prop up Donald Trump, might want to look up a video the OFFICIAL Anonymous account posted about Donald Trump:https://youtu.be/PvCC2qONQFgLastly, before voters fall for a video from Anonymous posted by Billy Anderson (who has only 2 videos on his account) they may want to better understand how Anonymous really feels about the upcoming elections.

5999, Hillary’s New Ad Brilliantly Uses Those Who Have Endorsed Trump Against Him (VIDEO),"Since the start of Donald Trump s campaign for President of the United States, there s been a heavy amount of racism. For most sane-minded individuals, this racism was obvious and purposeful. Many have been speaking out and standing up against such a blatant disregard for those who have immigrated to the United States from Latin American countries.Through most of Trump s campaign, many of his fellow Republicans have just chosen to ignore the obvious racism, because it became clear that the Republican base of voters wanted this rhetoric as Trump s popularity rose and pushed him into the presumptive nominee spot.It would seem, however, that Trump s latest remarks surrounding the judge that is to preside over the Trump University case, is too much for even high-ranking Republicans who have backed him for the presidency. Trump doesn t believe a judge of Mexican descent should preside over his case. Not only that, he doesn t want a Muslim either. And what next? No women, gay individuals, or any people of color whatsoever?It s become obvious Trump wants a white male America and he s not even hiding it.Noticing the clear disdain for Trump s remarks by his Republican allies was the Hillary Clinton campaign, and they brilliantly put together an ad using all of their words against the presumptive nominee.It may become the most damaging ad yet, as Trump may have finally gone too far for even his own party, with Newt Gingrich, a man who has been rumored to be a potential VP for Trump, saying: This is one of the worst mistakes Trump has made.

7406, Trump Fan Drives Jeep Through Crowd Of Protesters (VIDEO),"Saturday afternoon, a group of protesters gathered on the main road leading into Fountain Hills, the location of Donald Trump s latest hatefest, and set up a  Quarrantine  of the rally. Traffic was backed up for miles as the demonstrators peacefully protested the rally   but many Trump fans were displeased that people chose to act in opposition to their leader s wishes.On social media, some fanatical supporters of The Donald called for the protesters to be  tear gassed and shot,  while others had another idea    run them over.  Some even began inquiring as to the legality of pancaking peaceful demonstrators with one s car. While it might seem unbelievable that someone would take these insane fringe-nuts up on their suggestion,WKBW reports that one Jeep-driving Trump fan wanted to get to the rally so badly that he plowed into the protesters  with his vehicle.Video of the scene shows the unnamed driver pushing his way through the crowd with zero regard for the safety of the human beings in front of his vehicle. The demonstrators can be seen moving out of the way, some obviously panicked, while others attempt to stop their assailant from moving any further.It might be expected that the police who were present would wish to stop the driver, but they can clearly be seen on the video providing an escort, even shoving around people who are attempting to stop the driver whose appointment with Trump was more important than the safety of the demonstrators.Fortunately, no one was injured, though this incident makes it clear that the cops were there for one purpose: to protect Donald Trump rather than the people.In 2014, a vehicle moving at a similar speed plowed through a crowd of Michael Brown supporters. While it was not moving quickly, one protester s leg became trapped by the wheel and she was dragged at least 20 feet before she was able to free herself. Like the operator of this Jeep, the driver kept going with zero regard for the assembled crowd.It is unclear why police chose not to intervene, but it is noteworthy that law enforcement reaction to the protest is managed by anti-Hispanic bigot, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who recently endorsed The Donald. Is it any wonder that his men did not care about the safety of anyone who was not there to worship Trump?Watch the video below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"March 19, 2016"
20615,NOT KIDDING: ARIZONA NEWSPAPER Concerned Border Fence Too High For Illegals To Cross Safely,"When the fence keeps them from making it to the polls, the Democrats start complaining  A mainstream Arizona newspaper is decrying the small section of the Arizona-Mexico border that has a 14-foot-high primary fence because it is too high for illegal immigrants to safely cross. The article,  Border Fence Jumpers Breaking Bones,  includes the claim that sections of the border with a 14-foot-high fence are  as tall as a two or three-story house  and tells the stories of several women who broke bones and were treated extensively to healthcare and surgeries at the expense of U.S. taxpayers. The writer never mentions any lives directly lost as a result of there not being a border fence in most sections, such as when Mexican nationals crossed into the U.S. and murdered father and husband Robert Rosas, a U.S. Border Patrol agent.The article in question was written by Perla Trevizo for the Arizona Daily Star. In the excerpt below, note the section s subtitle and the casual mention that the foreign woman had been deported multiple times prior:A DREAM ENDSFor some, the fence is a last resort.Maria Ibarra, 28 and also from Oaxaca, had tried crossing through Nogales and El Paso in April, but both times she was sent back to Mexico.This time she was determined to get through. She left her 10-year-old son with her parents in Oaxaca. He was born in South Carolina, where she lived for two years before going back to Mexico in 2006 so her parents and siblings could meet her son.Once there, she said, her son started losing his hearing in one ear and having seizures. All I wanted was an opportunity to fight my case,  she said. She hoped her son could join her or maybe she could get a permit to visit the hospitals where he was first treated. But she already had a couple of deportations and a voluntary return to Mexico.Interestingly, the part about the woman hoping her son could join her is errant in not mentioning that once her son does join her in the U.S., the woman and her son would likely be permitted to stay because they would then be an incomplete family unit.The assertion that the border fence is as tall as a two or three-story house came from Fernando Valdez, Mexico s deputy consul general in Nogales, Arizona. He was quoted as stating,  What surprises us is that people continue to jump from heights that can be the equivalent of a two- or even three-story house,  he said.  But we hear they feel pressured to do it because they are holding the line or they start insulting them, telling them to jump. The second part of his statement appears to be directed towards U.S. Border Patrol agents, but the writer left the intended direction of the assertion ambiguous. Of course, if that be the case, the Border Patrol routinely saves illegal immigrants  lives, as the article inadvertently makes clear. Mexican authorities routinely demonize and attack U.S. Border Patrol agents, even in cases where agents have acted in self-defense against the violent narco-traffickers or other violent individuals.Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of the advocacy article is that the writer did not mention why a segmented border security fence exists. The fence, which contrary to left-of-center media assertions does not encompass most of the border, was built largely to stop violent criminals from their routine entering and existing of U.S. communities. Two instances come to mind, though in both cases the  wall  has yet to be built in those specific segments. In 2002, the FBI engaged in a sting operation in Sunland Park, New Mexico along the U.S.-Mexico Border. The effort was spurred by Mexicans routinely crossing the border and robbing trains of cargo. Mexicans would jump the small chain-link fence that served as the area s only border security and rob the train cars. They would then simply jump back across the fence and U.S. authorities were powerless to stop them. Mexican authorities, often corrupted by the criminal organizations behind the robberies and thefts, did nothing to stop the crimes.Two FBI special agents got separated from their group in the sting. One of them was a woman. The two agents were surrounded by dozens of Mexican nationals who beat them unconscious and caused severe injuries, including broken facial bones. A federal agent with knowledge of the incident spoke to Breitbart Texas on the condition of anonymity and said,  There were indicators that the Mexican nationals were trying to drag the unconscious body of the female FBI agent back with them into Mexico. This writer previously covered the issue in 2013 and wrote,  Only a few of the men were eventually prosecuted, as most were deported back to Mexico prior to prosecution. Unless something else happened or they moved, the men are still free and presumably operating in the area. The very nature of a fence is that it poses a difficulty or risk to unauthorized crossings in an area, such as in the recent issue of Barack Obama s White House raising the height of their fence to keep unwanted people from crossing. In Arizona s specific border situation, there exist two border sectors: the Tucson Sector and the Yuma Sector. Though the Yuma Sector is largely locked down with significant coverage of technology and a primary and secondary fence, the Tucson Sector is largely open.

20689,NBA THREATENS NC…Let Men Share Bathrooms With Your Daughters Or We’ll Cancel All-Star Game,"So in other words, parents better allow men to use the same bathrooms and locker rooms as your little girls or the NBA is gathering up their balls and running away. Is the NBA still a professional sports organization, or have they morphed into a radical social change group? If the answer is the latter, you won t see me pay another dime to sit in the stands of another NBA game. I don t think I m alone in that thinking either. Putting social issues before the safety and well-being of women and children is misguided and dangerous. Click HERE to comment on NBA Commissioner Adam Silver s Facebook page. Commissioner Adam Silver believes the NBA has been  crystal clear  that the 2017 All-Star Game only stays in Charlotte if a North Carolina law goes.Political and business leaders he s spoken with in the state believe it will, so he s holding off for now on setting any deadlines for when the NBA might act.Silver said last week that the law that limits anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay and transgender people was  problematic  for the league, but he believed dialogue was more useful than ultimatums at this point, so has continued discussions with North Carolina officials. The sense was that if the NBA could give us some time, they in the community of North Carolina were optimistic they would see a change in the law. They weren t guaranteeing it and I think which was why my response was the event still is 10 months from now, we don t need to make a decision yet,  Silver said Thursday during a meeting of Associated Press Sports Editors. We ve been, I think, crystal clear that we believe a change in the law is necessary for us to play in the kind of environment that we think is appropriate for a celebratory NBA event, but that we did have some time and that if the view of the people who were allied with us in terms of a change, if their view, the people on the ground in North Carolina, was that the situation would best be served by us not setting a deadline, we would not set a deadline at this time. The North Carolina law directs transgender people to use public toilets corresponding to the sex listed on their birth certificate. The law also excludes LGBT people from state anti-discrimination protections, blocks local governments from expanding LGBT protections, and bars all types of workplace discrimination lawsuits from state courts.Several entertainment acts have already canceled plans for North Carolina but Silver said last week he didn t think a warning that the NBA could pull the All-Star weekend out would send the proper message, particularly because the league still has the Charlotte Hornets, owned by Michael Jordan, playing there. The Hornets host playoff games this weekend.All-Star weekend is scheduled for February. Silver said there is no urgency to make a decision because the league could very easily find out which arenas would take on the event if necessary.Via: AP News  ",left-news,"Apr 23, 2016"
20133,CAN HILLARY LIE HER WAY OUT OF THIS ONE? PHYSICIAN Says Hillary Has Parkinson’s Disease…Hillary Admits She Couldn’t Even “Get Up” After Convention,"Will Hillary s health be the only thing she can t hide by lying? She s the only presidential candidate who travels with a full-time physician Hillary Clinton stated Friday that she did not know if she could even stand up because she was so exhausted during the disastrous Democratic convention in Philly. By the end of those two weeks that s exactly how I felt, it was,  Oh my gosh, I don t know that I can get up, let alone what I will do if I am vertical,  Hillary Clinton said in a campaign podcast. I, knock on wood, am pretty lucky because I have a lot of stamina and endurance, which is necessary in the kind of campaign I m engaged in,  Clinton stated. Via: Breitbart NewsMeanwhile a top physicians says Hillary has Parkinson s Disease.Hillary Clinton Has Parkinson s Disease, Physician Confirms #HillarysHealth https://t.co/Z8qPlzpvMu  Mike Cernovich   (@Cernovich) August 12, 2016Hillary s health is declining, as anyone who has looked at her can see. The question is: What condition does she have? A board certified Anesthesiologist has written a memo of Hillary s health.Hillary Clinton (HRC) has suffered a variety of health issues. Unfortunately, she has declined to make her medical records public. In July of 2015 her personal physician released a letter asserting her  excellent physical condition.  Unfortunately, multiple later episodes recorded on video strongly suggest that the content of the letter is incorrect. This discussion is designed to sort through the known facts and propose a possible medical explanation for these events. In keeping with Occam s Razor, a single explanation that covers everything is preferred.History of Hillary s Health: In 2009, HRC fell and broke her elbow. Little else was made public.[i] On December 17, 2012, while Secretary of State, HRC fell and suffered a concussion.[ii]Later, a transverse sinus thrombosis was diagnosed, resulting in chronic anticoagulation therapy. [iii] Her post-concussion syndrome was declared  recovered  in about six months.[iv] The original fall was publicly attributed to dehydration following gastroenteritis. An email from Huma Abedin (HRC s closest advisor) on January 26, 2013, says that HRC  is often confused. [v] Photos show being assisted up what appears to be the steps of a residential porch. This apparently happened in February of 2016. On August 4, 2016, Reuters and Getty published the photos.[vi] At a rally on May 2, 2016, HRC demonstrates classic PD hand posturing.[vii] She has no lectern in front, so she starts with her right hand pressed against her chest. At the 18:02 mark, she starts gesturing with her right hand, which is in a very unnatural position that is common in PD. On July 21, 2016 HRC was filmed talking to reporters at close range when several spoke at once. Without warning, she started a bizarre head-bobbing episode that must be seen rather than described. After several cycles, she regained control and declared that the reporters  must try the iced chai. [viii]WATCH HERE: On July 28, 2016, during the balloon drop, HRC suddenly looks up with a frozen wide-mouth and wide-eyed stare. After a couple of seconds she regains control and a more normal expression.[ix] On August 5, HRC declared that she had  short circuited [x] a response to Chris Wallace in an interview that aired July 31 on Fox News Sunday.[xi] August 6, 2016, at a campaign rally, HRC freezes with wide eyes in response to protestors. A large black male who commonly accompanies her leans in and tells her  It s OK. We re not going anywhere. Keep talking  Shortly after, she laughs strangely and then says  OK. Here we are. We ll keep talking. [xii] Several recent photos show HRC with an inappropriately exaggerated wide-mouthed smile and extreme wide-open eyes. Several videos show her laughing inappropriately and for extended periods. Numerous events have been interrupted by prolonged episodes of coughing unrelated to any infectious cause.This discussion will not argue that the black male is carrying a diazepam injector, since there is a plausible argument that it is actually a small flashlight, and is seen in other video to be such. We will also not discuss the circular area on her tongue. It appears to be the site of a mass excision. Benign explanations that do not bear on chronic health issues may easily be proffered.After the 2012 fall, HRC had post-concussion syndrome (PCS). She should have declared herself unable to fulfill her duties as Secretary of State. Her resignation from the position shortly thereafter may have satisfied this need without public medical discussion. If no other questionable medical signs had appeared, this discussion would end here. But the other events and signs point to a single cause for the fall, and it is not the public explanation. Further, HRC s statement early in her tenure as Secretary of State that she would serve only four years can be read in the context of a progressive disease that was known as she assumed the post.It is the premise of this discussion the HRC is most likely suffering from Parkinson s Disease (PD).It explains every one of the items listed above. Further, since it is a diagnosis primarily made by observation, the video record is sufficient to create a high degree of certainty.Via: Danger and Play   h/t Gateway Pundit",left-news,"Aug 12, 2016"

5218," Republican Congressman Rejects Trump In Scathing Open Letter, Will Vote For Hillary","The GOP tent continues to get smaller as the first House Republican has decided to vote for Hillary Clinton against the divisive Donald Trump.New York GOP Rep. Richard Hanna, unlike many of his Republican colleagues, has a conscience. Therefore, he can t hold his nose and support the Republican nominee.Many Republicans continue to support Trump even though he has made blatantly racist comments and preached hate on the campaign trail. But Hanna has had enough.In an open letter written for Syracuse.com, Hanna ripped Trump:Months ago I publicly said I could never support Trump. My reasons were simple and personal. I found him profoundly offensive and narcissistic but as much as anything, a world-class panderer, anything but a leader. Little more than a changing mirror of those he speaks to. I never expect to agree with whoever is president, but at a minimum the president needs to consistently display those qualities I have preached to my two children: kindness, honesty, dignity, compassion and respect.I do not expect perfection, but I do require more than the embodiment of at least a short list of the seven deadly sins.Then Hanna slammed the Republican Party for alienating a large swath of Americans while becoming incapable of nominating a candidate who is electable:I have long held the belief that the Republican Party is becoming increasingly less capable of nominating a person who is electable as president. The primary process is so geared toward the party s political base, which ignores the fact that we have largely alienated women, Hispanics, the LGBT community, young voters and many others in general.Hanna went on to call Trump  deeply flawed  and blasted him for the way he has treated John McCain and for the way he is treating Humayun Khan s family now. Hanna is ashamed that his party continues to still support Trump even though he is insulting military families and veterans across the country.And that why he is throwing his support   and most importantly, his vote -to Hillary Clinton.Secretary Clinton has issues that depending on where one stands can be viewed as great or small. But she stands and has stood for causes bigger than herself for a lifetime. That matters. Mrs. Clinton has promoted many of the issues I have been committed to over the years including expanding education and supporting women s health care.While I disagree with her on many issues, I will vote for Mrs. Clinton. I will be hopeful and resolute in my belief that being a good American who loves his country is far more important than parties or winning and losing. I trust she can lead. All Republicans may not like the direction, but they can live to win or lose another day with a real candidate. Our response to the public s anger and the need to rebuild requires complex solutions, experience, knowledge and balance. Not bumper sticker slogans that pander to our disappointment, fear and hate.Now that one Republican in Congress has the balls to vote for Hillary in rejection of Trump, how many others will do the same?Featured image via Sara D.

But her campaign announced Friday night that the trip was being put off for a week, as there were protests in the city for a fourth consecutive night.  Hillary is grateful for, and intends to honor, the invitation from faith leaders to visit with the Charlotte community,  according to Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri.  After further discussion with community leaders, we have decided to postpone Sunday s trip as to not impact the City s resources.

Most people do not realize this, but today most members of Congress are actually millionaires.

It is well past time to put an end to the cronyism and deceit that has transformed Washington into a graveyard of good intentions.

Three young men from North Africa were arrested on Saturday in the western German city of Dortmund for stoning two transgender women.According to a report on Friday on television station SAT1.NRW, the men attacked Yasmine und Elisa, two transgender women, near the city s main train station. Within seconds we were tossed around and they took stones from a gravel bed on the corner and threw them at us,  said Elisa.A police car appeared at the train station as the stoning attack unfolded and arrested the men.The German media as a general rule do not disclose the last names of victims to protect their privacy. The three men are between 16 and 18 years-old and are known to the authorities from theft and assault arrests.Dortmund police official Kim-Ben Freigang said the suspects told the police that  such persons must be stoned. Yasmine installed a security camera at the residence where she lives with Elisa after the attacks.  That was barbaric what they did. They are barbarians,  Yasmine said.She added that she could not believe that such an act of shamelessness occurred.  In 2016, in Germany, with stoning!  According to the SATI.NRW report, Yasmine said it was the first time in 30 years she felt unsafe as a transgender woman.According to Yasmine and Elisa, the three young men propositioned them, but after they realized that Yasmine and Elisa are transgender women, they attacked them with stones.Stoning people to death is a penalty used in nine Muslim-majority countries. In November, a criminal court in Iran s northern province of Gilan sentenced a woman to be executed by stoning for alleged complicity in the murder of her husband, Arash Babaieepour Tabrizinejad.

1940, Intel Committee Member: ‘Innocent People Don’t Ask For Immunity’ (VIDEO),"Michael Flynn drove another nail into the coffin of Donald Trump s presidency on Thursday when he agreed to testify about Russia in exchange for immunity. This prompted one member of the House Intelligence Committee to state the obvious:  Innocent people don t ask for immunity. Speaking to MSNBC s Chris Hayes, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) said what we have all been thinking since the announcement was made that Flynn was willing to testify in exchange for immunity. If you didn t do anything wrong, then you don t need immunity. The only reason to seek immunity is to protect yourself from prosecution from the illegal crap you ve done. Innocent people don t ask for immunity, but that s not something that I m familiar with in our investigation. If he has something to say and he s not worried about what he did, he should just come forward and testify in a public setting,  Swalwell added.Hayes argued that there might be some scenarios where an innocent person would ask for immunity. The MSNBC host said that asking for immunity doesn t automatically mean you are guilty of something. What if they are worried about perjury? Or concerned that maybe their words could somehow be used against them in some other way? Hey, it s possible, right?Swalwell wasn t having it. He said that prosecutors don t run around seeking perjury charges because somebody had a lapse of memory. But this isn t the case when it comes to Flynn, he explained.  What we have here is a pattern of deceit with Michael Flynn.

1595, Bombshell Reports Confirm What We Already Believed About MSNBC’s Joe And Mika (DETAILS),"For the last ten years, Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski have been co-hosts on MSNBC s Morning Joe. They have often seemed a little too chummy, and it has long been speculated that the two were an item. However, both were also married to other people. Scarborough got divorced from his wife in 2013, and Brzezinki was officially free in 2016. To that end, it seems that now that we are in 2017, a respectable enough amount of time has passed to where they can go ahead and confirm the public s belief that they were more than co-hosts.It is now being reported that the two are not only an item, but are actually engaged to be married. This comes after a bizarre round of  congratulations  on the Thursday edition of the show. Of course, the duo s guests said the congratulatory sentiments were about  ratings,  but now we know that it was about upcoming nuptials. The news comes courtesy of the New York Post s Emily Smith, who writes: We re told Scarborough, 54, got down on one knee and proposed at the scenic Bar Bellini at the Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in Antibes, which has a breathtaking moonlit outdoor terrace overlooking the Mediterranean Sea. Now, think what you want of Mika and Joe   I personally have mixed feelings and a bit of a love/hate relationship with Morning Joe   but at least they are finally being honest with the public and their fans. It could be just a bit scandalous, because if they are engaged so soon after Mika s divorce, obviously there was an affair happening while either one or both of them were still married.Of course, these days scandalous affairs are pretty routine for celebrities, though they are supposedly news people   or, at the very least, pundits   so who knows how the network will handle it.There have been no public statements on the announcement from Joe, Mika, or MSNBC as of this writing.Featured image via Frederick M.

9785,Jared Kushner NEVER Registered To Vote As A “Female”…Media Lie BACKFIRES…Shines Bright Light On How Easily Voter Fraud Can Occur,"Meanwhile, as President Trump continues to meet resistance from blue states in his effort to clean up voter fraud, one of his most vocal opponents is none other than the Democrat governor of New York, the same state where the board of elections made the mistake of changing Kushner s identity to a  female  AFTER he registered as a  male . It seems like this may be just the high-profile screw-up the White House has been waiting for in order to revisit the legitimacy of voter rolls in New York.NY refuses to perpetuate the myth voter fraud played a role in our election. We will not comply with this request.https://t.co/eQC6ORV0v1  Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) June 30, 2017Kushner, President Trump s son-in-law, and senior adviser did in fact list himself as a male in his New York voter registration   but an elections database error led to him getting listed as a female.Kushner s supposed registration as a woman, which made headlines Wednesday, is actually a data entry error that the New York Board of Elections corrected only after it became public.A Wired story first reported that Kushner   whose father-in-law has been waging a fact-challenged war on voter fraud   was registered as a woman on his publicly accessible New York State voter information.   NYDaily NewsThe Wired story that was written by Ashley Feinberg suggests one of the reasons Kushner registered to vote as a female may be attributed to him committing voter fraud, which according to Feinberg,  would, of course, would be interesting, considering that Trump s White House has been fixated on allegations that rampant voter fraud took place during the 2016 election. The Huffington Post used the fake news story to prove that Jared Kushner is not capable of brokering peace in the Middle East. Here is their headline for an article written by Amanda Terkel:From the Huffington Post article:If people weren t already skeptical that Kushner   a man who inherited his father s real estate empire and has no policy experience in the Middle East or elsewhere   could achieve the impossible, recent developments may give further pause.He registered to vote as a woman.Radical leftist and (sometimes) comedian Jimmy Kimmel did an entire skit on Jared Kushner registering to vote as a  female.

Given the incompetence of our government agencies, one would think CNN would give Kushner the benefit of the doubt, but alas, giving anyone close to President Donald J.

Gooden, who played football at Mizzou, said the kids knew about the Jason Stockley decision. I felt like it was a good teaching moment for me to circle the team and have a meeting,  he said.Watch:Here are just a few shocking statistics the coach could have shared with his players about neighboring E. St. Louis, IL:WND- Before Ferguson exploded in reaction to the August shooting of black teen Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson, the St. Louis police chief raised eyebrows when he called for the use of drones to monitor high-crime areas.The proposal was a response to what St. Louis police authorities called  subhuman, antisocial, urban terrorist  behavior by criminals.St. Louis also is homeof the notorious  Knockout Game,  a random but racially motivated assault that has claimed at least six lives.St. Louis is 44 percent white and 49 percent black, but statistics shows a racial imbalance in crime. Based on the city s official crime data for 2012   the most recent year which data are available   97.6 percent of those arrested for murder were black and 2.4 percent were white. More than 82 percent of those arrested for serious crimes like murder, aggravated assault and larceny were black, while just 17.5 percent arrested were white.Black males in St. Louis were responsible for the vast majority (63.5 percent) of crimes committed. Other groups contribute significantly less to the serious crimes in St. Louis. White males made up 17 percent of arrests, black females were 14 percent of arrests and white females only 5.3 percent of arrests.There are other strange imbalances in arrests: Black females were arrested for 14 murders compared with three white males arrested for murder. Black females were arrested for more robberies, aggravated assaults and larcenies than white males.These are just a few of the lowlights in a city on the verge of becoming, as U.S. News said, the most dangerous city in America.Consider one violent night in St. Louis last June when 18 people were shot in seven different shootings. Bloody Night Leaves Many in St. Louis Outraged  read one headline.However, some of the shooting victims were not outraged enough to cooperate with law enforcement. St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay described the  no snitchin  mentality of many crime victims: These are disputes, and there are victims who won t talk to the police,  the mayor said.  Trying to make an arrest isn t that simple. In one case, they ve got (multiple) people shot and not one of them would identify the shooter. Slay remarked,  In the vast majority of these cases, people are using their guns to settle their own petty feuds, and that s really what s very unfortunate and outrageous about this. Local news reported on a shooting in a housing complex involving an AK-47 in which  a black male armed with the AK-47 came around the corner [and] started shooting  at an 18-year-old woman and four of her friends.Juanita Sparks, 60, of St. Louis told reporters,  I am tired of thugs. Colin Gordon, author of  Mapping Decline: St. Louis and the Fate of the American City,  calls St. Louis  the poster child of white flight.  However, middle- and upper-middle class blacks are also leaving the city in significant numbers.The Cahokia football coach, who had the perfect opportunity to educate these young minds about getting a good education and staying away from a dead-end life of crime, instead, took the opportunity to disrespect the law enforcement officers tasked with protecting these crime-ridden neighborhoods.  The coach said he spoke to them about that and other situations that have happened in our country. He then explained why former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick started kneeling during the anthem.

7738, Even Staunch Republican Ben Stein Says He’d Support Sanders Or Clinton Over Trump (VIDEO),"Conservatives are going to be seriously shocked about this one.Ben Stein is a conservative economist who served as a speechwriter under Presidents Nixon and Ford in the 1970s, and he s been a Republican his entire life as well as a harsh critic of President Obama.Stein has always supported the Republican nominee in every election, so one would think he would do the same in 2016, especially since President Obama s former Secretary of State is running. Not so fast.Like other Republicans, Stein is troubled by Donald Trump. And after being asked who he would support during an interview on CNN, Stein professed that he could see himself supporting Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, the two Democrats in the race, because Trump is dangerous. I went to law school with Ms. Clinton so I ve always had a kind of fondness for her, she was always a very nice young woman. I admire the fact that Bernie Sanders has a single-payer national health plan. When I worked for Mr. Nixon as a speechwriter, I wrote the message that sent up Mr. Nixon s proposal for single-payer health plan. But I would like to see it be a Republican, I ve never voted for a Democrat. But Mr. Trump, I think, is dangerously misinformed. I like him, but he s dangerously misinformed. Here s the video via YouTube:This is an explosive sign that Republicans are in a hell of a lot of trouble if Donald Trump manages to capture the GOP nomination, which he is well on track to achieving. Trump s nasty and hateful rhetoric and association with members of the KKK and other white supremacist groups is terrifying the GOP establishment because it could not only cause Republicans to lose another presidential election, it could doom their effort to keep the House and the Senate from falling into Democratic control.To underscore that point, NBC s Chuck Todd reported on Tuesday night that a sitting Republican Senator is preparing to endorse Hillary Clinton if Trump wins the nomination.Clearly, Donald Trump is ripping the Republican Party to pieces and it sounds like it s only going to get more entertaining as election season continues.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"March 2, 2016"
21261,UNIVERSITY WARNS: Make Sure Your Holiday Party Is Not A “Christmas Party” In Disguise,"They wouldn t want to remind anyone the actual reason for the  holiday  season or God forbid, give some crazy Muslim terrorist an excuse to come in and shoot the place up The University of Tennessee, Knoxville Office of Diversity and Inclusion has come up with a list of  best practices  in order to ensure your  inclusive  workplace holiday party is  not a Christmas party in disguise  and that it refrains from being perceived as  endorsing religion generally. The  Best Practices for Inclusive Holiday Celebrations in the Workplace  holiday resource guide states that the public university  does not have an official policy regarding religious and cultural d cor and celebration in the workplace,  however,  we are fully committed to a diverse, welcoming, and inclusive environment. In order to  ensure your holiday party is not a Christmas party in disguise,  the Office of Diversity and Inclusion has come up with a list of ways for supervisors to encourage individuals to celebrate their own religions and cultures without allegedly excluding anyone or even being seen as  endorsing religion :Holiday parties and celebrations should celebrate and build upon workplace relationships and team morale with no emphasis on religion or culture. Ensure your holiday party is not a Christmas party in disguise.Consider having a New Year s party and include d cor and food from multiple religions and cultures. Use it as an opportunity to reinvigorate individuals for the New Year s goals and priorities. Supervisors and managers should not as well as, not be perceived as endorsing religion generally or a specific religion.If an individual chooses not to participate in a holiday party or celebration, do not pressure the person to participate. Participation should be voluntary.If a potluck-style party or celebration is planned, encourage employees to bring food items that reflect their personal religions, cultures, and celebrations. Use this as an opportunity for individuals to share what they brought and why it is meaningful to them.If sending holiday cards to campus and community partners, send a non-denominational card or token of your gratitude.Holiday parties and celebrations should not play games with religious and cultural themes. For example,  Dreidel  or  Secret Santa.  If you want to exchange gifts, then refer to it in a general way, such as a practical joke gift exchange or secret gift exchange.D cor selection should be general, not specific to any religion or culture. Identify specific dates when d cor can be put up and when it must come down.Refreshment selection should be general, not specific to any religion or culture.Most importantly, celebrate your religious and cultural holidays in ways that are respectful and inclusive of our students, your colleagues, and our university.

21305,WOW! DEMOCRATS Offer Tips On How To Convince Friends Christians Are More Likely To Commit Acts Of Terrorism Than Muslims,"When we found this insane article on the Occupy Democrats website, it had over 500,000 shares. Obviously, making the case against Christians being more likely to commit terrorism while defending terrorism by Muslims is of utmost interest to the Democrat party. We have gone through each and every example of Christian  terrorism  they have given and dispelled every single one of them. Please make sure you share this article with everyone you know. We are in an emotional propaganda war with the Left and we will not win if we don t fight back with the facts. The outpouring of blatant Islamophobia and barely disguised racism coming from the right-wing in the wake of the Paris attacks is utterly despicable. Every time one of these attacks happen, conservatives insist on blaming the world s 1.6 billion Muslims for their complicity, even though the majority of terrorist attacks are carried out against Muslim. American far right-wingers like Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) are calling for religious profiling of incoming refugees, because somehow being a Christian automatically removes the risk of terrorism   even though Christian right-wing terrorists in America have killed more people since 9/11 than Muslim terrorists have.Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee even had the sheer gall to tell conservative blowhard Joe Scarborough that  I don t know of any other group of people uniquely that are targeting innocent civilians and committing these acts of mayhem.  Warmonger (from the party who has kept us at war with the same countries we were fighting with, and added a few since Obama took office) and avowed (avowed?) bigot (bigot?) Ted Cruz said that  there is no meaningful risk of Christians committing acts of terror. If there were a group of radical Christians pledging to murder anyone who had a different religious view than they, we would have a different national security situation.  Since both grifters seem to have severe selective memory problems, let s take a look at the worst Christian terrorist attacks that our own citizens have perpetrated within our borders.1. The Knoxville Unitarian Universalist Church ShootingOne of Adkisson s former wives was a member of the church he attacked. Following his heinous attack of the church members, he had this to say about the attack in his manifesto (Please note, there is never any mention of RELIGION in his reasoning for the attack. His attack was about punishing Democrats (liberals) for destroying America: Adkisson stated that he had targeted the church because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country, and that he felt that the Democrats had tied his country s hands in the war on terror and they had ruined every institution in America with the aid of major media outlets. Adkisson made statements that because he could not get to the leaders of the liberal movement that he would then target those that had voted them into office. Adkisson stated that he had held these beliefs for about the last ten years. Adkisson s manifesto[10] also cited the inability to find a job, and that his food stamps were being cut. Here is a screen shot of his manifesto listing all 3 reasons he committed this horrible crime against innocent people. We are not condoning his behavior, we are simply exposing the lies of this Democrat publication who would attempt to frame this act of violence as being motivated by Christianity:Jim David Adkisson, a devout Christian and anti-abortion right-winger, walked into a Knoxville church on July 27th, 2008, and began firing a shotgun at children who were performing Annie Jr. He killed two and wounded seven, targeting  the church because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country. 2. The Campaign of Terror Against Abortion DoctorsThis article references the well-known case of abortionist killer, Scott Roeder. We d like to set the record straight about how desire to take the life of abortionist, George Tiller was really about workplace violence and had NOTHING to do with Christianity.Abortion lovers were clearly salivating when word got out that a man walked into George  Tiller The Killer s  former abortion facility with a bomb in his backpack earlier this week. It turns out that, in fact, the guy was looking for a job, like so many Americans under Obamistake. He wanted to be a canvasser for Live Fetal Organ Dispensary Inc., otherwise known as Planned Parenthood.The media-reported bomb was, in fact, a pill bottle-sized firework. No one was harmed, thank God, but the incident is just one of a too-long string of MSM bigotry against conservatives.In 1993, Dr. Richard Gunn was shot dead by an anti-abortion protester. In 1994, Drs. John Britton and James Barrett were shot to death by Reverend Paul Jennings. In 1998, Dr. Barnett Sleipan was shot dead in his home by a Christian terrorist. In 2009, Dr. George Tiller was shot by Scott Roeder in a church. The ability for Christian right-wingers to justify cold-blooded murder in the name of their pro-life beliefs is a colossal hypocrisy worthy of a terrorist group like ISIS. According to the National Abortion Federation, there have been 17 attempted murders, 383 death threats, 153 incidents of assault or battery, 13 wounded, 100 butyric acid attacks, 373 physical invasions, 41 bombings, 655 anthrax threats, and 3 kidnappings committed against abortion providers since 1977. Terrorist groups like the Taliban and ISIS are very fond of acid attacks and chemical weapons like anthrax; apparently Christian right-wing terrorists share that same preference.3. The 1995 Oklahoma City Bombings(Note, there is no mention of Christianity in McVeigh s explanation of why he bombed the Murrah Fed Building.)In Timothy McVeigh s own words:I explain herein why I bombed the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. I explain this not for publicity, nor seeking to win and argument of right or wrong. I explain so that the record is clear as to my thinking and motivations in bombing a government installation. I chose to bomb a federal building because such an action served more purposes than other options. Foremost, the bombing was a retaliatory strike; a counter attack, for the cumulative raids (and subsequent violence and damage) that federal agents had participated in over the preceding years (including, but not limited to, Waco.) From the formation of such units as the FBI s  Hostage Rescue  and other assault teams amongst federal agencies during the  80 s; culminating in the Waco incident, federal actions grew increasingly militaristic and violent, to the point where at Waco, our government   like the Chinese   was deploying tanks against its own citizens.Knowledge of these multiple and ever-more aggressive raids across the country constituted an identifiable pattern of conduct within and by the federal government and amongst its various agencies. (see enclosed) For all intents and purposes, federal agents had become  soldiers  (using military training, tactics, techniques, equipment, language, dress, organization, and mindset) and they were escalating their behavior. Therefore, this bombing was also meant as a pre-emptive (or pro-active) strike against these forces and their command and control centers within the federal building. When an aggressor force continually launches attacks from a particular base of operation, it is sound military strategy to take the fight to the enemy.Additionally, borrowing a page from U.S. foreign policy, I decided to send a message to a government that was becoming increasingly hostile, by bombing a government building and the government employees within that building who represent that government. Bombing the Murrah Federal Building was morally and strategically equivalent to the U.S. hitting a government building in Serbia, Iraq, or other nations. (see enclosed) Based on observations of the policies of my own government, I viewed this action as an acceptable option. From this perspective, what occurred in Oklahoma City was no different than what Americans rain on the heads of others all the time, and subsequently, my mindset was and is one of the clinical detachment. (the bombing of the Murrah building was not personal , no more than when Air Force, Army, Navy, or Marine personnel bomb or launch cruise missiles against government installations and their personnel.)I hope that this clarification amply addresses your question.Sincerely,  Timothy J. McVeigh  USP Terre Haute (IN)Timothy McVeigh, America s most notorious domestic terrorist, was obsessed with the Seventh-Day Aventist splinter group known as the Branch Davidians, who resisted an ATF raid on their citadel at Mount Carmel in 1993. He travelled to Waco, Texas during the Waco Siege and heavily supported the religious extremists within it. Two years later, he detonated a fertilizer bomb at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing a hundred and sixty-eight people, including nineteen children, and wounded 648 others. This Christian specifically targeted innocent civilians and committed horrific acts of violence to make his political point heard   something Mr. Huckabee believes he should be incapable of, since he s not a Muslim.4. Everything The Ku Klux Klan Has Ever Done(The KKK was not founded on Christian principles and actually changed their focus in the second wave of the KKK to addressing the supposed threat of the Catholic Church, using anti-Catholicism and nativism. Its appeal was directed exclusively at white Protestants; it opposed Jews, blacks, Catholics, and newly arriving Southern European groups such as Italians.)Since its creation after the American Civil War, the Ku Klux Klan has been terrorizing Americans in the name of Protestantism and racial purity. Known for their terrifying costumes and hoods, they wrought have fear and violence against blacks, Jews, immigrants, gays, and Catholics for hundreds of years, responsible for countless massacres, lynchings, rapes, and bombings that have killed thousands. In the modern day, it still has a membership of 5,000 to 8,000 terrorists that operate in individual chapters. Just two weeks ago, Frazier Glenn Cross, the leader of the Carolina Knights of the KKK, was sentenced to death by lethal injection for murdering a fourteen year old girl and two seniors outside the Overland Park Jewish Community Center in Kansas City. The man gave the Hitler salute during his trial and declared that  Jews are destroying the white race.  None of his victims were Jewish.5. The Massacre At Zion Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C.(Maybe we missed it, but as far as we can tell, this attack had nothing to do with the attacker being a Christian. Liberal logic however, makes it okay to blame this heinous act on Christianity even though the VICTIMS were the CHRISTIANS in this case.)On Wednesday, June 17th of this year, a man rose from a pew in the historically black Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, SC, and opened fire with a .45 caliber pistol, killing nine worshipers, including pastor and State Senator Clementa Pickiney. The shooter has been photographed wearing patches representing the racist apartheid regimes in Southwest Africa, had a Confederate license plate on his vehicle. All signs points to this being a hate crime- not only is it the oldest black church in the South, it was a symbol of resistance against slavery, and a survivor reported that the shooter yelled  I have to do it. You rape our women and you re taking over our country. And you have to go.  Roof was a member of a local Lutheran church, yet somehow his baptism didn t prevent him from gunning down innocent people in a house of worship, defiling a sacred place with hate and murder.So the next time one of your conservative friends tries to  school  you on the  evils of Islam,  just name a couple items from this list. The rampant xenophobia that has taken hold of the Republican Party is an affront to everything this nation stands for. Terrorism spawns from the desperation of humankind, and for that, we are all guilty.The original article was published by Occupy Democrats on November 17, 2015 and is titled:  The Top Five Attacks On America Committed By Christian Terrorists, Not Muslims ",left-news,"Nov 22, 2015"
10709,ALARMING: NSA Refuses to Release Clinton-Lynch Tarmac Transcript with Lame Excuse,"If Clinton and Lynch just talked about grandkids then why is this such a top secret transcript? This is troubling because it portends to what we ve known all along Bill Clinton was meeting with Lynch to fight Hillary s battle. They won t reveal it because it would implicate so many people in government Are we right?A citizen researcher from Florida is attempting to have the recording of the infamous Bill Clinton/Loretta Lynch tarmac tape released to the public, but apparently, the National Security Agency claims they won t release it due to  national security. The man researching and seeking to have the tape released is Florida orthodontist Larry Kawa. You may remember him because of Judicial Watch s filing of a lawsuit on his behalf to obtain a week s worth of Hillary Clinton s emails regarding Benghazi.It s being reported now that the NSA has declared the recording of the conversation that took place between Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch in Phoenix, Arizona on June 27, 2016.Judicial Watch filed a Freedom of Information Act request in March of this year to obtain the following:Any and all records and/or transcripts of a meeting held between Attorney General Loretta lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 28, 2016.Any and all records of communication sent to or from officials in the Office of the Attorney General regarding the meeting held between Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 28, 2016.Any and all records of communication sent to or from officials in the Office of the Deputy Attorney General regarding the meeting held between Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 28, 2016.Any and all references to the meeting held between Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton contained in day planners, calendars and schedules in the Office of theAttorney General. This brings us to Kawa. In an article at Big League Politics, Patrick Howley writes:The National Security Agency (NSA) blocked the release of a purported tape of Bill Clinton and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch s private airplane talk with a rare legal justification used to protect top national security secrets.The NSA s block of the release of this information   citing one of President Obama s executive orders   undercuts Hillary Clinton s claim that her husband and Lynch had a  purely social  conversation about grandkids and golf on June 27, 2016, two weeks before Lynch dropped the Department of Justice investigation into Hillary Clinton s email scandal.Read more: Freedom Outpost",politics,"Jun 3, 2017"
17590,NBC MANAGEMENT “Protected The Sh*t Out of Him”: Details of Married Matt Lauer’s Disgusting Acts Of Sexual Harassment Are REVEALED After Democrat Fan Boy Is Fired,"NBC was called out by conservative news outlets, like Breitbart for refusing to disclose Matt Lauer s ties to the Clinton Foundation prior to his 30 minutes during NBC s  Commander-in-Chief forum  where he basically ignored every Hillary scandal during his interview with her. The longtime Today Show co-host had ties to the Clinton Foundation. Lauer was once listed as a  notable member  of The Clinton Global Initiative, the fundraising conduit of the scandal-ridden Clinton Foundation.Today, another close friend of the Clinton s saw his career as the highest paid morning host come to an abrupt end over sexual misconduct and assault allegations, as NBC announced that Matt Lauer had been fired from the Today Show.  Variety spoke with 10 past and present workers at the company who accused Lauer of a vast array of sexual misconduct, including the woman who claims that she was sexually assaulted by the show s long-time anchor beginning in 2014 at the Sochi Olympics.That woman also shared her account with the human resources and legal departments of NBC News on Monday.NBC launched an investigation into her claims on Tuesday morning which ultimately led to Lauer s firing that same evening. That swift response was still not enough for some women however, who said their complaints to executives at the company fell on deaf ears.Those interviewed said it was at the OIympic Games where Lauer made moves on a number of female staff members. Lauer would invite women employed by NBC late at night to his hotel room while covering the Olympics in various cities over the years,  claims Variety reporter Ramin Setoodeh. He later told colleagues how his wife had accompanied him to the London Olympics because she didn t trust him to travel alone.  None of the 10 individuals who spoke with Variety are identified in the piece, including the woman who got the sex toy along with  an explicit note about how he wanted to use it on her. That woman said she was  mortified,  while a fellow co-worker s state was described as  visibly shaken  after Lauer allegedly flashed her in his office.When she did not do anything, Lauer reportedly  reprimanded her for not engaging in a sexual act. His office was in a secluded space, and he had a button under his desk that allowed him to lock his door from the inside without getting up,  writes Setoodeh. This afforded him the assurance of privacy. It allowed him to welcome female employees and initiate inappropriate contact while knowing nobody could walk in on him. That information came courtesy of two of the women who spoke with the writer of the piece. He couldn t sleep around town with celebrities or on the road with random people because he s Matt Lauer and he s married. So he d have to do it within his stable, where he exerted power, and he knew people wouldn t ever complain. While not named, one woman, in particular, seemed to catch Lauer s eye according to thse interviewed for the piece. Several employees recall how he paid intense attention to a young woman on his staff that he found attractive, focusing intently on her career ambitions,  reads the story. And he asked the same producer to his hotel room to deliver him a pillow. Lauer s fixation on women s bodies and physical appearance is also a big part of the story, with multiple people saying that he would often play the game  F***, Marry or Kill  with staffers.One of the show s anchors would often gossip about Lauer s sexual escapades according to staffers while a former reporter said:  Management sucks there.

984," OOPS: Hypocrite Trump Accuses Amazon Of Not Paying Taxes, Except They Do","Donald Trump just posted a provable lie on Twitter that makes him look like a complete hypocrite.In retaliation against the Washington Post for correctly reporting that Trump is displaying fake Time magazine covers of himself at his golf resorts, Trump attacked the Post as  fake news  and took aim at Amazon, which owns the Post, seemingly threatening the Internet giant and accusing it of not paying their taxes.The #AmazonWashingtonPost, sometimes referred to as the guardian of Amazon not paying internet taxes (which they should) is FAKE NEWS!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 28, 2017Not only is there no such thing as  internet taxes,  Newsweek pointed out that if Trump is somehow referencing Amazon s legal battle to not pay state sales taxes he is spreading fake news because Amazon lost in court and has been paying sales taxes in the 45 states that have a sales tax ever since.The president may be referring to Amazon s years-long fight against paying state sales taxes. But Amazon lost that battle, and recently has been adding states where it does pay sales tax.Amazon now pays sales tax in all 45 states that have a sales tax. On April 1, Amazon began collecting sales taxes in Hawaii, Idaho, Maine and New Mexico, the last four holdouts. Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon do not have a state sales tax.If Trump was, in fact, referring to sales tax in his tweet, the tweet is fake news.Trump s tweet also smacks of hypocrisy since he actually does not pay his taxes. Trump has refused to release his tax returns and the only tax return we have seen shows that Trump may not have had to pay federal income taxes for two decades after he wrote off a $900 million business loss.Furthermore, Trump is currently suing the town of Briarcliff Manor, New York in an effort to force the town to cut the property taxes on his $38 million Westchester golf course and resort. Trump currently pays just $500,000, but he is trying to pay only half that amount by devaluing the worth of his own property despite bragging that it was worth $50 million on his 2016 financial disclosure forms.Trump has been disputing the taxes in court for years even though the town already gave him a generous tax break in 2008. Childishly, Trump sends a check every year marked  Paid Under Protest. Donald Trump is a hypocrite who lies through his teeth. And by attacking Amazon and the Washington Post, he is attacking Jeff Bezos, who just so happens to be a member of Trump s own American Technology Council. That will probably change soon.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"June 28, 2017"
210, Trump HUMILIATED As WH Walks Back His Attack After Soldier’s Mom Confirms His Insensitive Phone Call,"Donald Trump is having another bad day.Earlier this week, Trump finally contacted the family of one of the four American soldiers who were killed in Niger.Unfortunately, Trump was an asshole. He knew what he signed up for, but I guess it hurts anyway,  Trump told Army Sgt. La David Johnson s widow Myeshia over the phone while she and the rest of Johnson s family were meeting his flag-draped coffin.Florida Democratic Rep. Frederica Wilson passed her account of Trump s insensitive words to the media. She was crying the whole time, and when she hung up the phone, she looked at me and said,  He didn t even remember his name.  That s the hurting part,  Wilson told MSNBC.  He was almost like joking. He said,  Well, I guess you knew    something to the effect that  he knew what he was getting into when he signed up, but I guess it hurts anyway.  You know, just matter-of-factly, that this is what happens, anyone who is signing up for military duty is signing up to die. That s the way we interpreted it. It was horrible. It was insensitive. It was absolutely crazy, unnecessary. I was livid. On Wednesday morning, Trump attacked Wilson and accused her of lying. Trump even claimed to have proof.Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2017As it turns out, Wilson has witnesses, including Johnson s own grieving mother, who confirmed Wilson s account to the Washington Post. President Trump did disrespect my son and my daughter and also me and my husband,  Cowanda Jones-Johnson said. She went on to confirm that Wilson s account was accurate.Faced with real proof, the White House was forced to walk back Trump s attack. This president cares deeply,  a White House official told the Sentinel.  Maybe he said something that was misunderstood, but he certainly cares about fallen servicemen and women. In short, the White House just basically confirmed that Donald Trump acted like an asshole toward Johnson s family, and also that Rep. Wilson was telling the truth.Trump owes her and Johnson s family a very public apology.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"October 18, 2017"
20952,ALL HELL IS ABOUT TO BREAK LOOSE Between European Vigilante Group “Soldiers Of Odin” And ISIS Inspired “Soldiers Of Allah”,"European nations have naively opened their borders to millions of Muslim males who have no intention of assimilating. As they make their way across Europe, police forces find themselves ill-equipped to handle the extreme increase in sexual assault and violence, so citizens are now finding themselves in a position where they are being forced to take matters into their own hands.A group of young concerned Germans made a video warning that they would no longer sit back and watch their culture and history being destroyed. The video can be viewed by clicking HERE.On February 4, 2015, we reported about a fast growing group of vigilantes who call themselves the  Soldiers of Odin. The self-styled  Soldiers of Odin  march in a mob, wearing bomber jackets with their logo on the back. They have vowed to take direct action to  protect their wives, girlfriends and children  after a migrant influx to the liberal Scandinavian country. Persons linked to Islamist groups in Oslo say that they have formed a group called  Soldiers of Allah .Via a central source in the Islamist environment, the Norwegian newspaper VG has received a statement, and photographs of the planned uniform.The group has been named  Jundullaah    which translates to  Soldiers of Allah . In response to the group of unbelievers in Soldiers of Odin, who are patrolling the streets, we Muslims have chosen to create a group to patrol the streets, initially in the capital Oslo, to forbid evil and call for the good,  says the statement.The planned  uniform , is decorated with the black flag of the terrorist organization Islamic State (IS) on the back, with a small logo on the chest.On Tuesday, Labour s Muslim deputy chairman, Hadia Tajik, said that the Soldiers of Odin defy Norway s rules on private security businesses and she tried to illustrate the problem as follows:  It is as if the Islamists would be the uniformed ones, take to the streets and call themselves guards or vigilantes. It is very undesirable and unfortunate for our country, devastating, said Tajik.Now it s exactly what is about to happen.Great tip, Tajik.The information that Islamists in Oslo are in the process of establishing a group, is also confirmed by the temporary spokesman of the Prophet s ummah who calls himself  Abu Arijon.  He said that the plan is to start in Oslo, then Drammen and T nsberg.Many of the people in  Soldiers of Allah  come from the environment around the Islamist group the Prophet s Ummah, where spokesman Ubaydullah Hussain currently is in custody and charged with recruiting for IS. Soldiers of Allah  inform in the statement themselves, that almost everyone in the group is on the  Watch List  of the Police Security Service (PST).  Is PST aware of the group  Soldiers of Allah  planning to patrol in Oslo?  We can not comment on individuals or individual groups, says senior adviser in PST, Siv Als n, to VG.So there it is. Regular street battles could soon be a reality in Norway. Soldiers of Odin against Soldiers of Allah, with the police in between. However, it will most likely not be started by the Soldiers of Odin, but the rabid Islamists in the soldiers of Allah. And then, even though the Soldiers of Odin claim to be a peaceful group, the Viking has clearly awaken   illustrated by the logo on the back. And being attacked by Islamists, they will have no other choice than to go berserk again, after a thousand years in hibernation.All hell is breaking loose in countries all across Europe.

3489," New Poll Shows How Batsh** CRAZY Trump Fans Are, Gives Them A BRUTAL Reality Check (IMAGES)","The supporters of President-elect Donald Trump are very much like him   they live in their own little world, completely unaware of how history and the country has progressed. Thanks to a new poll that was recently revealed on MSNBC s  The Rachel Maddow Show  yesterday, we re able to see just how far removed Trump supporters are from reality.According to a recent Public Policy Polling (PPP) poll, Trump and his supports rarely have any grasp or knowledge of basic facts that are only a Google search away   and they don t really care about becoming informed. Maddow highlighted just how off Trump supporters were regarding some of the biggest issues our country has been faced with, and the findings were truly pathetic.It turns out, almost 40 percent of Trump supports truly think that President Barack Obama has caused the stock market to go down. The truth is, the stock market has DOUBLED during Obama s time in the White House:TwitterAnother thing that Trump and his rabid fans like to whine about is the unemployment rate. Despite numerous reports coming out about how Obama has done wonders for the unemployment rate, 67 percent of Trump lovers are saying it has increased. The truth is that in January 2009, the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent   and thanks to Obama, it is now 4.6 percent as of last month.TwitterTrump voters are also very uninformed about Trump s rival, Hillary Clinton   and we can thank Trump himself for that. Clinton s 2.7 million lead over Trump in the popular vote has been broadcast heavily   and yet 40 percent of Trump fans are in complete denial and think she lost! Even worse   60 percent think  millions  of illegal voters contributed to Clinton s win (another rumor that Trump is solely responsible for).TwitterThis is truly depressing, and shows just how much trouble America is in when Trump begins his term and his clueless followers are given even more reason to ignore facts. These polls show just how gullible Trump voters are and how easily they eat up Trump s weird conspiracy theories and fear-driven rhetoric. They ll believe just about anything he says, and now they re just as far removed from reality as he is.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,"December 9, 2016"
18078,"WATCH: SMARTPHONE CAPTURES NEW BOATLOAD OF “Scared, Hungry Women and Children” On Their Way To Europe…While 6.6 MILLION More Are Waiting To Cross","Ask your liberal friends to tell you more about these  poor women and children  who are fleeing persecution from radical Islamists in the Middle East The recent surge of migration into Europe has been unprecedented in scope, with an estimated 1 million migrants from the Middle East and North Africa this past year alone, making for a massive humanitarian crisis, as well as a political and moral dilemma for European governments. But one crucial dimension of this crisis has gone little-noticed: sex or, more technically, sex ratios.According to official counts, a disproportionate number of these migrants are young, unmarried, unaccompanied males. In fact, the sex ratios among migrants are so one-sided we re talking worse than those in China, in some cases that they could radically change the gender balance in European countries in certain age cohorts.  PoliticoA leaked German government report has warned, that up to 6.6 million people are waiting in countries around the Mediterranean to cross into Europe, according to details of the classified report leaked to Bild newspaper.Here s a video that s being circulated on social media today, of a boatload of young, male immigrants who are speaking Arabic as they record their trip on a smartphone. Note to bleeding heart liberals: These are clearly not impoverished men or women and children who are escaping persecution by Islamic extremists.New boatload of scared/hungry women and children on their way to Europe. At least they had their smart phone to document the journey. pic.twitter.com/svLUy6mO9K  Based Monitored   (@BasedMonitored) August 22, 2017The high percentage of young males flooding European countries will soon be a very serious problem:Politico   As many governments, including in the United States, debate how many migrants to accept onto their shores, they would be wise to take gender balance into consideration. That might sound sexist on the surface, but years of research has shown that male-dominated societies are less stable, because they are more susceptible to higher levels of violence, insurgence and mistreatment of women. In Germany, scores of women recently reported being attacked on New Year s Eve by men whom the authorities describe as of  North African or Arabic  descent. While it is not yet known whether the alleged perpetrators were migrants, the attacks may finally be alerting policymakers to the risks of a male-dominated migration wave.Why would European societies, many of which rank highest on global measures of gender equality and stability and peace, jeopardize those hard-won and enviable rankings?That imbalance might not sound radical, but it is, especially when you look more closely at who those males are. It s true that many male migrants hope that, if granted asylum, they will be joined in Europe by their wives and children, who would help balance out national sex ratios. But importantly, more than 20 percent of migrants are minors below the age of 18, and the IOM estimates that more than half of those minors traveling to Europe are traveling as unaccompanied minors 90 percent of whom are males. This heavily male subset is all but guaranteed asylum because of their status as unaccompanied minors, but they get no special dispensation to bring spouses, especially since the European Court of Human Rights recently ruled that European Union countries are not required to recognize the legality of child marriages among migrants.

15702,BREAKING: RUSSIA SMELLS OBAMA’S FOREIGN POLICY WEAKNESS AND MAKES A MOVE,"Leading from behind hasn t worked out so well for Obama and now Russia has taken full advantage of our perceived weakness when it comes to building ties with China and other superpowers. This is  a dangerous game with China and Russia cozying up for military exercises. 2016 can t come soon enough!!!SOCHI, Russia (Reuters)   Russian land forces will join troops from China, India, Mongolia and Belarus in a series of joint military training exercises during the second half of this year, President Vladimir Putin s office said on Wednesday.The announcement, issued as Putin met top Russian military brass in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, will stir unease in Western capitals, whose relations with Moscow have deteriorated sharply during the year-long Ukraine crisis.Moscow has become especially keen to build closer economic and other ties with the Asian giants China and India since the United States and European Union imposed sanctions on Russia last year over its annexation of Ukraine s Crimean region.The joint military training exercises will have a focus on peace-keeping and anti-terrorist activities, the statement said.Training exercises are also planned with troops from member countries of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (ODKB), which includes Russia and several former Soviet republics such as Kazakhstan, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan.Russia also plans a number of other training exercises for its armed forces this year, Wednesday s statement said, part of efforts to counter what Moscow portrays as an aggressive, anti-Russian stance by NATO.Chinese President Xi Jinping and India s President Pranab Mukherjee joined Putin in Moscow last Saturday for a military parade marking the 70th anniversary of the allied victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two in Europe.Western leaders skipped the event in protest over Russian policy in Ukraine.Last week, Xi and Putin signed a $25 billion deal to boost Chinese lending to Russian firms and a host of other economic accords.

14102,OBAMA Is GIVING YOUR Money To Illegal Aliens To Start Businesses…You Won’t Believe Where Those Businesses Are Located [VIDEO],"American citizens are eligible to apply for small business LOANS, but they are also responsible for paying them back with interest. Illegal aliens on the other hand, are getting FREE money from the American taxpayer to start a business with no obligation to pay us back. Oh and there s one more big catch Read the fine print on the Small Business Administration s website, and you ll find that the agency does not provide the funds to  start or grow  a small business   the engine of the American economy, providing roughly three-quarters of all new jobs. Rather, the SBA provides offers loan guarantees to the banks and lenders that do provide seed money. So it might come as a surprise to American entrepreneurs that there is at least one group to whom the federal government is providing direct assistance for business start-ups: illegal aliens. In fact, these recipients of your taxpayer funds fall into an even more restricted category: illegal aliens who have been deported back to their native land.As part of an ongoing project he calls The Waste Report, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has called attention to these outlays, which are made by an obscure federal agency called the Inter-American Foundation (IAF).Housed in a nondescript building a few blocks from the White House, IAF is spending up to $50,000 annually to help Salvadorans sent back to El Salvador to  reintegrate  into their communities, under the idea that doing so will make them less likely to seek to return to the United States.IAF works through a local NGO called INSAMI, which stands for Instituto Salvadore o del Migrante and which estimates that 500 Salvadorans are deported from the U.S. to El Salvador each week. The group says the IAF funds assist sixty Salvadorans a year,  including deportees,  by helping to  facilitate their reintegration into their communities and support their enterprises.  This is accomplished by  offering financial education, technical advice and assistance with business plans,  all of which serves, in turn, to  assure that broader support and resources are available to the migrants, that their abilities are appreciated, their concerns understood and their needs met. IAF did not respond to Fox News  requests for comment. Once we deport them, we set them up in business? It makes no sense to me,  Sen. Paul said in an interview with Fox News.Shawn Moran, vice president of the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC), the union that represents America s 21,000 Border Patrol officers, expressed dismay at learning of the federal outlays to deported illegal aliens.Moran indicated that limited funding has made it exceedingly rare for Border Patrol officers ever to have a partner while they are working along the southern border, often at night   a state of affairs that leaves the officers more vulnerable to assaults by heavily armed alien- and drug-smugglers. He also alluded to equipment shortages that compromise the officers  effectiveness. Agents do not have the tried and true tools that they need to conduct law enforcement operations,  Moran told Fox News. And I think $50,000 could go a long way in one Border Patrol sector to help correct that.  He cited the communications devices the officers rely on.  Agents are using radios that oftentimes, they can see a Border Patrol station from the hills along the border, yet they can t talk to it. So what else might $50,000 of taxpayer funds purchase to secure the border against illegal aliens from El Salvador and elsewhere?A review of help-wanted ads posted online by the federal Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency finds that as recently as April 7, CBP was conducting a search for Border Patrol agents in multiple locations, with the top annual starting salary placed at: $50,600.For that same amount, the federal government could purchase seven Yamaha Grizzly 450 automatic utility all-terrain vehicles like these, of which the federal government purchased fifteen, from a Decatur, Illinois-based motor sports store, in September 2013.Via: FOX News ",politics,"Apr 16, 2016"
247, Conservative Dream Come True: Judge Grants Rapist Joint Custody Of Victim’s Child,"If Republicans have their way, rape victims will continue to be terrorized by their rapists.The victim was only 12 years old when Christopher Mirasolo raped her and impregnated her. Despite also threatening her life, Mirasolo only spent six months in prison, only to spend four more years in prison for sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl.That being said, Mirasolo should NOT be allowed anywhere near a child and should still be rotting in prison.But a Michigan judge has decided that Mirasolo should have joint custody of the child his victim gave birth to eight years ago.According to The Detroit News, county officials surveyed the victim s use of food stamps, aid she relies on to take care of her eight-year-old son.For some reason, the county connected her to Mirasolo and a DNA test was taken. It appears the county was searching for a reason to kick her and her son off the food stamp program so they did all of this without her consent.Well, despite the fact that Mirasolo is the victim s rapist, Sanilac County Circuit Judge Gregory S. Ross gave him joint custody of child, ordered the victim to move back to Michigan, and gave her address to Mirasolo.In other words, Judge Ross just put a woman s life in danger and endangered a child.And by giving Mirasolo joint custody, he is allowing a rapist to continue terrorizing his victim. I think this is all crazy,  the victim told The Detroit News.  They never explained anything to me. I was receiving about $260 a month in food stamps for me and my son and health insurance for him. I guess they were trying to see how to get some of the money back. Her attorney is also rightfully pissed off.This is insane,  attorney Rebecca Kiessling said.  Nothing has been right about this since it was originally investigated. He was never properly charged and should still be sitting behind bars somewhere, but the system is victimizing my client, who was a child herself when this all happened. And the same scenario could play out across the nation if Republicans have their way. House Republicans recently passed a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks and you can be damn sure they will keep trying to ban abortion entirely, with zero exceptions for rape victims. That means rapists will be able to seek joint custody in order to make their victim s lives a living hell. Imagine having to interact with the person who raped you and having to hand your child over to them.It s a terrifying scenario that no rape victim should have to face. Conservatives are constantly telling us that rape victims should carry these pregnancies to term because the baby isn t to blame. But as long as rapists are able to pursue custody and terrorize their victims for the rest of their lives, women should never lose the right to choose. Because no one should be forced to live their life in terror and fear.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"October 7, 2017"

1812," FBI Releases DAMNING Information About Russian Collusion, Trump TERRIFIED","The Washington Post reported Tuesday that former Trump advisor Carter Page was one of the members of the Trump campaign who were monitored by the FBI because of their communications with Russia. As part of an investigation into the campaign that long predates Director James Comey s infamous  Clinton email  letter that helped swing the election in Donald Trump s favor, a judge granted the Bureau s request   a decision that is not made lightly:The FBI and the Justice Department obtained the warrant targeting Carter Page s communications after convincing a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power, in this case Russia, according to the officials.This is the clearest evidence so far that the FBI had reason to believe during the 2016 presidential campaign that a Trump campaign adviser was in touch with Russian agents. Such contacts are now at the center of an investigation into whether the campaign coordinated with the Russian government to swing the election in Trump s favor.Page says that the real story isn t the fire   it s that people reported the fire. This confirms all of my suspicions about unjustified, politically motivated government surveillance,  Page told the Post, failing to mention that a judge would not have granted the warrant if there was not already convincing evidence it was necessary.  I have nothing to hide. Ever since his administration began leaking like a colander, Trump and his crew have been working overtime to convince the American people that the information itself is unimportant (no matter how important it is), that the real problem is that someone is telling us about it.

13602,NOT FUNNY! What These “MORONS” Did For Crooked Hillary Should FRIGHTEN Every American [VIDEO],"It s easy to see why there are so many Americans who would rather keep their heads firmly buried in the sand than know the truth about how inept our government officials really are Hillary Clinton is facing damaging new revelations about the lax security surrounding her emails.Watch Hillary try to make voters believe she is a  victim  in this insane security risk she has subjected our entire nation to:A Daily Mail Online investigation has found that a second firm   hired to store a back-up of Clinton s secret server   was so lax in its security employees failed to change passwords frequently and left computers logged in, unattended for extended periods and its own clients stumbled upon other clients data.Datto Inc, the company in question, was hired to store Hillary s emails by Platte River, the mom-and-pop company contracted to maintain her  homebrew  email system.Speaking exclusively to Daily Mail Online on condition of anonymity, one former employee at Datto, said the company was woefully exposed to being hacked. If you re talking about high-level data security, at the political, presidential level, the security level of data [at Datto] hired by Platte River, was nowhere near something that could have been protected from a good hacker that knows how to spread out their points at which to infiltrate,  he said.The emails emails, 30,000 of which Clinton deleted, are now part of an FBI investigation into her handling of classified material while she was Secretary of State.A total of 22 have been deemed to contain top secret material   out of 2,075 found to contain classified material   and questions have mounted about whether her account was successfully hacked, which the Clinton campaign claims did not happen.The existence of the emails only came to light because of a House investigation into the deaths of four American in an Islamist attack on the mission in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11 2012.The probe concluded this week with an excoriating report by the majority Republican members of the committee, who accused her of  shameful  conduct with her secret email account.Clinton dismissed the report, saying it was time to  move on  and went to California to launch her policies on the tech industry.But now it can be disclosed that Datto Inc is accused of major security failings by people who worked for it and also those who used its services.The failings included allegations that security was so lax that customers warned the firm they had stumbled on other clients  data; that in 2010, the company s internal servers were hacked; and that staff were not required to regularly change passwords, seen as a basic requirement for keeping systems secure.Staff computers   which had access to servers holding confidential client information   were left logged in while unoccupied for extended periods of time, whistleblowers said.And Datto headquarters were easily accessible and had no security guards on their floor, while employees opened and held doors open for others which should only have been accessible with a security pass.A longtime Datto partner, Marc Tamarin, told Daily Mail Online:  Those guys were really morons. They weren t qualified to handle our back-up and that was the biggest concern for us. The former employee speaking exclusively to Daily Mail Online on condition of anonymity, spent three years at Datto, and said the company was woefully exposed to being hacked. It s not something that Datto was focused on. It was more about getting the data off-site quickly and cost-effectively than securing the data and keeping it from being hacked. There s no doubt in my mind that someone could easily hack them   even today. Datto was named last October as the second data storage company to be investigated by the FBI over what threat Clinton s server posed to national security.One of the Datto insiders told Daily Mail Online that around 2010, the startup had its internal network hacked, leading to the authorities being called.

It also makes no sense. He explains that he s the son of Muslim immigrants, and how his family is now told to be careful in how they worship. Also explaining, that as American citizens, that is absolutely awful. We have the freedom of religion in this nation, and everyone has a right to worship how they so choose on their own time.Ansari wrote that despite not being religious himself, even looking like you might be Muslim can make you a target of discrimination: There is a strange feeling that you must almost prove yourself worthy of feeling sad and scared like everyone else. He added: The vitriolic and hate-filled rhetoric coming from Mr. Trump isn t so far off from cursing at strangers from a car window. He has said that people in the American Muslim community  know who the bad ones are,  implying that millions of innocent people are somehow complicit in awful attacks. Not only is this wrongheaded; but it also does nothing to address the real problems posed by terrorist attacks. By Mr. Trump s logic, after the huge financial crisis of 2007-08, the best way to protect the American economy would have been to man white males. Is Ansari right in telling Trump to  go f*ck himself ?? Absolutely. Trump is personally attacking Ansari and his family and is just so absolutely wrong about the Muslim faith and community.Trump s tactic of divide and conquer, putting himself and his white pride fanatics against anyone who doesn t fit the mold of what he sees fit to live in the United States, isn t only bigoted, but just outright dangerous.Good on Ansari for speaking out and calling Trump out on his bigotry.Featured Photos by John Moore/Getty Images and Gary Gershoff/Getty Images for Peabody ",News,"June 24, 2016"

When politicians like Barack Obama and Hillary put special interests and lobbyists who are using phony climate change to collect billions in federal  green subsidies  over working Americans, you know these people are no longer  public servants  but instead, self-servants. Watch:There was a time, not so long ago, when this city on the Ohio River employed up to 15,000 people in the steel mills whose rusting warehouses still line the streets. Now the figure is closer to 800.First, it was costs associated with the repeated regulations imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency. Then, after 1994 and the passing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) it was cheaper competition from places such as Mexico. In the end, there was no way Weirton could compete, and an industry that has fed and clothed the city for generations essentially died. Her husband introduced Nafta,  said a former steel worker, sitting at the the bar of the Columbia Club, located at one was once Gate No 1 of the Weirton Steel Corporation s main factory. He had worked at the plant for 34 years.  If anyone in this in this state votes for her, they re crazy. It is communities such as this that Donald Trump has been targeting hard with his pitch about the evils of Nafta and the need to bring jobs   well-paid manufacturing jobs in particular   back to America. Polls collected by RealClearPolitics suggest he leads Hillary Clinton in West Virginia by between 18 to 27 points.While his policy is not hard on detail, Mr Trump has vowed repeatedly to bring jobs back from places such as Mexico and China.But in places such as Weirton, down to fewer than 20,000 people from a peak of 33,000 it is hard not to feel that while some parts of the country may have seen the benefits of global trade, this hardscrabble community, with its fast-food joints and strip bars, has been passed by.Ed Sutton, a city government worker who said he would be voting for Mr Trump, said that  nothing had replaced the steel jobs .

828, Donald Trump Is Clearly Panicking; Avoiding The People Who Voted For Him,"Donald Trump s presidency is spiraling out of control and Dear Leader appears to be holed up in the White House, avoiding even the people who still support him.Immediately following his return from the G20 summit in Europe this month, even his daily schedule went completely blank as he retreated behind the walls of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Trump has at least added some daily events to his schedule in recent days, but he s not venturing outside.It was Vice President Mike Pence   not Trump   who left the White House Tuesday and spoke publicly and at length about the Republicans  health care bill in the wake of its Senate collapse, not Trump. Unlike Trump, Pence has been maintaining a very public profile in recent days.Source: Share BlueIn the last month, when Trump wasn t leaving the country, pretty much the only reason he left the White House was to go play golf or to watch golf, which he did on June 24, 25, and 30, as well as July 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 14, 15, and 16. Outside of playing golf or promoting his own business properties, however, Trump is clearly in hiding.To be fair, Trump isn t completely MIA. He did a photo op in a firetruck (just like a big boy) on Monday and he s spent a lot of time on his golf course. But when it comes to using his legendary (in his own mind) negotiating skills to help save the repeal and replacement of Obamacare (one of his top campaign promises), the Deal Artist offered little to nothing.While this is pretty much unprecedented, it signals something major is happening within the White House. Since taking office, he s soothed his fragile ego by holding campaign style rallies in front of fawning fans. The last one he held, which was his last state-side public appearance, was nearly a month ago. While the fans still exist, Trump is even avoiding them. Instead, he s presumably seeking comfort in Kentucky Fried Chicken and chocolate cake in front of an increasingly incredulous Fox News.This isn t particularly surprising. Trump has a difficult time in situations that don t offer him adulation. He refuses to make a state visit to the UK until Prime Minister Theresa May can guarantee the nearly universally despised America leader a warm reception.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"July 19, 2017"

When Mullen took his grievance to the assistant principal s office, the solution offered was simply to leave the hat at home.Mullen said: I knew kids would pick on me about it, that s just kids being kids, but when the adults started doing it I thought that s problematic. This is a school that preaches equality. Oh dear. Yes, he actually said that. He just equated himself to the plight for equality because he s being teased for wearing a bigot s hat. The irony is palpable.According to Mullen, the reason he wants Trump to be president is: I want a job  where you can help people, and I ve heard Trump say how important he thinks veterans and (people in law enforcement) are. Oh, dear boy, please, oh please don t believe the pandering nonsense that comes out of Trump s mouth. And as far as his love for veterans, how much he s been supposedly giving veteran groups is highly questionable.Here s the thing, the school isn t telling him he shouldn t wear the hat, but they are suggesting if he d like to stop being relentlessly mocked for such a poor fashion decision, that he should probably just leave the hat at home. Trump is a bigot and probably the worst choice this country could ever have for the role of Commander-in-Chief.The bigger concern here is, what is this student being taught that he believes Trump is a good option? Maybe that should be the real story.Watch the story via WCSH out of Portland, Maine:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 13, 2016"
8887, ‘Pissed As Hell’ Oregon Rancher FURIOUS At Bundy Militia: ‘This Is My Home!’ (VIDEO),"Georgia Marshall has had just about enough of the white privilege performance art masquerading as a patriotic revolt against the tyranny of something something EVIL GUB MINT! Ever since the Bundy terrorists seized a wildlife refuge in Harney County, the entire county has been seriously pissed off at the presumption of these idiots that they speak for the residents. Unlike the Bundy cosplayers, the residents of Harney are grown ups who have worked very hard to build a working relationship with their government: The progress we ve made in this community compared with the sh*t we went through years ago when you could not stand in talk to a manager,  she told the crowd.  Granted, it s not a lot of progress but it s coming. Marshall pointed out that an organization called the High Desert Partnership was already working  damn hard  for the residents of Harney County. We are the poster child of the ranching community, of the environmental community, of the government community!  she exclaimed.  Have we ever had anybody put together a refuge plan in this god damn nation? Hell, no, we haven t! But it happened here and it happened in Harney County. This is how grownups behave. If you don t like how the local government works, you push and you compromise and you talk and you keep pushing until things start to get better. On the other hand, when you re an entitled, self-important little shit like Ammon Bundy, you pull out your gun, holler about  freedumb!  and demand your every whim be catered to. Especially getting snacks.Here s the awesome video of Georgia taking the Bundy morons behind the woodshed for a shellacking:Now, if it seems odd that a group of anti-government jackasses would show up in Oregon and make demands for a community they don t belong to, you re not crazy. When the Bundy boys originally rolled into town, they were all about the Hammond family not serving the full sentence for their crimes. But, the Hammonds said  Holy crap! These yahoos aren t with us! Please let us serve our time in peace  and the Bundy boneheads suddenly found themselves without a cause. So, as wealthy entitled white people, they defaulted to  Waaaaahhhh! The government is oppressing us!  and demanded they be given more free stuff because in right-wing  Murika, rich white people get everything and screw everyone else.I hope Georgia and the other residents of Harney get their wish for a Bundy-free county so they can live their lives the way they want, not the way a group of wannabe martyrs and cheap knockoff revolutionaries say they should.Featured image via screencap.",News,"January 8, 2016"
13217,FEDERAL JUDGE Goes On Rant About Cops Killing Blacks….Declares: “Black Lives Matter!”…Blames Deaths Of Cops On Cops,"This is a great story for anyone who doesn t understand the power one liberal judge can wield from the bench. U.S. District Judge Robart, who is presiding over a 2012 consent decree requiring the city to adopt reforms to address federal allegations of police bias, rebuked the Seattle police union for holding up reforms as it bargains over a new contract, The Seattle Times reported. The court and the citizens of Seattle will not be held hostage for increased payments and benefits,  the judge said, according to the paper. To hide behind a collective-bargaining agreement is not going to work,  he said.Kevin Stuckey, who recently became president of the Seattle Police Officers  Guild, said the union is prepared to sit down with the city and reach a deal.Judge Robart, a George W. Bush appointee, said proposed police reform legislation should include putting a civilian in charge of police oversight, shutting down a police-led disciplinary board and creating a civilian position of inspector general.Judge Robart threatened to call a hearing and override the city s bargaining process with the union if he concluded the union was interfering with reform, The Times reported. The judge ended Monday s hearing by citing a statistic that claimed 41 percent of the shootings nationwide by police were of blacks.  Black lives matter,  he said, drawing an audible reaction in a courtroom, The Times reported.Judge Robart added that the recent targeted shootings of police officers across the country signaled the importance of strengthening police and community relations.Commissioner Enrique Gonzalez said he s  very encouraged that a federal judge has actually said that black lives matter, because now we know that not only is this movement happening in the streets   even a federal judge has acknowledged that people of color have been on the receiving end of police brutality and this needs to change,  The Stranger reported.

15278,SAY WHAT? #BlackLivesMatter TEXTBOOKS TO BE USED AS PART OF COMMON CORE CURRICULUM IN GRADES 6-12 [Video],"When will American citizens stop being afraid to stand up and SPEAK OUT against the  politically correct  thugs of the left?A new  Black Lives Matter  textbook will soon be available to middle school and high school classrooms.According to the publisher s description,  Black Lives Matter  covers the shootings that touched off passionate protests, the work of activists to bring about a more just legal system, and the tensions in U.S. society that these events have brought to light. ABDO Publishing specifies that the book was written for sixth graders through high school students, and says the textbook is  aligned to Common Core Standards and correlated to state standards. Until now, no authoritative text designed to teach non-black children about historical-structural inequalities productive of anti-black violence in U.S. law and society has been made available for commercial consumption,  reads a review in The Feminist Wire. Parents as well as teachers eager to teach middle and/or high school students about the routine vulnerability and terror generative of the rejoined,  Black Lives Matter,  will find an invaluable resource in this special report. Conservative radio commentator Larry Elder weighed in on Fox and Friends over the weekend. [The textbook] is indoctrinating young kids, teaching them black people are victims,  Elder said.He argued that the movement would be better off addressing black-on-black crime. If the  Black Lives Matter  people are really concerned, they ought to say something about the fact that last year 6,000 blacks shot other blacks, and far and away the number one cause of preventable death for young black men is homicide,  he added. The textbook was co-authored by Missouri journalist Sue Bradford Edwards and Duchess Harris, a professor of American Studies at Macalester College in Minnesota. Harris is also the author of  Black Feminist Politics from Kennedy to Obama  and a co-editor of  Racially Writing the Republic: Racists, Race Rebels, and Transformations of American Identity. Black Lives Matter  is part of ABDO Publishing s  Special Report  series of books that aim  to help readers develop an essential understanding of current events and encourage them to form their own opinions. There are a total of eight titles in the  Special Report  series, including  Ebola Outbreak,   ISIS,  and  Transgender Rights and Issues.  Via: Red Alert Politics ",politics,"Aug 24, 2015"
3421, Foreign Governments Have Been Giving Elections To Republicans For Decades,"During the revelations that Russia had a giant hand in influencing our election, one word has been used throughout the media: unprecedented. Well, unprecedented is not exactly true. While it is true that Russia s hacking has been blatant and Trump s involvement is becoming undeniable, this isn t the first time a foreign and hostile government has played a role in installing a Republican leader and we don t have to go very far back to see examples.Nearly 50 years ago, in 1968, the most famously scandal-ridden President began his term under a scandal. After his Democratic opponent Vice President Hubert Humphrey switched course from his president, Lyndon B. Johnson, and promised that we would pull out of the Vietnam war, Nixon began falling in the polls. On October 30th, Johnson, though, announced that there would be peace talks and Nixon s lead disappeared. So, Nixon invited Vietnam to intervene.Nixon s team met secretly with Anna Chan Chennault, a wealthy supporter of Taiwanese President Chiang Kai-shek, co-chair of Republican Women for Nixon and confidante of South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu. At Nixon s behest, Chennault informed Thieu that Nixon would secure a better deal for his country than either Humphrey or Johnson, and that the Democrats were effectively prepared to sell out Saigon in order to secure peace at any price. If Chennault could convince Thieu to stay away from the negotiating table, the talks would collapse, LBJ would look foolish and the Democrats  11th-hour gambit would fail.Johnson and the Democrats knew it was happening. The National Security Agency had intercepted cables between Thieu and his D.C. ambassador.( [I am] still in contact with the Nixon entourage, which continues to be the favorite despite the uncertainty provoked by the news of an imminent bombing halt,  one communiqu  began.) On the basis of these cables, LBJ ordered the FBI to tap Chennault s phone; the bureau, in turn, concluded that she  contacted Vietnamese Ambassador Bui Diem and advised him that she had received a message from her boss (not further identified) which her boss wanted her to give personally to the ambassador. She said the message was that the ambassador is to  hold on, we are gonna win  and that her boss also said,  Hold on, he understands all of it. Johnson didn t mince words. He called it  treason,  and a gross violation of the Logan Act, which prohibits civilians from negotiating with foreign governments. Still, there wasn t enough to firmly plant the smoking gun in Nixon s hands, so the American people didn t have this bit of information before the election.South Vietnam pulled out of the peace talks and well, we got a President Nixon. The rest is history, and well, people should be reminded that an administration that begins in scandal will likely end in scandal.The second recent instance happened fewer than 40 years ago. In 1979, university students in Tehran, Iran stormed the American embassy there and took 63 American hostages. In hindsight, we were kind of asking for it. In 1953, the CIA helped overthrow Iran s government because of oil. Instead, we installed the Shah, who was corrupt and brutal. When the Shah fell in 1979, then President Jimmy Carter allowed the Shah to seek medical treatment for cancer in the United States. Iran s new leader, Ayatollah Sayyid Ruhulla Musawi Khomeini, who hated us anyway, demanded extradition so the Shah could face trial. Carter refused.Still, as we were nearing the election, it appeared that the hostage situation was coming to a resolution, which would have nearly assured Carter of reelection. The Reagan camp couldn t let that happen. Reagan s campaign manager, William Casey talked to sources close to the ayatollah and convinced them to delay the release of the hostages. Reagan went on to win the election and the hostages were released on inauguration day.Of course, details of both these cases are different from the details in the Trump/Russia hacking scandal, but I would argue that today we are in a worse situation. By helping Trump, Russia is providing themselves blackmail ammo in case Trump does something they might not find agreeable. More than that, though, in the days when cyber security is at the top of everyone s minds, what Russia has done to us is as dangerous as any terrorist act and the ramifications are far bigger. Trump has allowed a hostile foreign government to infiltrate our electronic communication, which is almost everything. What s next, credit card information and IRS records of individuals who speak out against Trump?The bottom line is that we can t allow Donald Trump to take office. There s too much at stake. We can t afford another Nixon. We can t even afford another Reagan.Featured image via Sean Gallup/Getty Images. ",News,"December 13, 2016"
367, Ohio Fireman In Deep Sh*t For HORRIBLE Remarks About Saving ‘N*****s’,"A firefighter in Ohio recently came under fire for expressing his  economic uncertainty  (a synonym the media concocted for  racism  while attempting to explain why people voted for Trump) about rescuing black people.If it came down to choosing to rescue a single dog or  a million n*ggers,  Franklin township firefighter Tyler Roysdon says he would save the dog, which is  more important than  all those African-Americans he hates.According to Roysdon s Facebook  likes,  he is a fan of Donald Trump, Duck Dynasty, and far-Right Facebook group  Uncle Sam s Misguided Children    just so you know what sort of person we re dealing with.Roysdon was suspended from his position  indefinitely  as soon as township officials learned of the post, which went viral on social media because that s what happens when terrible people say terrible things. It s also very likely he will lose his job according to a statement from officials: Recently, a Franklin Township volunteer firefighter posted unacceptable remarks on social media.  Upon gaining knowledge of this information, Fire Chief Steve Bishop immediately contacted the firefighter and directed the comments be removed.  The firefighter was suspended without pay until the Board of Township Trustees could meet to determine a course of action.  Chief Bishop does not have the authority to terminate employees.  Termination of any township employee requires a vote by the Board of Trustees. It s unclear if Roysdon s racism has ever affected his work or if he has caused anyone to die, but this is absolutely something that should be investigated.Featured image via screengrab",News,"September 16, 2017"

18197,"WATCH: KELLYANNE CONWAY Gives Dreaded Answer To Liberal Hack, “This Week” Host George Stephanopoulos’ Question About Trump’s Plans To Run In 2020","ABC host George Stephanopoulos sat down with Kellyanne Conway for an interview this morning on  This Week . Stephanopoulos started out the interview by mentioning the new jobs report and the explosion of the stock market under President Trump. He barely took a breath before he jumped directly to a poll that showed despite all of his many accomplishments, that Trump isn t very popular. Kellyanne Conway was quick to point out, that although Trump s poll numbers aren t as strong as she d like them to be, he s keeping his head down and focusing on his agenda. In other words, President Trump is laser focused on honoring the campaign promises he made to American people who elected him. What a novel idea One can only imagine the disappointment Stephanopoulos must have felt when he got the dreaded answer from Conway to his question about President Trump s plans to run in 2020. After all, who could forget when George Stephanopoulos  wife promised (but of course, didn t follow through) that she would move her family to another country if President Trump won the election?Watch:Conway responded to Stephanopoulos  question about Trump running in 2020:  The president says privately and publicly, often, George that he ll be president for seven and a half more years, so he plans on being a two-term president. Last week, the New York Times article attempted to convince their readers that the Republican Party is divided and fractured and that many of the members of the party were attempting to convince Vice President Mike Pence to run for president in 2020.Pence was furious at the accusation that he was somehow involved in a potential coup against President Trump. So much for the wishful thinking of not very credible and very biased New York Times.And finally, it wouldn t be an interview with the mainstream media if they didn t ask about Trump s phony Russia connection. Kellyanne Conway didn t disappoint with her answer as she blasted Stephanopoulos for pushing the fake narrative:  People just can t get over that election, George.

Here s a clip from an interview with Jew hater and racist Louis Farrakhan:He s a follower and admirer of this racist Jew hater. He s clearly one of the most angry black men in the  entertainment  business. After watching this interview, you will better understand the mentality of the protestors  on the streets who are getting in the faces of cops (of whom the majority are good men and women protecting and defending the citizens within their jurisdiction). It should be noted, that  Killer Mike s  dad was a police officer or  dirty pig  as he likes to call them.Killer Mike views rap as social activism, and never shies away from sharing his opinions on race and abuses of power. Whether he s condemning institutionalized corruption in  Reagan  or speaking out against police brutality with Run The Jewels   Close Your Eyes,  if Killer Mike thinks it s messed up, he s going to let you know.This Friday, April 24, MIT students will have the chance to hear how messed up race relations are, when Killer Mike delivers a lecture titled  Race Relations in the U.S.  at the school. According to the press release, he ll be talking about how current and advancing technology are shaping race relations. (We re guessing that he doesn t regard drone surveillance as a democratizing agent.) Chances are pretty good that Killer Mike will also be addressing the spate of well-publicized police shootings of young unarmed black men and their systemic social consequences.Here is an example of the most recent  music  video by Killer Mike.  ****WARNING****Violence and strong language***Killer Mike s lecture is the second in MIT s new Hip-Hop Speaker Series, which opened with Young Guru. The series is the result of a collaboration between the Arts at MIT and TapTape, an MIT-based music startup. The series  stated goal is to bring  together leaders in hip-hop with leading faculty and students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  That s a perfect opportunity for a mathematics seminar featuring Dr. Octagon and Dr. Roman Bezrukavnikov, Professor of Algebraic Geometry.While Killer Mike s lecture certainly sounds intriguing, Friday s lecture is exclusively available to MIT students and is already sold out. But if you re jonesing to hear Killer Mike drop some heated words, there s always the extremely-NSFW  Big Beast  video, featuring Bun B and T.I.We were going to include the  Big Beast  video, but after viewing this disturbing video, which includes nudity, horrific acts of violence and an attempted rape scene, we decided against it.

It s about time that an employee will testify to tell his story of total humiliation at having to train his replacement after being LAID OFF. Can you imagine? This is obviously all about bringing in cheap labor to replace American workers.One of the workers Disney fired and forced to train his foreign replacement is scheduled to testify before Congress Thursday, when he will share his story and plead with lawmakers to recognize it as part of a nationwide problem with the H-1b visa program. This situation at Disney is not an anomaly,  Leo Perrero says in prepared testimony obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.  This same abuse of the H1B program is happening nationwide. Perrero was laid off just ahead of the holidays in 2014 and then forced to train his foreign replacement on an H-1b visa, before he and hundreds of other IT workers at Disney in Florida left their job. He had been at Disney for more than 10 years and received outstanding performance reviews, and actually thought he was being called in for a pat on the back when his boss laid him off. This year Leo was instrumental,  reads one of the reviews Perrero cites in his testimony.  Leo saved the company over $10,000,  another read.  Leo continues to provide value to our team. THIS IS NOT ABOUT A LACK OF TALENT HERE IN THE U.S   IT S A VERY COMMON PRACTICE USED FOR CHEAP LABOR:Like Disney, Southern California Edison, Fossil Group, and Catalina Marketing have hired outsourcing firms that rely heavily on H-1bs and then laid off dozens or hundreds of tech workers, some of whom were expected to train their foreign replacements.

Last year, he made fun of marriage equality by  dressing gay  and  marrying a guy  in the parade.

He s a Trumper, so he probably wants children to grow up in the supremely white environment he grew up in. He s on King Donald s bandwagon regarding political correctness, and totally missing the point that people always found racism offensive and saw it everywhere.

12408,BREAKING: OFF-DUTY POLICE OFFICER Suspended For Driving By BUTT-HURT TRUMP-HATERS With Confederate Flag On Truck," The flag ruffled an otherwise-peaceful event Friday, when hundreds of locals descended upon the Open Space for the  Love Trumps Hate  rally. Marshall Collins Jr., of Traverse City, raised a fist in the air as the truck circled the event.Collins, who is black, later confronted the white man who drove the truck, parked it in a restricted zone and sipped a Bud Light while a crowd grew around the vehicle. He said the man denied the flag s history is steeped in racism and division. It means a lot to people like me,  Collins said.  It means hatred. A photograph from the incident circulated on social media following the confrontation. Police Chief Jeff O Brien on Saturday confirmed the man depicted was Officer Michael Peters, a 18-year veteran with the department. He said a sergeant will conduct an internal investigation starting Monday. That s not what the Traverse City Police Department represents,  O Brien said.  We are to provide protection for everybody. The Confederate flag is not something we consider an oath of office. We take an oath of office to the Constitution, not the Confederacy. I personally feel that flag stands for hate and hatred. Peters couldn t be reached for comment.A woman arrived with Peters. Another man   Ryan Salisbury, a former Grand Traverse County sheriff s deputy   held an anti-Hillary Clinton sign nearby. Local businessman Andy McFarlane, who confronted the trio along with Collins, said he attended the rally because he felt Trump used racist and sexist rhetoric.The Confederate flag only supports bigoted stances, he said. The reason I have such a powerful reaction is it s a symbol for the denial of those rights for a portion of the population,  McFarlane said.Collins grew up splitting his time between Northport and Florida. He said the flag-emblazoned trucks like Peters  were a frightening sight from his days in the South. Those vehicles forced Collins and his sister into bushes and under beds for fear of prowling Ku Klux Klan members.He spoke about those experiences to a crowd of rallygoers. (Peters) had the nerve to tell me that I had no experience with the flag,  Collins said.Salisbury denied he saw Peters or participated in a protest with him, although the two parked next to each other and could be seen together. He said he arrived to stand up for a fair election and because he felt it insenstive to hold such a rally on Veterans Day. I think that as a Americans we have a right to demonstrate peacefully,  he said.Salisbury said the Confederate flag is not a symbol of racism.Peters stayed for about 10 minutes before they finished their beers and drove off. Rumors circulated among protesters that Peters was a local law enforcement officer, but Collins didn t know for sure until Saturday.Collins said he didn t feel safe knowing someone who is supposed to protect his rights would fly that flag. He said O Brien s condemnation  hit the nail on the head. I hope they hold (Peters) accountable,  he said.  He needs to be held accountable. O Brien said his officers have a constitutional right to free speech, but also a code of conduct and other internal policies.

520, GOP Lawmaker Blames Obama For Staging Racist Mayhem In Charlottesville,"According to Republican lawmaker from Idaho, it is  completely plausible  that former President Barack Obama was responsible for staging the racist mayhem to took over the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia. Because, OF COURSE it s Obama s fault. Everything is always Obama s fault. I m not saying it is true, but I am suggesting that it is completely plausible, Bryan Zollinger, a state representative for Idaho Falls, wrote on social media. We know that many protesters were Soros funded and we also know that Donald Trump is not a racist. The man was in the public spotlight for 20+ years with zero allegations of racism,  Zollinger continued, clearly ignoring the reality and hanging onto alternative facts. He then blamed the media for choosing to  push this narrative. Zollinger s Facebook post linked to an article published by the American Thinker entitled Charlottesville and Its Aftermath: What if It Was a Setup, which claimed that Obama, George Soros and the mayor of Charlottesville were responsible for staging the violent chaos we saw play out in Charlottesville. The conflagration in Charlottesville is beginning to feel like a set-up, perhaps weeks or months in the planning,  the author of the article wrote.  We know that Obama and his inner circle have set up a war room in his D.C. home to plan and execute resistance to the Trump administration and his legislative agenda. The Idaho Statesman contacted Zollinger to see just what he had to say for himself and his response was just as pathetic as you d expect. In hindsight, maybe it was a mistake to post it,  he said.  I didn t mean for it to ruffle any feathers,  Zoros said before reiterating that the absurd theory was indeed a  plausible  theory.We all knew it was just a matter of time before Republicans found a way to try to blame President Obama for the stampede of hatred we saw in Virginia. But we also know that it is the GOP and their bigoted  president  that has inspired the new wave of white supremacists with Nazi ideologies we are seeing today. Conservatives are the ones who built this. But naturally, it s Obama s fault. Because its always  Obama s fault.

12540,WOW! Governor Kasich Just Revealed How He Did His Part To Make Hillary Clinton Our Next President,"Ohio Governor John Kasich, who signed a pledge to support the Republican candidate no matter who it was, is clearly not a man of his word. He has been an open crybaby critic of Trump since he found himself polling at 1% while Donald was on a meteoric rise to the top of the GOP ticket. So many of these  sour grapes  GOP contenders who have been outspoken, or have quietly skulked away, refusing to endorse Trump or half-heartedly endorsing him, have lost supporters who would likely have helped them to win their reelection bids in their respective states. America chose their nominee, and politicians like John Kasich chose to put their own petty difference ahead of the American voter by essentially checking the box for  Hillary.  If the polls aren t rigged and Trump cleans up in Ohio, someone s gonna have a little egg on their face John Kasich proudly announced today, that he has written in a vote for the liberal war-hawk, John McCain who got creamed in the general election against Barack Hussein Obama.The Ohio governor s write-in vote for the 2008 GOP nominee, confirmed by a spokesman, won t count. Ohio law requires write-in candidates to file with the secretary of state more than two months before Election Day.With the vote for McCain, Kasich, who failed in his own presidential bid this year, issued a final rebuke of Trump.The Ohio governor has long said he finds Trump s policy positions and behavior troubling. This month, he confirmed he would not vote for the controversial New York billionaire, despite having signed a pledge last year to support the Republican nominee, no matter who it was.

20703,TARGET MAKES DECISION TO ENDANGER Our Children By Allowing Men In Little Girls Bathrooms,"First it was the decision by Target to make their toy aisles  non-gender specific.  Now, in their latest decision to appease the LGBTQ-RSTUVWXYZ (Please excuse me, but I ve lost track of the rapidly expanding acronym) community, they ve stripped women and our daughters (and even our young boys) of the ability to use a gender specific bathroom. Mega-retailer Target Corp. has opened the door today, literally, to the endangerment of children in service of a fake cause. They have a newly restated policy that says you can basically go into whatever bathroom you want, for whatever reason you want, because inclusivity.From the Minneapolis Star Tribune:Target Corp. made it clear Tuesday that transgender people who visit its stores are welcome to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity.The statement by the Minneapolis-based retailer comes amid debates in many state legislatures over restricting public restroom use to the sex listed on a person s birth certificate.While many of those conversations have centered around restrooms in public schools and government buildings, Target appears to be one of the first big-box retailers to take a proactive stance in declaring its position on the matter when it comes to its own restrooms.While they may not be technically public, restrooms in stores are often the most easily accessible and widely available options outside of people s homes and workplaces.Target s position also extends to its fitting rooms. Inclusivity is a core belief at Target,  the company said in a statement on its corporate website.  It s something we celebrate. We stand for equality and equity, and strive to make our guests and team members feel accepted, respected and welcomed in our stores and workplaces every day. Like other do-good liberal idiots, Target honchos suffer from the delusion that are making some bold step toward tolerance of an oppressed minority by removing rules dividing the bathrooms by gender. But make no mistake, it is a delusion, and a perfectly silly one. It is the same liberal-minded pseudo-hippie social justice warrior philosophy casting aside barriers to entry for bathrooms that simultaneously demand written letters of consent be in the possession of any man seen standing close to a woman. The same movement that rails against  manspreading  is perfectly fine with manpeeing, it seems, in a virtually perfect display of the nutbaggery of their entire pretend, college-hobby-turned-pain-in-the-ass-for-normal-people  movement . And yes I said normal, please find a safe space and wet yourself. But use whatever safe space corresponds with your self-wetting gender identity.Via: Red State ",left-news,"Apr 21, 2016"
4191, Trump Gets His A** Handed To Him By Marlee Matlin For Calling Deaf People ‘Retarded’,"Marlee Matlin may have had no comment on Thursday when it was revealed that Donald Trump called her  retarded  because she is deaf, but she destroyed him on Friday for it. Recent media reports have circulated that Donald Trump allegedly referred to me as  retarded,  the AcademyAward-winning actress wrote on Twitter.  The term is abhorrent and should never be used. The fact that we are talking about this during a very important moment in U.S. history has upset me deeply. Trump used the term during Matlin s stint on Celebrity Apprentice back in 2011. During filming on the  boardroom  set, the Republican nominee wrote down a question on a piece of paper asking if Matlin is  retarded.  He also often mocked her voice and insulted her face to face and behind her back.Matlin continued her condemnation of Trump by pointing out that there are millions of Americans who are hearing impaired and said she plans to use her voice to vote against him in November. I am Deaf. There are millions of Deaf and hard of hearing people like me, in the United States and around the world who face discrimination and misunderstanding like this on a daily basis. It is unacceptable. So what s my response? It s not about insults or taking each other down. As a person who is Deaf, as a woman, as a mom, as a wife, as an actor, I have a voice. And I m using that voice to make myself heard and vote.

17756,WHY WAS Mandalay Bay Security Guard Caught By Border Agents Crossing Into US From Mexico Only Days After Massacre?,"Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos mysteriously left the country just days after the Las Vegas massacre, a report says.Customs and Border Patrol documents obtained by Fox News show that the 25-year-old entered the United States from Mexico at the San Ysidro border crossing in California   one week after the mass shooting.It s unclear how long Campos was out of the country. The documents only show that he re-entered the US.The young man reportedly crossed the border at the same location in January.While Campos was driving his own vehicle with Nevada plates during that trip, sources told Fox he took a rental car this time around   which was registered in California.The new information raises even more questions about Stephen Paddock s Oct. 1 massacre   such as why authorities would allow Campos to leave the country in the middle of their investigation or how the security guard managed to make it down to Mexico with a gunshot wound to his leg.But was Campos really a security guard? According to Nevada law, every security guard in the state of Nevada has to register as an armed or unarmed guard with the state s Private Investigator s Licensing Board (PILB). This entity s records are publicly searchable at: nevadapilb.glsuite.us.There s no Jesus Campos licensed with the PILB. Here s a close up look at the NV PI Licensing Board:The document above was released by pol News Infinity who has done some amazing investigative work on a number of cases.

2534, This Newspaper Is Filing A Lawsuit Against A Republican Lawmaker For Calling Them ‘Fake News’,"Donald Trump better watch out because news organizations aren t going to take being called  fake news  anymore.If the Daily Sentinel files a defamation lawsuit against a Republican Colorado state senator it could trigger an avalanche of lawsuits by news organizations across the country.On Wednesday, the Sentinel published an opinion piece demanding that GOP state Senator Ray Scott allow an open records bill to pass the committee he chairs.Public records laws are important tools for combating misinformation and getting to the truth. But the state has no obligation to provide electronic records in useful formats that easily lend themselves to analysis.Senate Bill 40 would change that. The bill requires records custodians to provide records in digital forms if kept that way and requested as such. If a government agency keeps records in an Excel spreadsheet, for example, it should deliver them via open records request in the same format   not paper copies or PDFs, which aren t searchable, sortable or easy to aggregate.But first SB40 has to get past the same Senate committee that killed a similar version last year. The State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee was supposed to consider the bill on Monday but Republican Sen. Ray Scott of Grand Junction, who chairs the committee, said it wouldn t be heard as scheduled. SB 40 deserves a fair hearing before the full Senate,  the Sentinel continued.  We call on our own Sen. Scott to announce a new committee hearing date and move this bill forward. Open records shouldn t be a partisan issue. We have a difficult time understanding why anyone would oppose easier access to government data, which belongs to the public. Well, Scott didn t like being called out so he responded by accusing the Sentinel of being  fake news. The very liberal GJ Sentinel is attempting to apply pressure for me to move a bill,  Scott wrote.  They have no facts, as usual, and tried to call me out on SB 40 know as the CORA bill. They haven t contacted me to get any information on why the bill has been delayed but choose to run a fake news story demanding I run the bill. You may have a barrel of ink but it just splashed in your face. We have our own fake news in Grand Junction.. The very liberal GJ Sentinel is attempting to apply (more: https://t.co/VYmpfgM6X9 )  Ray Scott (@SCOTTFORCOLO) February 9, 2017Once again, a Republican attacked the media by calling them  fake news  in response to a story they don t like.As we have seen on the national level, news outlets have begun directly calling out Donald Trump whenever he refers to a media outlet as  fake news. But the Daily Sentinel is going a step further, and if they succeed, Donald Trump, Kellyanne Conway, and other Republicans should be more careful about what they say. Setting aside for the moment the mischaracterizations and mistakes in Sen. Scott s tweet, (though it is true we were not able to reach him about why he canceled the hearing) the concern for me is the allegation that the Sentinel peddles  fake news,  wrote Sentinel publisher Jay Seaton.  His tweet is patently, provably false. Worse, he made his false statement knowingly for the purpose of diminishing the only real asset this newspaper has: its credibility. Seaton is letting things cool down for the moment, but is planning on filing a defamation lawsuit against Scott.This would be a huge deal since the Sentinel would be the first news outlet to sue a lawmaker for calling them  fake news. Keep in mind that Donald Trump has repeatedly called CNN, the New York Times and other mainstream media outlets  fake news  on Twitter and during press conferences. So have other members of his administration in response to stories they don t like.Imagine if all of these news outlets got together and filed a massive defamation lawsuit against Trump.It would be monumental and Trump would be in serious trouble, too, because he would have to prove his  fake news  claims in court. Meanwhile, the media has demonstrated on multiple occasions that Trump is wrong whenever he accuses them of running  fake news  stories.In short, Donald Trump should really stop calling the media  fake news.  They have a case against him and if this lawsuit by the Daily Sentinel moves forward and succeeds, more lawsuits of this nature could be forthcoming and Trump would be the top target.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News,"February 14, 2017"
134, A Reminder Of How Much The NRA Has Spent On Trump In Wake Of ANOTHER Mass Shooting,"At least 27 people, including children, were murdered at a mostly-white church in Texas this morning, and we re already hearing  thoughts, prayers, and may God be with them,  from all the people who get millions in support from the NRA. Trump himself tweeted,  May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas.  He added that law enforcement was on the scene and he was  monitoring the situation from Japan. However, it s extremely unlikely we ll hear calls from him about reviewing our incredibly lax gun laws anytime soon like he ranted about needing tighter immigration controls following the terrorist attack in New York City. And here s a possible reason why: The NRA spent tens of millions getting Trump elected.In 2016, the NRA s total support for Trump was over $30 million. The next highest spending amount was for Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina with a paltry $6.3 million.Source: Opensecrets.orgTrump is very easily bought, and he also rewards those who show him their undying loyalty. That s evidenced by every one of his cabinet picks. His promises to  drain the swamp  disappeared as soon as he was able to start rewarding his most loyal subjects.By contrast, those who haven t shown sufficient loyalty are attacked, dragged through the mud, and sometimes even fired. Trump can t fire the NRA, but even if he could, he wouldn t because they re essentially giving each other mutual blow jobs here. In fact, one of the first bills Trump signed into law was one that made it easier for people who are mentally incapable of caring for themselves get guns. He also returned their favor by appearing at their annual conference   something no president had done since Ronald Reagan. He s even said,  You came through for me, and I am going to come through for you. So can we really expect Trump to call for a review of our impossibly lax gun laws? No. Because then the NRA spend their millions on someone else.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"November 5, 2017"
6052, Medical Examiner Finally Releases Report On Death Of Music Icon Prince,"The world reeled when beloved musical icon Prince Rogers Nelson   known simply as  Prince    suddenly died at the age of 57 on April 21 of this year. Music and pop culture lovers everywhere have mourned this iconic man s death and wondered how a seemingly healthy pop star could just drop dead at such a relatively young age, but we need wait no longer, as the medical examiner s report on the reason for his death has finally been released.Apparently, Prince was prescribed fentanyl, which is a an opioid painkiller that is even stronger than morphine. It is also said to be highly addictive. Prince s official cause of death is reported as  fentanyl toxicity,  and the medical examiner s report says that the overdose was accidental. The decedent self-administered fentanyl,  the report said.The Drug Enforcement Administration was a key part of the investigation into the superstar s death, as the prescription he was taking for pain was present when he was found unresponsive in an elevator at his Minnesota compound. It had also become known that Prince was addicted to the drug, and was reportedly working on seeking help from an addiction doctor. Unfortunately, that help did not come in time to save his life.This is the story of so many stars. They have the money and the connections to get almost anything they like for the right price, and it often ends in these kinds of tragedies. The same thing was true of Michael Jackson s untimely passing as well, and he was around the same age as Prince when we lost him as well.Prince apparently left no will to dictate who will receive his multimillion dollar estate, or who will receive the royalties from his incredibly large discography collection. A court will decide where all of his money, his properties, and other belongings will go.Rest in peace, Prince. Hopefully, your death will wake Hollywood doctors up and stop them from bowing to the wills of celebrities instead of doing what is safe and right.Featured image via Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images",News,"June 2, 2016"

All it would ve taken was a little fact-checking and proof-reading to see the error in his propaganda, but maybe we can clear it up for him if he is able to see the flaw in his tweet, wants to retract the statement, but can t be bothered with the research.Al-Qaeda was founded by Osama Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzah, and other Arab volunteers in the 1980s to fight the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, however, they will forever go down in history for the 9/11 terror attacks, an event that definitely happened before the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. ISIS, on the other hand, achieved notoriety following the U.S. invasion of Iraq, but they still existed before then, founded in 1999 by Jordanian Salafi jihadist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi under the name Jam at al-Taw d wa-al-Jih d and pledging their allegiance to Al-Qaeda in 2004.See, Ron, fact-checking isn t that difficult and it helps prevent opening old wounds, or ones that are still reasonably fresh with the pain still being felt to this day, wounds such as 9/11.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"August 22, 2017"

Stein blasted Clinton s  warmongering  that  almost singlehandedly  brought us the turmoil in Libya and could lead us into a nuclear war if Clinton were elected president. Hillary brought us Libya almost singlehandedly,  Stein explained in a Thursday Fox Business interview. She continued:And she has said that she will lead the charge with a no-fly zone in Syria, and that basically amounts to a declaration of war against Russia, who is there under international law, having been invited by the sitting government. Like it or not, Russia has the sanction of international law to be there. For us to go in and declare a no-fly zone means get ready for war with Russia. Both of us have 2,000 nuclear weapons on hair trigger alert. This is the most dangerous moment  according to the former president of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, who, two weeks ago, said this is the most dangerous nuclear moment ever.Stein elaborated on this view during a Facebook Live interview with progressive Marc Lamont Hill, who has endorsed Stein over Clinton:  In this election, we are not only deciding what kind of world we will have, but whether we will have a world or not going forward,  Stein said, adding:Not only in regards to climate, not only in regards to these expanding wars where Hillary has this proven track record   of the most pro-conflict military policy as possible, and she s calling for a no-fly zone in Syria, which means we re essentially declaring war on Russia if Hillary gets elected declaring war on Russia at a time when we have 2,000 nuclear weapons between us and the Russians on hair trigger alert.

The majority of Americans want nothing to do with it. Not only have most celebrities refused to perform for Trump, but the parade has been shortened thanks to the lack of interest. Trump s inauguration is going to be a depressing day for most Americans, especially considering that the majority voted AGAINST him. However, there is one beautiful thing we should be very grateful for, and that s the fact that Trump and his supporters are going to be terribly outnumbered.Trump s big day isn t going to be ruined merely because no one wants to sing for him. Instead of being surrounded by praise, he s instead going to be greeted by an insane amount of courageous protesters, and it will be a harsh reminder that he doesn t deserve this position, and he has the lowest approval rating in modern history.The numbers are staggering. It turns out, there will NINE TIMES more busloads of protesters than supporters. As PoliticusUSA reports: Protesters have reserved six times more parking permits for buses (1,800) for the Women s March on Washington than Trump supporters have requested for the inauguration. NBC4 in Washington, D.C. stated: Councilmember Charles Allen told News4 about 200 permits were requested for the inauguration on Friday, Jan. 20. The city has received about 1,800 permits for the following day, Jan. 21, when thousands are expected to attend the Women s March on Washington in protest of President-elect Donald Trump. The Women s March on Washington has a message for Trump, his corrupt administration, and the Republicans who are threatening our human rights and freedoms: In the spirit of democracy and honoring the champions of human rights, dignity, and justice who have come before us, we join in diversity to show our presence in numbers too great to ignore. The Women s March on Washington will send a bold message to our new government on their first day in office, and to the world that women s rights are human rights. We stand together, recognizing that defending the most marginalized among us is defending all of us. This movement is going to be a big slap in Trump s face as he realizes that Americans aren t going to take his sh*tty policies and bigotry lying down.

They are literally teaching them to create their own fake badge, which is designed to give them access to voters both inside and outside the polling places where citizens cast their votes.According to the Huffington Post,Stone s group created an official-looking ID badge for its volunteers to wear, and its volunteers planned to videotape voters and conduct fake  exit polls,  efforts that election experts say risks intimidating and confusing voters. Or at least that s what the group was planning to do before The Huffington Post asked Stone about it on Tuesday. The controversial Trump ally, long known for his bare-knuckled political tactics, said that key proposals on his group s websites were there without his knowledge, and assured HuffPost that he would operate within the confines of election law.In fact, after HuffPo confronted Stone with evidence that these kinds of tactics were being pursued by the website, he acknowledged that Vote Protectors had a  bad idea  and  ordered them taken down. Campaign Legal Center deputy director Danielle Lang called the tactics a clear voter intimidation scheme. It s inherently intimidating and an invasion of privacy,  she told HuffPo in reference to the videotaping.  When that s being live streamed to the internet, it amplifies the potentially intimidating aspect of it, and violates a sense of security and privacy people have a right to enjoy at the polls. Objectively, intimidating voters is unlawful, no matter where you do it. Indeed, but that s exactly what Donald Trump has been calling upon his supporters to do because he has repeatedly claimed that the election is rigged against him.As it turns out, he s right about the election being rigged, only it s conservatives who are trying to rig it in favor of Trump.Earlier this week, a Wisconsin city clerk in Green Bay got caught trying to intentionally prevent college students from voting by arguing in an email to the Wisconsin Ethics Commission that an extra polling place should not be opened near the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay because she has merely heard that students lean Democrat. I was reading the statutes and read: No site may be designated that affords an advantage to any political party,  Republican appointed clerk Kris Teske wrote. UWGB is a polling location for students and residents on Election Day but I feel by asking for this to be the site for early voting is encouraging the students to vote more than benefiting the city as a whole. I have heard it said that students lean more toward the democrats and he is a democrat. I have spoken with our Chief of Staff and others at City Hall and they agree that budget wise this isn t going to happen. I would like to know your thoughts on this. Do I have an argument about it being more of a benefit to the democrats. So not only are Trump supporters trying to rig the election with voter intimidation tactics using hypocritical methods, they are using voter suppression tactics as well.And that is likely going to cause a lot of Election Day chaos. Voters should be prepared to stand up for their right to vote no matter what Trump s deplorables try to do to keep them from exercising it.Featured Image: Drew Angerer/Getty Images ",News,"October 27, 2016"
2707," South Park Creators GIVE UP, Say Donald Trump Is Too Stupid For Their Show To Mock (VIDEO)","The 20th season of South Park was largely centered around Donald Trump s campaign, with the show heavily mocking him at every turn. But there was a problem, according to the show s creators   it just wasn t funny compared to the actual stupid things The Donald (and his administration) does. It s tricky now because satire has become reality,  Parker recently told Australian TV show 7.30, adding that Trump is always eight steps ahead of them in terms of wacky behavior: It s really hard to make fun of and in the last season of South Park, which just ended a month-and-a-half ago, we were really trying to make fun of what was going on but we couldn t keep up and what was actually happening was much funnier than anything we could come up with. Parker says that in future seasons, the intend to  back off and let them do their comedy  while the pair do theirs because Trump is just too hard to mock.In a world where the Trump administration has threatened to invade Mexico, started an international incident with Australia, and even invented a term intended to normalize lies    alternative facts    it s easy to see their point.

Is the US government attacking DRUDGE REPORT? Biggest DDoS since site s inception. VERY suspicious routing [and timing],  the tweet to Drudge s 457,000 followers read. There were no other tweets from the account at the time.A large-scale distributed denial of service attack, or DDoS, can cause major Internet disruptions. In the past, such attacks have shut down major websites such as Twitter, Spotify, Netflix, Amazon, Tumblr, and Reddit. The attack sends a server many illegitimate requests to make it hard for real requests to get through, effectively shutting down the site.Drudge Report was down briefly around 7 p.m. EST, but working hours later.

2119, New York Times Columnist Calls Trump A ‘Monster’ For Cutting Heating Assistance In Heartless Budget,"Donald Trump apparently hopes poor people starve or freeze to death.In order to make way for a massive increase to our already bloated defense spending, Trump plans to gut just about any domestic program that benefits Americans, especially low-income Americans.While Trump s family lives in a gold-plated tower and can eat anything money can buy, he apparently is just fine with letting the rest of us live in squalor with little to eat and no heat for warmth.You see, Trump s budget includes massive cuts to Meals On Wheels, which provides millions of hungry senior citizens with healthy meals and a courtesy well-being check.But that well-being check will likely end up becoming a nightmare if Trump is able to eliminate heating assistance programs.Millions of Americans are too poor to heat their own homes, so the next time a Meals On Wheels volunteer tries to serve your grandma or grandpa a nice meal, you could end up getting a phone call informing you about how your beloved grandparents froze to death because they didn t get their heating assistance one particularly cold month next winter.Trump s budget would literally make life a living hell for poor Americans who are already struggling to take care of themselves and their families. Trump supporters are especially going to feel the sting because they are the working poor in red states who rely the most on government aid.This budget is so bad that New York Times columnist Charles Blow referred to Trump as a  damned MONSTER  for proposing it.What kind of damned MONSTER proposes a budget like this?!!! Eliminating low income heating assistance?!!! So folks freeze? #trumpbudget pic.twitter.com/dBzSFjsRpn  Charles M. Blow (@CharlesMBlow) March 16, 2017Trump s budget is absolutely heartless and goes against the values that this country holds so dear. The test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little,  Franklin D. Roosevelt once said.And Trump s budget guarantees that our progress fails miserably. But Roosevelt also warned that a hungry nation is ripe for a dictatorship, and Trump is definitely a wannabe dictator who is trying to starve the people. True individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence,  Roosevelt said.  People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made.

Congress is investigating the funneling of money to radical open borders groups: The use of these settlements to create incentives for shaping broader housing policy shows a disregard for separation of powers considerations inherent in the U.S. Constitution. Lawlessness rules the day in the Obama administration Unreal!Justice Department officials used unusual bank settlements to fund liberal activist groups without the consent of Congress, rather than help the victims of the housing crisis, according to congressional investigators. Instead of trying to help more people who were harmed by the downturn, they instead decided to line the pockets of third-party groups,  House Financial Services oversight subcommittee Chairman Sean Duffy, R-Wis., told reporters Friday morning in a call hosted by Cause of Action.The DOJ bank settlements have attracted suspicion in both chambers of Congress, where Republicans have practical concerns about where the money went, as well as constitutional problems with how the Justice Department came up with a plan to extract money from banks that it could use without having to go through a congressional appropriations process.Senate investigators are especially frustrated with how the Justice Department circumvented Congress and the law.  The DOJ used the threat of litigation   and the corresponding financial and reputational costs   to cause the banks to take actions that a court would not have ordered them to do,  according to a report issued late Thursday by Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis.

11598,JAMES O’KEEFE Gives #VeryFakeNewsCNN Advance Notice: “A Few Hundred Hours” Of “Secretly Recorded Material” From Inside The Network…#CNNLeaks,"CNN went on to trash the amazing James O Keefe saying: O Keefe, who uses undercover stings to trap his targets, has a reputation for shady tactics (Says the network who was caught red-handed giving Donna Brazile debate questions to pass along to Hillary prior to the CNN hosted debate) and exaggerated statements.Some of his so-called expos s have relied on misleading editing techniques. (How many times in the past month have we watched CNN cut the mic of a guest whose political views they disagreed with, and then called it a  technical issue ?)  And an incident in 2010 landed him in legal trouble.https://twitter.com/Pamela_Moore13/status/834548654589542401After he was arrested at Senator Mary Landrieu s office, O Keefe pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for entering federal property under false pretenses. He was sentenced to three years of probation, plus community service and a fine. Wow! Is CNN referring to the guy who single-handedly (with a little help from his good friend Hannah Giles, who posed as O Keefe s prostitute) took down ACORN, one of the most corrupt leftist organizations in America? And the same guy who exposed the truth about how Hillary s camp and Democrat operatives, who were actually responsible for inciting violence at Trump rallies? And oh yeah the same guy who got Democrat operatives to admit on tape that they ve been committing voter fraud for several years? Does CNN really believe anyone cares that James O Keefe was charged with a MISDEMEANOR!?

He has gifted Americans with his spectacular undercover work for years now, and we hope he continues to expose the Left and those associated with the anti-American left for a very long time.Armed with donations, (Here s the link to the Project Veritas donor site, if you re interested in contributing to the good work of an amazing team at Project Veritas)  hidden cameras and his YouTube account, O Keefe has repeatedly tried to embarrass big news organizations in the past.

2222, Trump Planning ‘Football Stadium Rallies’ In Red States To Push Trumpcare Through,"Amateur president Donald Trump loves Trumpcare, the GOP replacement for Obamacare even though everyone hates it. Conservative groups, liberals and hospitals are all opposed to Trumpcare. It benefits the wealthy while omitting the elderly and sick and if a health care plan doesn t help those who are not feeling well then what good is it? Well, if it helps to keep Republicans in power, then there s a chance that the sh*tty replacement plan will pass anyway. While most of Americans were sleeping, the House committee scored an initial triumph in their effort to scuttle former President Barack Obama s health care overhaul, using a pre-dawn vote, and while that took place, Congress members were literally giggling. That happened at 2:00 a.m.Meanwhile, Trump has warned Republicans that there will be an  electoral bloodbath  in 2018 if the bill isn t passed. Trump is so proud of the crappy health care plan that White House counselor Kellyanne Conway doesn t want Trump s name attached to it. They know it s that bad but eradicating former President Barack Obama s legacy is more important than the welfare of American citizens.Trump s newest move is to throw more rallies, just as one does after winning an election (wink wink). After the election, Trump went on a thank you tour, then instead of getting to work, the 70-year-old Twitter addicted ragey screamy guy held another rally in Florida.Jim Acosta, CNN s White House correspondent, tweeted,  Trump confident health care will pass House but for Senate he plans  football stadium rallies  in red states to prod vulnerable Dems.

17736,TREY GOWDY SLAMS Mueller Teams Over Leaks About Charges in Trump-Russia Investigation [Video],"Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, the leader of the House s top investigative committee, slammed special counsel Robert Mueller on Sunday for allowing the news media to learn that he and his legal team now have charges in their Russia investigation. In the only conversation I ve had with Robert Mueller, I stressed to him the importance of cutting out the leaks,  Gowdy, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, told  Fox News Sunday.   It s kind of ironic that the people charged with investigating the law and the violations of the law would violate the law. Mueller and his team have for roughly the past five months been leading a Justice Department investigation into whether anybody associated with the President Trump s 2016 White House campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election outcome. On Friday night, CNN reported that Mueller s team has filed the first charges in the case with a federal grand jury.IN THE MEAN TIME, TRUMP S LAWYER SAYS THERE S NO WORRY: Donald Trump s lawyer says President Trump is not worried about what his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort or former national security adviser Mike Flynn told special counsel Robert Mueller in his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.Ty Cobb told the New York Times Trump is confident neither Manafort nor Flynn has incriminating information about the president. The president has no concerns in terms of any impact, as to what happens to them, on his campaign or on the White House,  Cobb said.Prosecutors on Mueller s team reportedly warned Manafort to expect an indictment when they raided his Virginia home in July.CNN reported late Friday the first charges have been filed in the Russia investigation and anyone charged could be taken into custody as soon as Monday. It is not known who is being charged in the case. Trump likes and respects Mr. Manafort and appreciates the work he did for him during the three months he was with the campaign. He likes General Flynn personally, but understands that they have their own path with the special counsel,  Cobb said.  I think he would be sad for them, as a friend and a former colleague, if the process results in punishment or indictments. But to the extent that that happens, that s beyond his control.

6653," Bitter Cruz Claims He ‘Doesn’t Know’ John Boehner, Forgets Boehner Once Hired Him To Sue A Democrat","Sen. Ted Cruz is attempting to stop the bleeding after a brutal dress down by his former colleague John Boehner became headline news.Boehner, who resigned as Speaker of the House last year and thus has absolutely nothing left to lose, told a Standford University gathering that he disliked Trump but absolutely reviled Ted Cruz. How much does Boehner hate Ted?The deeply Catholic former politician accused Cruz of being  Lucifer in the flesh.  He explained that his hatred of Cruz transcends politics:  I have Democrat friends and Republican friends. I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life.  John Boehner HATES Ted Cruz.This isn t exactly surprising. Most human beings seem to come to the same conclusion at one time or another. In fact, the more you get to know Ted Cruz the more likely you are to despise him. His old college roommate famously hates him.As a freshman, I would get into senior parties because I was Ted's roommate. OUT OF PITY. He was that widely loathed. It's his superpower.  Craig Mazin (@clmazin) January 10, 2016People might think Craig is exaggerating. He's not. I met Ted freshman week and loathed him within the hour. https://t.co/2ZrbTdjHJh  Geoff (@gacohen) January 20, 2016His former law colleagues famously hate him.In interviews with nearly two dozen of Mr. Cruz s former colleagues on the court, many of the clerks working in the chambers of liberal justices, but also several from conservative chambers, depicted Mr. Cruz as  obsessed  with capital punishment. Some thought his recounting of the crimes    dime store novel  was how one described his style   seemed more appropriate for a prosecutor persuading a jury than for a law clerk addressing the country s nine foremost judges.His fellow politicians hate him. I don t know how he s going to deal with Congress,  Bob Dole recently remarked.  Nobody likes him. When it comes to the junior senator from Texas, ignorance is bliss.Cruz s response to Boehner s blistering assessment of him was as telling as it was weak. When asked about it, Cruz pretended to not know the guy. Truth of the matter is I don t know the man,  Cruz said, adding that he d be surprised if he s said more than 50 words to him.  I ve met the man two or three times. Cruz wants us to believe that he has never spoken to the guy he worked closely with to shut down the government in 2013. Yikes.But more damning still, Cruz actually knows Boehner very well. He was his lawyer.Back in the  90s, Boehner needed a young conservative lawyer to help him destroy the political career of a Democratic rival. Ted Cruz was just the guy for the job.Per The Washington Post:The year was 1998. Shania Twain and Savage Garden were all the rage. Boehner was House Republican Conference chairman. He had decided to sue Rep. Jim McDermott (D-Wash.) for allegedly violating wiretapping laws.At issue was a recorded phone conversation in 1996 involving Boehner and then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, among others. A Florida couple intercepted the call on a police scanner. The couple gave a recording of the call to McDermott, then the top Democrat on the Ethics Committee. (Gingrich was facing ethics sanctions.) McDermott shared it with the New York Times. And, well, Boehner wasn t happy.Cruz was hired, and even wound up publicly speaking in support of Boehner after   as was his plan all along   he used the publicity from the lawsuit to fundraise for his re-election campaign.It s hard to imagine that Cruz and Boehner didn t share more than a few late night gab sessions during that period. The relationship was certainly mutually beneficial. Boehner won his re-election and Cruz got to brag about taking down a Democrat and use that persona to sell his Tea Party agenda when he eventually got around to running for office.Lyin  Ted, indeed.Featured image via Win McNamee and Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 28, 2016"
14463,The “ISLAMIC RAPE OF EUROPE”…One Nation Is Fighting Back In Most Politically Incorrect Way,"As an American of Polish descent, I am proud to see Poland taking a stand against an invasion of Muslims who seek to forever change the culture and destroy the rich history European nations have enjoyed for centuries. While other European nations sit back and wring their hands over the rape, sodomy and molestation of their citizens, Poland is taking a strong stand by letting the Muslim migrants know, they are not welcome to invade their country.One of Poland s most popular weekly magazines has splashed a graphic depiction of the rape of Europe s women by migrants on its front cover. The image may be one of the most politically incorrect illustrations of the migrant crisis to date.While Poland is generally much more relaxed about expressing itself than the self censoring tendencies of western and northern Europe, the cover of the latest wSieci (The Network) conservative magazine has already prompted reaction just 24 hours after release, being beamed around the continent by social media.Featuring a personification of Europa being pawed at by dark hands   what the German media would perhaps euphemistically term  southern  or  Mediterranean    the headline decries the  Islamic Rape of Europe .Making perfectly clear the intention of the edition, the edition features articles titled  Does Europe Want to Commit Suicide?  and  The Hell of Europe . The news-stand blurb declares:  In the new issue of the weekly Network, a report about what the media and Brussels elite are hiding from the citizens of the European Union .Opening the cover article, Aleksandra Rybinska writes:  The people of old Europe after the events of New Year s Eve in Cologne painfully realised the problems arising from the massive influx of immigrants. The first signs that things were going wrong, however, were there a lot earlier. They were still ignored or were minimised in significance in the name of tolerance and political correctness .Outlining the fundamental differences between eastern Islam and western Christianity    culture, architecture, music, gastronomy, dress    the editorial explains these two worlds have been at war  over the last 14 centuries  and the world is now witnessing a colossal  clash of two civilisations in the countries of old Europe . This clash is brought by Muslims who come to Europe and  carry conflict with the Western world as part of the collective consciousness , as the journalist marks the inevitability of conflict between native Europeans and their new guests.The collapse of the West in the face of this  Islamic rape  was not inevitable though, as Rybinska quoted British historian Arnold Toynbee:  Civilisations die from suicide, not by murder .Via: Breitbart News",politics,"Feb 17, 2016"
1045, Trump Suffers HUMILIATING Reality Check After Bragging About The Number Of Bills He Has Signed,"Donald Trump stroked his own ego again and got humiliated for it.During a very creepy Cabinet meeting where each member took their turn praising Trump on national television, Trump bragged about the number of bills he has signed, claiming to have signed more legislation than any other president in history except Franklin Roosevelt. I will say that never has there been a president   with few exceptions, in the case of FDR he had a major Depression to handle   who s passed more legislation, who s done more things than what we ve done,  Trump boasted.Technically, it s sort of true. Actually, Roosevelt and Truman signed more. But the kind of legislation Trump has signed thus far is insignificant. For instance, most of the bills include creating memorials, designating buildings, appointing members to the Smithsonian board, encouraging Americans to display the flag on a certain day, and a bunch of other pithy bills that really are pathetic when you consider all the major pieces of legislation other presidents signed after they took office.But that didn t stop Trump from blowing his own horn again on Twitter Friday morning.I ve helped pass and signed 38 Legislative Bills, mostly with no Democratic support, and gotten rid of massive amounts of regulations.

This guy deserves a medal of honor for his act of super-human strength and courage An Israeli man attacked by a Palestinian Tuesday allegedly pulled his assailant s knife from his own neck and then proceeded to kill the attacker.The 40-year-old Israeli was apparently collecting money for charity at a store in the suburb of Petah Tikva at the time he was assaulted. After receiving several wounds to the neck and upper body in what police described as a  frenzied attack,  he removed the attacker s knife from his own body and, together with the store owner, used the knife on the attacker.The man is currently hospitalized in moderate condition, the store owner received no injuries. Israeli police confirmed that the incident was a terrorist attack, countering earlier reports that it may have been the result of an altercation.Nati Ostri, a paramedic who helped treat the victim, said he was found on the floor of the store before being transferred to a local hospital.

17016,DEAR MR PRESIDENT: Listen To Your Own FBI Director And Homeland Security Tell Us We CANNOT Properly Screen The Syrian “Refugees” [Video],"Our FBI Director has testified once before in regards to the inability to screen Syrian refugees. This time he repeats his concerns before the House Homeland Security Committee in a hearing yesterday. Is anyone listening or is Trey Gowdy so focused on the Hillary hearings on Capitol Hill that he s not paying attention to the effort to forever change America. We are scheduled to bring in 200,000 Muslim refugees that WE CANNOT DO BACKGROUND CHECKS ON. This is insane! The left is hell bent on flooding towns across America with these people which is NOT in the best interests of anyone. Please act to at least call your Congressman to ask questions and demand answers.FBI director James Comey said during a House Committee on Homeland Security hearing on Wednesday that the federal government does not have the ability to conduct thorough background checks on all of the 10,000 Syrian refugees that the Obama administration says will be allowed to come to the U.S. We can only query against that which we have collected,  Comey said in response to a line of questioning from Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson . And so if someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home, but there will be nothing show up because we have no record of them. The Senate hearing on Syrian refugee resettlement took place on October 1, 2015 and is the first such hearing since 9/11. Can you believe that? I watched the entire hearing on CSPAN and couldn t believe the answers given to our Senators about refugee resettlement! The most important clip from the hearing is VERY IMPORTANT!

11200,SENATOR DICK DURBIN NEEDS A CIVICS LESSON: “Susan Rice Was Doing Her Job” [Video],"DICK DURBIN:  Well Andrea, you ve just completed this interview with Susan Rice where she said that didn t happen. What she was doing was her job, trying to make certain that she understood the Russian involvement in our election, making certain that Americans who might have been tangentially part of any recording or any surveillance were protected unless they were a relevant part of the investigation. What I find interesting here is this fascination which the Republicans seem to have on leaks instead of substance. The substance is obvious, the intelligence community tells us the Russian government hacked into our election with an effort to try to change the results. We know that for a fact, and we know it from the open testimony of Jim Comey, the head of the FBI. WATCH VIDEO HERE: DICK DURBIN NEEDS A CIVICS LESSONAt her direction, the Obama White House violated the public trust. On Tuesday, in a National Review Online column, I contended that the reported involvement of former national-security adviser Susan Rice in the unmasking of Trump officials appears to be a major scandal   it suggests that the Obama White House, of which she was a high-ranking staffer, abused the power to collect intelligence on foreign targets, by using it to spy on the opposition party and its presidential candidate.It should come as no surprise that the defense Ms. Rice and Obama apologists are mounting is heavily reliant on a fact that is not in dispute: viz., that the intelligence collection at issue was legal. I anticipated that line of argument a week ago. The issue is not technical legality, it is monumental abuse of power. To analogize, if a judge imposed a 20-year jail term on a man for passing a marijuana cigarette to a second man, the sentence would be perfectly legal   a distribution of a Schedule I narcotic drug controlled substance calls for a sentence of up to 20 years  imprisonment, see 21 U.S.C.  841(b)(1)(C).Nevertheless, the sentence would also be an outrageous abuse of judicial power. A judge who did such a thing would be unfit   worthy of condemnation, if not impeachment. Abuses of power are offenses against the public trust. They often overlap with a criminal offense, but they are not the same thing as a criminal offense. For example, a politician who accepts money in exchange for political favors commits both the crime of bribery and an impeachable offense of corruption.The jurors in the bribery case need not find that the politician breached his public trust; they need only find an intentional quid pro quo   payoff in exchange for favor. By contrast, the breach of public trust is central to the impeachment case: To remove the pol from office, there would be no need to prove the legal elements of a criminal bribery charge beyond a reasonable doubt, but it would have to be demonstrated that the politician is unfit for office. If it is a petty bribe, a prosecutor might ignore it, but the public should want to throw the bum out. This is why a  high crime and misdemeanor    the constitutional standard for impeachment   need not be an indictable criminal offense. It may be a chargeable crime, but it need not be one. A famous example (though one not much remarked on during the last several years) is the second article of impeachment against President Richard M. Nixon.It alleged (my italics): Using the powers of the office of President of the United States, Richard M. Nixon, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in disregard of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has repeatedly engaged in conduct violating the constitutional rights of citizens, impairing the due and proper administration of justice and the conduct of lawful inquiries, or contravening the laws governing agencies of the executive branch and the purpose[s] of these agencies. The impeachment allegation went on to describe how Nixon had, among other things, directed the FBI, CIA, and IRS to investigate innocent Americans for reasons unrelated to national security or law enforcement.For the most part, these directives were not violations of penal statutes. But they were, individually and collectively, heinous abuses of presidential power warranting impeachment. If the new reporting is to be believed, Rice orchestrated the unmasking of communications involving the Democrats  political rivals   the Trump campaign.Her current stress on the lawfulness of the intelligence collection is a straw man. No credible commentator is claiming (based on what we currently know) that the intelligence-collection activities of the FBI, CIA, and NSA were illegal. As I explained yesterday in my aforementioned column, the surveillance and collection operations were undertaken pursuant to statute (the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) as well as to the president s constitutional authority to collect foreign intelligence (the exercise of which authority is laid out in a longstanding executive order, EO 12,333).The allegation against Rice and the Obama administration is that the unmasking of Trump-campaign and transition officials appears   cumulatively, and probably in many specific instances of it   to have run afoul of minimization instructions. These instructions are proposed by the Justice Department and ordered by the FISA court. To discuss non-compliance with minimization instructions in the context of crime is a fool s errand. Violating minimization instructions applicable to electronic surveillance is not a crime. Nothing unusual about that. Not every offense against laws, court orders, regulations, guidelines, etc., is a crime.Most law violations, in fact, are not crimes. Moreover, the standard articulated in the minimization instructions is too vague to predicate criminal liability. It requires the masking (or concealment) of the identity of any American incidentally intercepted unless the intelligence value of an intercepted communication cannot be understood without knowing the American s identity.Within reasonable parameters, that is a subjective judgment call. The criminal law is not for judgment calls. Its provisions must be precise, putting people on clear notice of exactly what is proscribed. Reasonable minds can differ on how much identifying information about an incidentally intercepted American is necessary before the intelligence value of a lawfully intercepted communication can be fully understood. That s not the stuff of crime. But the technical legality of any particular instance of unmasking is beside the point. The question is abuse of power.Here, it is critical to bear in mind something that can easily be forgotten. The sole purpose of foreign intelligence collection is to understand the actions and intentions of foreign powers and their operatives. If the government s purpose is to understand the actions and intentions of American citizens, there are two proper ways to go about that: (a) conduct a criminal investigation in which the American citizens can be targeted for court-authorized surveillance based on probable cause of a crime, or (b) conduct a FISA investigation in which the American citizens can be targeted for court-authorized surveillance based on probable cause that they are acting as agents of a foreign power. If neither of those two alternatives is chosen, then the American citizens are not supposed to be the subject of the intelligence collection effort   they are supposed to be protected. The snooping to which they are subjected is an incidental byproduct (i.e., an unintentional albeit inevitable consequence) of snooping on foreign powers. The incidental snooping deprives them of privacy protections rooted in law   the requirement that the government obtain a judicial warrant before seizing and eavesdropping on their communications.The law allows this to happen, but only if post hoc safeguards are applied. That is why, as Director James Comey testified before Congress, the FBI is  obsessive  about concealing the identities of Americans. That is why unmasking is a big deal. When an American is intercepted, the collecting agencies (FBI, CIA, and NSA) don t shrug their shoulders and say,  Well, we could provide a marginally better understanding of the meaning of this communication if we revealed the name of the American.  Their practice is more along the lines of:  We don t reveal the names unless it is absolutely necessary to understanding the communication, and even then, we prefer to use some substitute (e.g.  American Diplomat No. 1 ) rather than the actual name.  The agencies take this position not because they are good, honorable people (though most of them are).They take it because it is in the interest of successfully carrying out their national-security mission. They know that if they fail to protect the identities and privacy of Americans, and the inevitable scandal arises, an irate public will demand that Congress curtail their spying powers. On the other hand, anyone can make a mistake. A failure to unmask an American s identity when knowing it would be essential to an understanding of some crucial bit of foreign intelligence could have disastrous consequences. That is why consumers of intelligence sometimes   very rarely, but sometimes   ask the collectors to unmask. Even though the collecting officials know more about their investigations than do consumers (e.g., White House staffers on the National Security Council) of their intelligence reports, it is always possible that the consumers could notice something the collectors missed. Or they could think of an intelligence angle that didn t occur to the collectors.So with all this gray area, how do we know whether unmasking is a massive abuse of power or a perfectly appropriate exercise of discretion? We apply common sense. Was the questionable unmasking a single, isolated instance, or was it part of a pattern? Did the communications in question have real foreign intelligence value, or were they just blather in which Americans participated or were mentioned   such that it might appear that unmasking the Americans was the objective of the collection effort, not something that was  incidental ?Was there a series of unmaskings of a particular American or group of Americans? After all, it would not seem very  incidental  to collect and unmask the very same people again and again   that would look more like targeting. Were standards applied consistently: Was the same unmasking protocol applied to all Americans with equal rigor, or does it appear that some Americans   like maybe . . . Americans connected to Trump   were given less protection than others? While the unmasking was going on, was an unprecedented presidential decision made to disseminate intelligence information very widely across the  community  of 17 intelligence agencies, including to officials with no obvious need to know? And while that was going on, were administration officials (including some former ones, like Evelyn Farkas, who left the administration to join the Clinton campaign), pressuring Congress to seek as much disclosure from intelligence community as possible regarding Trump?Whether we are dealing with a major abuse-of-power scandal or not depends on the answers to those questions. Contrary to Susan Rice s latest version of events, it has little or nothing to do with whether laws were broken.   Andrew C.

18703,Proposed Budget Deal Is MUCH WORSE On U.S. Border Security Than We Originally Thought,"Only a few days after his inauguration, President Donald Trump moved aggressively to tighten the nation s immigration policies Wednesday, signing executive actions to jumpstart construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall and block federal grants from immigrant-protecting  sanctuary cities. Beginning today the United States of America gets back control of its borders,  Trump declared during a visit to the Department of Homeland Security.  We are going to save lives on both sides of the border. Trump cast his actions as fulfillment of a campaign pledge to enact hard-line immigration measures, including construction of a wall paid for by Mexico. With the families of Americans killed by people living in the U.S. illegally sitting in the audience, Trump said,  When it comes to public safety, there is no place for politics. Trump cast his actions as fulfillment of a campaign pledge to enact hard-line immigration measures, including construction of a wall paid for by Mexico. With the families of Americans killed by people living in the U.S. illegally sitting in the audience, Trump said,  When it comes to public safety, there is no place for politics.   PBSAlthough the source of funding for a border wall was never really clear, most Americans believed with a Republican majority in both the House and Senate, funding for a secure border wall, as part of our national security was a no-brainer. Conservative Review   The proposed budget deal before the House of Representatives is playing out like a bad replay of the latter Obama era: A Republican-controlled Congress   given the power of the purse by the American people   giving away the farm to Democrat demands.But the capitulation is far worse than one may realize. It s not just the lack of new funding for a southern border wall; this omnibus, which funds countless liberal priorities, prohibits existing funds from being used on any sort of border wall as well.According to a Congressional Research Service report from January, the Department of Homeland Security could have taken non-obligated funds and used them to put structures along areas of the border already spelled out in the Secure Fence Act of 2006 mandating a double-layered fence. Indeed, nothing in current law would appear to bar DHS from installing hundreds of miles of additional physical barriers,  it contends,  at least so long as this action was determined appropriate to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry or was deemed warranted to achieve  operational control  of the southern border. It s important to remember that the requirement to construct  no less than 700 miles  of border fencing (originally 850 miles) has been the law on the books for over a decade. Obama used waiver authority and very loose discretion (thanks to the weakening of the law in 2008) to skirt the requirement.Now that Trump wants to fulfill the existing mandate, Congress really has a moral obligation to honor the existing statutory authorization with sufficient appropriations. This is not some Trump boondoggle; this is a law passed with major bipartisan support in 2006.What the current proposal does is not only not fund a border wall, but it s so specifically worded as to prohibit any of the currently allocated funds from going to construction on the project. The bill actually rescinds $21 million in unobligated funds for border fencing.This means that even previous resources cannot be used on new construction as well, thereby tying the administration s hands and essentially weakening current law. Without this language, Trump could theoretically begin entering into contracts so that by the time the September funding bill is signed, he can hit the ground running with new funding (not that he will fight then, either). So, rather than take what money exists and use that to start negotiating contracts, run studies, and do whatever else is conceivable on physical border security between now and when Congress revisits this never-ending budget circus in September, nothing except for maintenance on the current, insufficient structure will be permitted.Meanwhile, the current budget retains provisions either providing funds specifically for, or predicating them upon, border security in countries such as Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Pakistan, Libya, Ethiopia, and other countries  affected by extremism. That is not to say that the security of these borders against the likes of jihadists aren t our concern, or that these provisions ought not to exist. Assisting in physically stopping the flow of terrorist arms and personnel across borders is but one basic tool to be employed in the global fight against Sharia supremacism. But the juxtaposition of these is telling.A Republican Congress is willing to pass a bill that realizes border security is necessary for countries across the ocean, but will sacrifice not only a symbol of our own sovereignty, but a physical means of protecting it (the only effective way of tackling the policy and political problems with open borders).

4574, Jan Brewer: There Were Birther Democrats ‘All Over The Country’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump and his supporters are vigorously trying to blame anyone but the billionaire conspiracy theorist Republican nominee for his birtherism. Former Arizona Governor Jan Brewer claimed on CNN this morning that there were plenty of Democrats  all over the country  that questioned President Obama s birthplace, too.Marc Morial said the birther issue  was offensive to us, it was offensive to Americans. Not so fast, you can t just sweep it under the rug. Marc Morial said that Trump  sounded like Joseph McCarthy  and added that it was a  smear campaign,  and then Brewer said it s time to move on from the subject. She actually told an African-American man that there are more important issues to talk about. Trump tried to delegitimize our country s first black president by suggesting that he s really a scary Muslim from Kenya. You can t blow that racist dog whistle any louder than that. She quoted President Obama when she said that. Obama is probably sick of discussing his birth certificate after nearly two terms in office. The President took the high road when Donald Trump took the low road on the subject.One of the CNN panelists reminded Brewer that she said years ago that the birther issue was nonsense, but  we have the Republican nominee not capable of saying it in 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2015, and then says this very thing he should have said years ago. And then he starts another lie around it,  she added.Jan Brewer baffled the panel when she went on to say that for years the birther issue,  was a feeding frenzy on both sides of the aisle.  She claimed to remember that  vividly. Jake Tapper asked Brewer,  Democrats were? Brewer said  absolutely. Watch:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3peRl_7UYA]So first Donald circulated a conspiracy theory about Obama s citizenship, then he took credit for proving that the president was not born in Kenya, and then he covered that up with another conspiracy theory saying that Hillary Clinton started his first conspiracy theory.

What he s saying is, people should come to this country legally. And I know about that process very well because my husband is going through it right now and it s extremely expensive. So there s more incentive for people to come over to this country illegally. So all he s saying is, let s make the process to come here easier and less expensive so there s more incentive to do that. When people cross the border who are not supposed to be here, let s make sure they are sent back. But what the media is doing is twisting and turning everything that he s saying and what s so frustrating as an American is that the point is not getting across. We re so worried about his fights with Megyn Kelly and Jorge Ramos now, let s talk about the real issues I don t think it s his fault. I think it s the fact that everything he says gets misconstrued.

13066,BAD NEWS FOR HILLARY: CNN Says “Millennials Are More Conservative Than You May Think”,"Make America Conservative again. There really isn t any downside It might be time to rethink the millennial voter.A new paper suggests that Americans are more politically polarized now than they ve been in the past 46 years, and millennials are guiding this trend.The young adults, who were born between 1980 and 1994, are currently more politically polarized than Generation Xers and Baby Boomers, according to the paper, which was published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin on Wednesday. Additionally, millennials are more likely to identify as conservative than either Generation Xers or Baby Boomers were at the same age, said Jean Twenge, professor of psychology at San Diego State University and lead author of the paper. High school seniors are more likely to identify as political conservatives now compared to 10 years ago. Most surprising, more identify as conservatives now compared to the 1980s, presumably the era of the young conservative, such as the character Alex P. Keaton in the 1980s show  Family Ties.  That goes against the common view of millennials as very liberal,  said Twenge, author of the book about millennials titled  Generation Me. So the current view of millennials as liberals might be due to their age   young people are more likely to be liberal. But if you compare young people now to young people in previous decades, those now are more conservative,  she said.The data showed that, as entering college students, 23% of millennials identified as leaning far right, compared to 17% of Baby Boomers and 22% of Generation Xers.Less than half   47%   of millennials identified as  middle-of-the-road,  compared to 50% of Baby Boomers and more than half   53%   of Generation Xers.Millennials have surpassed Baby Boomers both as the United States  largest living generation and as the largest generation in the American electorate.

GEORGE SOROS Group Gets Black Eye When Hannity Advertiser Comes Back After Allegedly Pulling Ads Over Seth Rich Story,"The USAA financial services firm is reinstating its advertising on Sean Hannity s Fox News Channel program after receiving heavy criticism for its initial decision from many of the military members and veterans that it serves.The San Antonio, Texas-based company said Tuesday it will also start advertising again on other programs where it had suspended ads, including  Hardball  and  The Rachel Maddow Show  on MSNBC, and Jake Tapper s  The Lead  on CNN.Following Hannity s reporting on (what the AP calls a discredited conspiracy theory) involving the death of a Democratic National Committee staff member, the liberal advocacy group Media Matters last week posted a list of his show s advertisers   and USAA was one of 10 to say it was pulling its commercials. At the time, the USAA said the company s policy was to avoid politically opinionated shows.But many of USAA s customers reacted angrily, and it didn t help when the company s advertising on other opinion shows was pointed out.USAA said it wasn t trying to favor one set of political views over another. We heard concerns from many members who watch and listen to these programs,  USAA said in a statement on Tuesday.  Our goal in advertising has always been to reach members of the military community who would benefit from USAA s well-known commitment to service. Today, the lines between news and editorial are increasingly blurred. The advertising is returning while the company reviews its policy about avoiding the opinion shows.Hannity was due to return to Fox Tuesday following a brief vacation. He had said he would no longer talk about the shooting death of Seth Rich last year following pleas from the man s family, although his network had retracted an online story about Rich because it hadn t met its reporting standards.Brent Bozell, president of the conservative Media Research Center, said he wasn t surprised by USAA s decision,  given the avalanche  of protests.

19759,Did OPRAH Just Leave “Nasty” Hillary Wishing She Wouldn’t Have Endorsed Her? [VIDEO],"Four months ago, Oprah, the woman who made her fortune off preying on women s emotions and counting on their inability to think for themselves, gave Hillary s vagina an endorsement. She gave women absolutely no credible reason to support her, but reminded them, when you walk into the voting booth the choice is clear, one candidate has a vagina and the other one does not: Regardless of your politics, it s a seminal moment for women. What this says is, there is no ceiling, that ceiling just went boom! It says anything is possible when you can be leader of the free world. What Oprah s essentially saying to women who hang on her every word is that it doesn t matter if you or your husband don t have a job. It doesn t matter if you live in a town supported by coal that Hillary promised to destroy. It doesn t matter that Hillary left our nation s top secret classified emails exposed for anyone in the world to see, simply because she believed she was above the law, or that every other person in the history of our government has been punished for less serious breaches of our national security.  Much like she tried to convince her viewers in 2008 that American needed a black President, she s now trying to convince her viewers they need to elect our first woman for President. Am I the only woman who finds Oprah s dumbing down of women to be an insult to my intelligence? Yesterday, Oprah weighed in on the election and gave an endorsement for Hillary that was an insult to the intelligence of every woman still clinging to her failed network. She essentially told them, you may not be smart enough to follow the news or to understand the seriousness of the content of the emails being leaked that prove Hillary was using her position as Secretary of State to funnel money into her Clinton Foundation. You may not even be smart enough to understand the seriousness of the recent videos released by James O Keefe of Project Veritas that show Democrats admitting to committing massive voter fraud for decades and inciting violence at Trump rallies. You may not even be smart enough to know these people featured in the undercover videos admit that Hillary and the DNC are fully aware of, and are funding their illegal activities. Yes, these same people are tied to Hillary who admit on tape they were responsible for the unprecedented violence a horrified America witnessed at Donald Trump s rally in her hometown of Chicago But let me tell you, that nasty woman you see on TV just ignore what you see, because, as Oprah states,  She s not coming over to your house! You don t have to like her,  she said.  You don t have to like her. Watch Oprah below. She apparently couldn t offer her female viewers one concrete reason to vote for Hillary, so instead she focused on reasons to overlook her negatives and vote for her anyhow. Is this really an endorsement that will help Hillary Clinton win with thinking women or will they just use her endorsement to point out to other women that Oprah couldn t even think of one good reason to vote for Hillary other than the obvious argument used for the low information voter she has a vagina.Here s a video of Hillary speaking down to a young reporter in Oprah s beloved Africa.

Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Karl Rove, and even New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger, among others.The event, the American Enterprise Institute s World Forum, is a top-secret annual meeting known for bringing top business executives and politicians together to do well, we re not exactly sure what.But this year, as The Huffington Post reported, everyone s minds were on how Trump made it this far and how to stop him.

11320,"FOUR-TIME DEPORTED ILLEGAL ALIEN Gang Member Sexually Assaults 2-Yr Old Girl In Front Of 4-Yr Old Brother…Violently Stabs Mother, Another Woman","Nassau County cops busted a Long Island man who was previously deported four times and went on a sick five-hour alcohol-fueled rampage, allegedly sexually abusing a 2-year-old girl and stabbing his girlfriend and a second woman before passing out, officials said.MS-13 gang member Tommy Vladim Alvarado-Ventura, 31, had been deported multiple times since 2006 before the shocking attacks that started late Tuesday, but kept coming back.Alvarado-Ventura began the violent spree by allegedly abusing the toddler sometime after 11:30 p.m. Tuesday in Hempstead   while a 4-year-old boy and another tenant were in the Fulton Ave. apartment.With the 2-year-old crying, Alvarado-Ventura stormed out of the home and went eight blocks to the El Mariachi Lounge.He was there drinking for two hours, when he got into an argument with a 24-year-old woman over a marijuana sale at about 2:20 a.m., officials said.The woman walked out of the bar and Alvarado-Ventura followed her in a rear parking lot, officials said. He punched and kicked her, then pulled a knife and stabbed her repeatedly. The woman suffered a collapsed lung, among other injuries.Alvarado-Ventura staggered back to his home at about 3:15 a.m. and stewed until his girlfriend came home.She spotted the 2-year-old s injuries, described by Nassau cops as severe, and confronted him.As the argument escalated, Alvarado-Ventura pulled the knife and stabbed her over and over.Alvarado-Ventura promptly passed out, which is how police found him after they arrived in response to a 911 call.Cops arrested Alvarado-Ventura and charged him with predatory sexual assault, attempted murder, assault and illegal weapons possession.

20090,COLIN POWELL SAYS HILLARY LYING About Private Email Server Conversation: “has no recollection of the dinner conversation” [VIDEO],"For anyone who s paying attention, Hillary just got caught in ANOTHER big lie Former Secretary of State Colin Powell  has no recollection of the dinner conversation  recounted by Hillary Clinton to FBI agents, as documented by journalist Joe Conason in a forthcoming book.Conason s anecdote, reported Thursday night by The New York Times, recounts a small dinner party at Clinton s Georgetown home toward the beginning of her time as secretary of state, with former secretaries Madeleine Albright, Henry Kissinger and Condoleezza Rice also in attendance. During that dinner, Conason reports, Albright asked the former secretaries to impart advice to Clinton. Powell told her to use her own email, as he had done, except for classified communications, which he had sent and received via a State Department computer,  Conason wrote in his book  Man of the World: The Further Endeavors of Bill Clinton,  of which the Times said it acquired an advance copy. Powell, according to Conason s account, told Clinton that  his use of personal email had been transformative for the department  and  thus confirmed a decision [Clinton] had made months earlier   to keep her personal account and use it for most messages. A spokeswoman for Powell s office issued a statement following the Times  story:  General Powell has no recollection of the dinner conversation. He did write former Secretary Clinton an email memo describing his use of his personal AOL email account for unclassified messages and how it vastly improved communications within the State Department. At the time there was no equivalent system within the Department. He used a secure State computer on his desk to manage classified information,  the statement continued.  The General no longer has the email he sent to former Secretary Clinton. It may exist in State or FBI files. Watch here:Powell s pushback comes amid an ongoing legal dispute between Clinton s lawyers and Judicial Watch over whether the conservative legal watchdog group can depose the former secretary of state as part of its lawsuit over State Department records.Read more: Politico",left-news,"Aug 20, 2016"
7152, History Teacher Forces Students To Watch Film Depicting Violent Crucifixion Of Jesus (VIDEO),"A history teacher who openly ranted in the classroom about how much he hates Democrats and liberals forced his students to watch a film depicting the crucifixion of Jesus.Wilbur D. Mills High School in Little Rock, Arkansas has suspended Greg Hendrix after he intentionally brought his political and religious beliefs into his classroom in an effort to indoctrinate the students under his supervision.As students walked into the class to learn about American History since 1890, they soon realized the lesson for the day had nothing to do with the last 126 years, but would instead be on a controversial event that allegedly occurred over 2000 years ago.Hendrix played Mel Gibson s The Passion of the Christ, which included scenes of Jesus being violently tortured and nailed to a cross. In protest, some students walked out rather than have religion shoved down their throats.Kristina Coffman was one of those students and she expressed discomfort over what Hendrix did. It was weird,  she told THV11.  He shouldn t have done it because there are a lot of students that have different religions. It just didn t feel right. One student even recorded Hendrix whining about Democrats and liberals and political correctness.In all, five students walked out of the classroom and some students who watched the film bullied others after doing so. Hendrix also made students take a quiz about the movie afterwards. Not only are parents angry, the ACLU isn t very happy about the situation either.Arkansas ACLU executive director Rita Sklar said the organization is considering filing an ethics complaint. It s religious proselytization. It has nothing to do with the class, which is history since 1890,  Sklar said.  Kids having the religious liberty in school means they can express their religious views. It doesn t mean the teacher can. Here s the video via THV11:Indeed, by forcing students to view the film Hendrix clearly endorsed Christianity and violated the rights of every student in his classroom as well as failing to do his job protecting students and teaching the correct subject matter. By showing this film, he also exposed the students to R-rated material that included graphic violence. Many consider the film to be anti-Semitic and scholars have criticized the film for historical and biblical inaccuracies.Clearly, this film should never have been shown to students at all, and Hendrix should have focused on history after 1890. Now he faces termination, and rightfully so.Featured image via Patheos",News,"April 1, 2016"

5348, OK Cop Shoots Family Dog During Child’s Birthday Party (VIDEO),"Noah Malone was celebrating his fifth birthday with a group of friends close to his age. His mother, Vickie Malone, had just brought the kids inside to have birthday cake and ice cream. We weren t in the house two or three minutes and there was a loud bang,  Vickie Malone told The Huffington Post. When she went to the door to see what had happened, she found the family s 3-year-old dog, Opie, lying on the ground. He was kicking and gasping for air,  Malone said during the interview. She noted that there was blood coming from his head.A Wynnewood Police officer told Malone s 21-year-old daughter,  I had to shoot your dog.  According to Malone the officer told her and her 23-year-old son, Rio Youngblood, that the dog had tried to attack him through the metal fence that surrounds the family s property.In contrast, the officer later stated that he was inside the fence when the dog charged at him from around the house. He stated that the dog latched onto his leg and that he attempted to get free by kicking it twice.That story just doesn t add up. As Fox 25 reports here, the officer used a high-powered rifle, which he had to retrieve from his police vehicle, to shoot the family pet. He shot the dog three times, firing two bullets right in front of a group of terrified children.The officer went to the Malone residence to serve a warrant on someone who doesn t live there. Malone told The Huffington Post that the officer knew who lived in the home and was aware that the family had a dog. He said he was checking to see if a guy name Shon McNiel lived here and no one here has heard of the person he was talking about,  she said during an interview with Fox 25. McNeil apparently lived in the home ten years ago. Police say it was his last known address.In a statement to Fox 25, the Wynnewood police chief acknowledged that the officer was aware that the Malone s had moved into the home. He defended the officer s visit to the home, stating  he had to start somewhere. Here s more on this story from Fox 25. Image credit: video screen capture via Fox 25",News,"July 23, 2016"
21961,MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS: Was Sandy Hook Shooter Known to FBI Prior to School Massacre?,"21st Century wire says The FBI recently released new documents regarding the bizarre and still forensically critiqued Sandy Hook elementary school shooting tragedy.  SANDY HOOK    Many questions still remain in this perplexing case.  (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)KEY POINT: It s important to remember that even though the events at Sandy Hook were said to have been carried out by a deranged lone gunman named Adam Lanza, initial reports on several CBS and ABC affiliates following the Sandy Hook mass shooting stated there was a  second shooter  who was apprehended at the scene.We should also be reminded that mainstream media reportage of the Sandy Hook tragedy took audiences down several rabbit holes of their own making, eventually implicating an unlikely suspect (left photo) with Asperger s syndrome, in an apparently motiveless crime.Not since the forensically questionable Columbine High School shooting massacre, had the corporate media been so fixated on a tragic shooting, focusing their efforts on politicizing the apparent crime, while investigators offered very little in terms of evidence in their official story.On March 28th of 2013, a few short months after the Sandy Hook shooting, an article entitled  Newtown Killer s Obsessions, in Chilling Detail  was published by the NY Times. In that article, the public learned that the Lanza s were unknown to authorities and that there were never any disturbances at the family residence that would have prepped law enforcement prior to the school shooting: Two law-enforcement officials who were initially involved in the investigation said in recent interviews that the Newtown police had never been called to the Lanza home for any disturbances, and that before the shootings the family was basically unknown to the authorities.They said they believed that Mr. Lanza had spent most of his time in the basement of the home, primarily playing a warfare video game,  Call of Duty. This aspect of the story had remained virtually unquestioned until the recent release of FBI information this week.Earlier this week, an NBC affiliate in Connecticut published an article disclosing the newly released FBI documents regarding the Sandy Hook case. Here s a short passage of that article: The documents include reports by FBI agents who interviewed people about Lanza. Large portions of many of the documents were redacted, including the names of the people who spoke to the agents.The documents also offer a window into the early days of the investigation, as agents chased false leads and gathered evidence of Lanza s isolation.A year after the massacre, state police released a final investigative document that concluded Lanza was obsessed with firearms, death and mass shootings, but that the motive may never be known. While the article continued by placing a heavy emphasis on the media crafted stage-like persona of the alleged shooter Adam Lanza, we re told for the first time of his alleged sexual perversions, as the video game/gun obsessed millennial, apparently also spent time analyzing mass shooting crimes.This murky portrait of the Sandy Hook shooter finally emerges nearly five years after the media sensationalized school shooting. But perhaps the most shocking claim has come from an unnamed Newtown resident alleging that Lanza may have already been well-known to the FBI or possibly the CIA  prior to the Sandy Hook school massacre occurring: A Newtown resident told the FBI that Nancy Lanza said Adam had once hacked into a government computer system and federal authorities   either FBI or CIA agents   showed up at their door.Nancy Lanza told the person that she had to convince the agents that her son was just very intelligent and was challenging himself to see if he could hack into a government system. She said agents told her that if Adam was that smart, he could get a job with their agency someday. QUESTION: Why is the public just now learning that Lanza may have already been known to authorities via his government computer hack   and why wouldn t various intelligence agencies continue to monitor his behavior after committing an illegal act that may have been a national security concern?The troubling Sandy Hook saga continues to have more questions than answers READ MORE DAILY SHOOTER NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Daily Shooter FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV",US_News,"October 25, 2017"
6814, Tennessee Republican Leader Vows Punishing Tax Hike On Companies That Support LGBT Rights,"It s amazing how quickly  free market values  go out the window when Republicans don t get their way.In Tennessee, House Majority Leader Gerald McCormick (R) vowed to start an economic hit list on businesses in the state that stood up for LGBT rights in the face of a recent discrimination bill similar to the one passed in North Carolina.The so-called  bathroom bill  would have forced trans students at public schools and colleges to use the gender on their birth certificate to determine which bathroom to use. It was an increasingly desperate response by conservatives to solve a non-existent problem in opposition to the expansion of gay rights across the country. Thankfully, Tennessee s Republican lawmakers got cold feet after watching states like North Carolina and Mississippi get economically devastated by their own versions of the law.However, McCormick was not happy about it. On the floor of the House he threw an epic tantrum that included floating the idea of using economic coercion in order to get businesses to drop their support for LGBT rights. His plan was to block companies who are seen as gay friendly from getting tax breaks like other businesses in the state. The ultimate goal appears to be to drive those businesses to bankruptcy or force them to comply with McCormick s narrow view of human rights. All these companies who tried to blackmail us over this thing, when they come for their corporate welfare checks next year, we need to have a list out and keep an eye on it. Note: McCormick s use of  Blackmail  here means democratic and economic expressions of protests.McCormick also accused people concerned with gay and trans rights of being unconcerned with gang violence. What do the two have to do with one another? Who knows, and certainly not McCormick. This weekend we had four people shot in Chattanooga,  McCormick said. But  our Chamber of Commerce is writing us letters about the bathroom bill. Now the reason they re not all fired up about the city of Chattanooga s handling of the gang problem is because the city of Chattanooga sends them money and funds their budget. And we don t. Guess what. We ain t gonna. The hypocrisy of creating a needless bill and then getting upset when people  waste time  opposing it is, of course, extremely rich.Like his counterparts in North Carolina, McCormick seems absolutely bewildered by the fact that the American people are not cool with his party s attempt to bully transgender people. Rather than reflect on the outrage and reassess his own beliefs, the Republican response has been to double down and accuse the opposition of being part of a vast  gay agenda  conspiracy.With his delusions intact, McCormick now wants to use his position to destroy businesses that stand with the LGBT community. It would be laughably desperate if it weren t so vile.Featured image via YouTube screengrab",News,"April 19, 2016"
11514,EXPOSED! OBAMA REGIME Gave MILLIONS US Tax Dollars To RADICAL SOROS GROUPS Used To Take Down Conservative European Nation’s Government,"The cash flows through the State Department and the famously corrupt U.S. Agency of International Development (USAID), which is charged with providing global economic, development and humanitarian assistance. USAID has allocated about $5 million to leftwing Soros groups in Macedonia since 2012, documents show, and at least $9.5 million has been earmarked by the agency to intervene in the Balkan nation s governmental affairs for 2016-2011.Here s how the clandestine operation functions, according to high-level sources in Macedonia and the U.S. that have provided Judicial Watch with records as part of an ongoing investigation. The Open Society Foundation has established and funded dozens of leftwing, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Macedonia to overthrow the conservative government. One Macedonian government official interviewed by Judicial Watch in Washington D.C. recently, calls it the  Soros infantry. The groups organize youth movements, create influential media outlets and organize violent protests to undermine the institutions and policies implemented by the government. One of the Soros  groups funded the translation and publication of Saul Alinsky s  Rules for Radicals  into Macedonian. The book is a tactical manual of subversion, provides direct advice for radical street protests and proclaims Lucifer to be the first radical.Thanks to Obama s ambassador, who has not been replaced by President Trump, Uncle Sam keeps the money flowing so the groups can continue operating and recruiting, sources in Macedonia and the U.S. confirm.With a population of about 2 million, Macedonia has one of the more conservative governments in Europe. This includes the lowest flat tax in Europe, close ties with Israel and pro-life policies. The country recently built a border fence to crackdown on an illegal immigration crisis that overwhelmed law enforcement agencies. Between 10,000 and 12,000 illegal aliens were crossing the Greek-Macedonian border daily at the peak of the European migration crisis, a Macedonian official told Judicial Watch, and the impact was devastating. This is likely of big interest to Soros, a renowned open borders advocate who pushes international governance, diminished U.S. global power and an increase in Muslim immigration.This appears to be the case in Macedonia with the help of American financing.There have been a number of violent protests in recent months that have been coordinated by Soros  Open Society Foundation through its U.S.-funded NGOs, sources tell Judicial Watch.Some U.S. members of Congress have expressed interest in the issue and have demanded answers from Ambassador Baily, USAID and the State Department. In typical fashion, the State Department has stonewalled the inquiries and USAID hasn t been much more forthcoming.  Judicial Watch ",politics,"Mar 3, 2017"
469, Hypocrite Ivanka Gets SKEWERED For Approving Dad’s Move To Kill Obama Pay Equality Rules,"Ivanka Trump just proved that she doesn t support pay equality, and the Internet damned her to hell for her hypocrisy.During his presidency, President Obama issued a set of rules designed to help end pay discrimination on the basis of gender and race.The rules would have required employers to give pay data to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Such data would have been used as evidence of pay discrimination which could then be used to shape policies to end such practices.But Donald Trump killed those rules this week and excused his action by claiming that they violate the Paperwork Reduction Act. In short, Trump used a bullshit excuse to hurt women and minorities, and gave employers the power to discriminate at will.One would think that Ivanka Trump would be pissed about this, considering that she frequently claims to be a champion for equal pay. But, no.In fact, daddy s little girl actually backed her dad s decision. Ultimately, while I believe the intention was good and agree that pay transparency is important, the proposed policy would not yield the intended results,  Ivanka said.  We look forward to continuing to work with EEOC, OMB, Congress and all relevant stakeholders on robust policies aimed at eliminating the gender wage gap. Killing evidence-gathering rules actually kills the very transparency Trump claims is  important. Once again, Ivanka Trump proves that when it comes right down to it, she is a hypocrite and is complicit.Ivanka s betrayal of women and minorities drew a sharp rebuke from Twitter users.@IvankaTrump You re a sell out.

1456, Trump Shocked As New Poll Reveals The Future Of Trumpcare; It’s Worse Than You Thought (Details),"It seems only natural that Donald Trump, the lowest rated president in modern history, should have extremely unpopular policies to match how much Americans refuse to support him.Aside from his disgustingly racist travel ban, there s another policy that Americans overwhelmingly despise   the American Health Care Act, also known as Trumpcare. While it s been widely known that Americans prefer Obamacare (the Affordable Care Act) much more than Trump s shady, disastrous alternative, the real numbers prove to be worse than originally thought. It turns out, one poll states that over 75% of Americans don t want Trump s heath care plan to get anywhere near them and their loved ones.This recent poll cited that the American public s support for Trumpcare is only 23%, which basically means that Trump is screwed if he thinks he can get this health care bill to take the place of Obamacare. Almost half (48%) of Americans stated that they were against Trumpcare, with most (43%) responding that they were  strongly  opposed to it.So while Trump likes to brag about all this  winning  he s doing, we have yet to see it reflect in the American public s opinion of him and his policies. People are passionately resisting Trumpcare, and have even taken to GOP town halls to openly protest against and condemn GOP lawmakers who are trying to help Trump take out Obamacare.Trump may not want to admit it, but he s dying in the polls. It s also been reported that only 29% of Americans felt Trump was right to fire FBI Director James Comey, and 78% of the public wanted the Russia investigation to be handed off to an independent commission.The more Trump tries, the more he fails. As time goes on, we can only expect his approval rating to continue on its downward slope as he makes more horrible decisions for the country.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"May 15, 2017"

11476,REPUBLICAN SENATOR Sends Letter to FBI Director Questioning FBI Relationship to British Spy Who Investigated Trump,"HERE S THE BACKGROUND:On January 11, 2017, the media reported on the existence of a private intelligence dossier containing unverified allegations of misconduct and ties between then President-elect Donald Trump and the Russian government. The dossier was written by a former British MI6 intelligence agent, Christopher Steele, who went into hiding after the release of the dossier.The media and the intelligence community have stressed that accusations in the dossier have not been verified. Most experts treated the dossier with skepticism and caution. Trump himself has denounced the report, calling it  fake news  and  phony.  A Russian government spokesman dismissed the dossier, saying its allegations were false.The document alleges that the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) has kompromat on Trump   damaging or embarrassing material which could be used to blackmail him, including allegations about Trump s sexual and financial activities in Russia. The dossier also states that the Russian government promoted Trump s candidacy to create divisions in Western alliances, and that during his presidential campaign there was exchange of information between Russian sources and people associated with Trump s campaign.The dossier was produced as part of opposition research during the 2016 United States presidential election. The research was initially funded by Republicans who did not want Trump to be the Republican Party nominee for president. After Trump won the primaries, a Democratic client took over the funding; and, following Trump s election, Steele continued working on the report pro bono.In a Monday letter to FBI Director James Comey, Grassley asked for records pertaining to any agreements the agency may have had with Christopher Steele. The MI6 agent wrote an explosive memo on behalf of Trump s political enemies alleging that the Russians had compromising information on the president.Comey briefed Trump on the existence of the memo in a private meeting in January.Shortly after, several news organizations published the unverified allegations, which the White House denied.In late February, The Washington Post reported that the FBI reached an agreement with Steele whereby the British spy would continue his investigation on behalf of the bureau.Read more The Hill",politics,"Mar 6, 2017"
14812,OBAMA AND VALERIE JARRETT Finalize Executive Action Gun Control Proposal,"It s almost as though we don t even have a Constitution Never let a crisis go to waste President Barack Obama s advisers are finalizing a proposal that would expand background checks on gun sales without congressional approval.White House adviser Valerie Jarrett says the president has asked his team to complete a proposal and submit it for his review  in short order.  She says the recommendations will include measures to expand background checks.Jarrett spoke Wednesday night at a vigil for the victims of the Newtown shooting, according to a summary provided by the White House.After the mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, Obama said his team was looking for ways to tighten gun laws without a vote in Congress. White House officials have said they re exploring closing the so-called  gun show loophole  that anti-gun advocates claim allows people to buy weapons at gun shows and online without a background check.The move comes following the deadly terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California, that left 14 people dead. All of the guns used in the massacre were purchased legally. Opponents of new gun control regulations have argued that the proposals being pushed by Obama would not have prevented the tragedy or recent mass shootings. Via: The Blaze",politics,"Dec 11, 2015"
19977,WOW! WHAT HAPPENED When Somebody Asked Beyonce’s Racist Sister To Sit Down At A Concert?,"Who knew, that one of the wealthiest entertainers in America and the New Black Panthers biggest cheerleader, has a sister who is also a perpetual victim of racism? When she s not beating the shit out of her brother-in-law Jay-Z in an elevator, Solange Knowles is a professional victim of racism. Beyonc s crazier less talented sister recently attended a concert, as a fan not as a performer, and wouldn t you know it, racism reared it s ugly head. Apparently someone asked her to sit down and since she is black, it was a hostile act of racial aggression.If you have nothing better to do, and haven t already witnessed the circus that ensues when a celebrity husband cheats on his celebrity wife with another woman, forcing the sister to even the score in an elevator, you can watch it here:Back to the Solange and her racist manifesto, where she goes to great lengths to explain the racism she encounters in just about every aspect of her life, like the time she got pulled over or the other time she had to show her passport crossing an international border. She describes the perpetrators of racism as,  a product of their white supremacy and are exercising it on you without caution, care, or thought. The main point of this crazy thing was what happened to her at a recent concert. It s written from a weird 2nd person perspective, but this is what I was able to figure out:Solange took her 11-year-old son to a Kraftwerk concert. They arrived late, despite Solange s claim that she is a big fan. Right off the bat an elderly black usher had to tell her son to stop vaping. Solange claims her young son was not vaping, so therefore it was racism.It gets worse. Solange was standing up and dancing when someone behind her asked her to sit down. She refused to sit and eventually someone threw a slice of lime at her. Again: racism. She turned around to confront whoever threw the lime but nobody s white privilege would let them admit to it. For the third time, she experienced racism.Granted, this is a one-sided explanation of things. It s entirely possible that Solange was being rude and obnoxious and the people behind her gave her a gentile reminder to behave herself in public. Then again, maybe none of this stuff even happened.The crazy level rises significantly when Solange tries to put her harrowing experience in perspective by saying:You constantly see the media having a hard time contextualizing black women and men as victims every day, even when it means losing their own lives.Shit, can you believe she almost died in this racist lime attack?She then says that she isn t claiming this incident was racism, even though she said it many times, and chides the media for potentially reporting it that way, followed immediately by this:This is why many black people are uncomfortable being in predominately white spacesFrom there Solange rants about all of the racism in America and ends with the odd statement that she has  many white friends.  You know, to prove she doesn t hate white people or something.Via:  Downtrend",left-news,"Sep 14, 2016"

13825,"STUNNING BETRAYAL! 43 REPUBLICANS, In Dark Of Night Vote To Approve Obama’s Transgender Bathroom Decree","Who knew a President could do so much damage in one year? Who knew he would have the support of so many Republicans we fought so hard to elect, as our last hope to stop Obama s fundamental transformation of America Many are asking what Republicans plan to do to stop Obama s executive war on culture and religious liberty in pursuit of cultural Marxism. Now we know that not only will this party do nothing to stop Obama, they will use their control of Congress to codify Obama s agenda into law.Late Wednesday night, Republicans allowed a vote on an amendment from Rep. Sean Maloney (D-NY), which codified Obama s executive order 13672 making transgenderism the law of the land. Obama s executive order, promulgated in July 2014, instructed bureaucrats to sever contracts with companies that don t follow the Obama mandated sexual identity agenda. This could include companies that don t allow men into female bathrooms in their private corporate offices. The Maloney amendment to the $37.4 billion FY 2017 Energy &Water Appropriations Bill (H.R. 5055) codified that unilateral act into law.The amendment passed 223-195 with 43 Republicans supporting it. The GOP House just supported arguably the most radical Democrat agenda item in the dead of night.Enshrining Obama s specific edict into law and then passing vanity language reaffirming the general importance of religious liberty is like doing CPR on a dead body. GOP leaders are always twisting arms to get conservative members to vote for bad bills. Somehow we are to believe they were impotent in ensuring  moderate  members (what is moderate about transgenderism?) adhere to the party s platform?The reality is that Paul Ryan has long been a supporter of ENDA (Employment Non Discrimination Act), the legislative vehicle for enshrining transgenderism into law and mandating adherence to its dogma on private businesses. That is why he s been absent in this fight. Moreover, Republicans have failed to allow a single anti-religious bigotry bill to the floor since the illegal gay marriage decision was issued by the Supreme Court, despite the ubiquitous threats against private businesses, states, and private property.Clearly, whipping against this vote was not a priority.Once the Maloney amendment passed with GOP votes, Republicans proceeded to do what they always do so well. They offered side-by-side amendments in an attempt to cover up the damage.They passed the  Pitts amendment  as a second-degree by voice vote to affirm the constitutional importance of religious liberty. Then they passed the Byrne Amendments to reaffirm that RFRA is still in place and the government cannot discriminate against religious individuals. Well, as we all know, the Constitution and RFRA (Religious Freedom Restoration Act) have been in place for the entire Obama administration, yet he is still able to get away with anti-religious bigotry edicts by claiming they don t interfere with religious beliefs.To begin with, this entire spending bill was something that should never have come to the floor. It increased spending and retained a number of green energy programs for a department that shouldn t even exist.Now that leadership has loaded this already sub-par spending bill with transgenderism, conservatives should vote against final passage on Thursday. It s bad enough that a Republican House cannot be used as a tool to go on offense against cultural Marxism and anti-religious-liberty initiatives. To pass a bill placing an exclamation mark on that agenda is unforgivable.Via: Conservative ReviewHere is the list of Republicans who voted to assist Obama in his fundamental transformation of America:Amash (MI)Brooks (IN) Coffman (CO) Costello (PA) Curbelo (FL) Davis, Rodney (IL) Denham (CA) Dent (PA) Diaz-Balara (FL) Dold (IL)Donovan (NY) Emmer (MN) Fitzpatrick (PA)Frelinghuysen (NJ) Gibson (NY) Heck (NV) Hurd (TX) Issa (CA)Jolly (FL)Katko (NY) Kinzinger (IL)Lance( NJ) LoBiondo (NJ)MacArthur (NJ)McSally (AZ) Meehan (PA) Messer (IN) Paulsen (MN) Poliquin (ME) Reed (NY) Reichert (WA) Renacci (OH) Rooney (FL) Ros-Lehtinen (FL) Shims (IL) Stefanik (NY) Upton (MI) Valadao (CA) Walden (OR) Walters, Mimi (CA)Young (IA) Young (IN) Zelda (NY)Via: Conservative Review",politics,"May 26, 2016"
8813, Bombshell Reveals Nazi Connection To the Koch Brothers,"The infamous conservative Republican financiers Charles and David Koch had a family connection to the Nazis, a new book reveals.Jane Mayer, the New Yorker journalist who was among the first mainstream writers to document the Kochs  multi-million dollar campaign to effectively take over the Republican Party and the larger conservative movement, uncovers the connection in her new book, Dark Money.The book,  Dark Money,  by Jane Mayer, traces the rise of the modern conservative movement through the activism and money of a handful of rich donors: among them Richard Mellon Scaife, an heir to the Mellon banking fortune, and Harry and Lynde Bradley, brothers who became wealthy in part from military contracts but poured millions into anti-government philanthropy.But the book is largely focused on the Koch family, stretching back to its involvement in the far-right John Birch Society and the political and business activities of their father, Fred C. Koch, who found some of his earliest business success overseas in the years leading up to World War II. One venture was a partnership with the American Nazi sympathizer William Rhodes Davis, who, according to Ms. Mayer, hired Mr. Koch to help build the third-largest oil refinery in the Third Reich, a critical industrial cog in Hitler s war machine.The Kochs, who are among two of the wealthiest individuals in America, stand atop an industrial giant   Koch Industries   that has previously been fined for being one of the worst polluters in America. The brothers use their fortune to finance a political machine that often pursues goals that would enrich the brothers by pursuing a hardline right wing agenda that favors big business and opposes government oversight and regulation.The brothers bankroll a network of groups that often hide their spending on political goals under tax laws. That is the  dark money  that Mayer s book title refers to. The Kochs run groups like Americans for Prosperity, Freedom Partners, the Center to Protect Patients Rights   and then they are also able to flow money towards groups like the NRA, Americans for Tax Reform, and the Club for Growth.What those groups all have in common is their opposition to progressive ideals and their targeting of progressive and Democratic politicians.These groups also work at the state level to prop up governors and state legislators. One particularly potent success the Kochs had was helping Wisconsin s Scott Walker in his campaign to restrict union rights in his state. And the Kochs have cells working towards similar results in all 50 states.After spending about $400 million on the 2012 election, unsuccessfully trying to dislodge President Obama, the brothers announced plans to spend at least $900 million pushing for conservatives in 2016.Featured image via Flickr",News,"January 12, 2016"

17708,VIOLENT ENVIRONMENTAL LUNATICS Cost Taxpayers MILLIONS To Protect Trump’s EPA Director After Receiving “Unprecedented” Number of Credible Death Threats,"Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt has received an unprecedented amount of death threats, requiring a 24-hour security detail, according to an editorial published in the Wall Street Journal.The paper revealed the EPA has received more than 70  credible threats against EPA staffers, with a disproportionate number menacing Administrator Scott Pruitt and his family,  since President Donald Trump took office.Credible threats from liberal opponents have resulted in the EPA s inspector general s office recommending 24/7 security detail for Pruitt, which is costing taxpayers $2 million per year. Mr. Pruitt has received more than five times as many threats as his predecessor, Gina McCarthy,  the editorial explained.  These include explicit death threats. Some have referenced Mr. Pruitt s home address. Federal law enforcement has determined that some of those threatening Mr. Pruitt are likely capable of carrying out acts of violence. Democratic lawmakers have complained that the security detail is a waste of money, claiming  there is no apparent security threat against the administrator to justify such a security detail or expenditures. EPA security has already caught suspects prowling around the Administrator s neighborhood,  the Journal reported.Liberals have justified the death threats. Last week, a San Francisco columnist argued death threats against Pruitt were justified because he is a  banally evil, milquetoast, science-denying government administrator.  The death threats  make a warped sort of sense,  wrote liberal columnist Mark Morford. Mr. Pruitt didn t invent these threats, and Cabinet members shouldn t have to fear violence as a price of public service,  the WSJ editorial board said.For entire story: WFB",left-news,"Nov 2, 2017"
7650," Twitter BLASTS Whole Foods For Yet Another Expensive, Unnecessary Product (TWEETS)","Whole Foods is a store that many people love. They love the organic food, the appearance of cleanliness and health, and the impeccable customer service. However, lately, this popular chain has found itself under fire for creating and marketing products that are excessively expensive and completely unnecessary   often at the expense of the environment due to the packaging, and at the expense of its customers  budgets.Everyone remembers the absolute shitstorm caused by the asparagus water last year that the chain sold   $6 a bottle for water with a couple of stalks of asparagus in it. Apparently, that did not teach the folks at Whole Foods a lesson, because they have now just had a similar reaction to another ridiculously expensive product   oranges that are already peeled, which are going for a whopping $6 a pound.Needless to say, the public has not taken kindly to this move, and many people have taken to Twitter to blast the chain. Here are just a few choice critical tweets:Firstly, it was pointed out how environmentally irresponsible this is:If only nature would find a way to cover these oranges so we didn't need to waste so much plastic on them. pic.twitter.com/00YECaHB4D  Nathalie Gordon (@awlilnatty) March 3, 2016 @awlilnatty Fucking hell.

(@Jemppu) March 4, 2016It was pointed out that it could be ableist to assume that everyone can peel an orange; however, that point was quickly followed by the obvious fact that such people are not who Whole Foods is targeting. In fact, due to the fact that most disabled people are not exactly well-to-do, they likely could never even afford to shop at Whole Foods, making that particular point moot:@otherbecky @awlilnatty You know, as well as i do, that that is NOT who that is marketed towards. Also, the packaging is still superfluous.  Swiftie Be (@StephanieBe) March 4, 2016All of this and more is true here. This is simply outrageous. Shame on you, Whole Foods. You market to organic food-eating, hippieish, health conscious liberals, and you expect us to put up with this, to not notice? Well, for the second time in their price-gouging attempt, Whole Foods was forced to backtrack, calling the marketing and selling of these pre-peeled oranges a  mistake. @awlilnatty Definitely our mistake. These have been pulled. We hear you, and we will leave them in their natural packaging: the peel.  Whole Foods Market (@WholeFoods) March 3, 2016You re damn right it was a mistake.

4028, Uncovered Video: Trump Makes CREEPIEST Comments Yet About His Daughter (VIDEO),"It s clear that Donald Trump thinks his daughter is beautiful. There s nothing wrong with that. All fathers are supposed to believe that, but Trump s fatherly admiration of Ivanka goes far beyond just thinking she s beautiful   he finds her sexually attractive and that s creepy as hell. The latest video to come out adds a new dimension to Trump s attraction to his own daughter.There is certainly history. Trump loves to have Ivanka sit on his lap, to the point of her appearing to give him a lap dance.Image courtesy of Snopes.The GOP presidential candidate (the best they apparently could come up with) has joked numerous times about dating, or even marrying, his daughter.Still, in none of these instances did Trump specifically mention sex. This newly uncovered video, from just three years ago, does. In an appearance on the Wendy Williams show, Trump and Ivanka were asked what they had in common. Ivanka answered as you might imagine the daughter of a rich person. She said that golf and real estate are their two main common interests. Her father, though, said something entirely different,  well, I was going to say sex, but I can t relate that to her. Oh, thank goodness he stopped himself from saying  sex,  right after he said  sex. Check out the look on her face:Here s the screen grab of the very brief (if you blink, you d miss it) but telling moment:Maybe this is just an innocent joke of some kind, but even if it is, it s very telling. Donald Trump seems to see women through just one prism, and that s whether or not he s sexually attracted to them. It s also highly likely that when Ivanka was a child, her father had almost nothing to do with her, so that could have something to do with the apparent fact that he doesn t have normal fatherly feelings toward his daughter. Instead, like all women, Trump sees her as a sex object.Featured image via video screen shot",News,"October 27, 2016"
5354, WATCH: BIll Maher Noticed Something Really Disturbing About Trump’s RNC Speech,"The internet went wild mocking Melania Trump this week. That is because of the fact that a large portion of the speech she gave at the Republican National Convention contained an entire section that was stolen from Michelle Obama s speech that she gave at the Democratic National Convention in 2008.As worthy as that speech was of mockery, Trump s speech was the one that was truly worthy of condemnation. Who better to do that than Bill Maher?During a monologe on Real Time, Maher lambasted the newly officiated GOP presidential candidate s speech.  Did you see Donald Trump s speech? If that had been any darker it would have been shot by the police,  Maher said.Maher went on to say that: He used the word  violence  a dozen times, the word  murder  a half-dozen times   and that was just the part about Ted Cruz. I tell you, that was a rough speech. Maher mocked the brutal imagery that Trump used during his speech. We are a shining city on a hill where we will make our last stand against the zombies. And ISIS and illegal immigrants are coming to kill us all. The use of appeals to fear in order to move people to justify violent actions are nothing new at the RNC. However, this year the speeches were particularly disturbing because they were more overt .with their bloodlust this year. They should serve as a reminder of just how dangerous Republicans are.

22391,STUNNER: Donald Trump is Next President of United States,"21st Century Wire says Republican candidate Donald J Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.History has been made, as he will be the first person ever to hold office despite having no previous political or military experience  Trump s victory was definitive. By breaking through the seemingly impregnable  Blue Wall  in the northern rust belt of Wisconsin and Michigan, Trump effectively ran the table on Democrat favorite Hillary Clinton in what pundits are calling one of the biggest political realignments in decades. It s time for America to bind the wounds of division,  said Trump in front on a crowd of thousands at his acceptance speech at the Hilton in downtown Manhattan.Trump s victory over Clinton is now regarded as the most stunning upset in US political history   upending the establishment s false polling and the mainstream media s collusion with the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign.  Neither the polls or the pundits saw this coming.It s reported that Hillary Clinton called Trump to concede the race before he addressed his supporters. I ve just received a call from Secretary Clinton,  said Trump.  She congratulated us, it s about us, on our victory. And I congratulated her and her family on a very, very hard-fought campaign. I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over a very long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country. And I mean that very sincerely. Earlier this week, Trump predicted his victory, likening it to the UK s surprise BREXIT vote this past summer, saying it would be  Brexit Plus Plus. After being written off by the media and the party establishment in the GOP primaries, and then again in the general election, Trump still managed to capture the imagination of one of the biggest insurgent voting blocks in electoral history. Before the results came in, yesterday 21WIRE editor Patrick Henningsen commented on the key to Trump s success, explaining: Granted, half of the American population have been conditioned to hate Trump for various reasons. But many of them are missing the key point in the Trump story, just like they did in the Sanders story. Trump offered millions of voters something profound: the idea that even in today s insulated political fortress that is Washington DC, anything is still possible in American politics   where an outsider can come in and shake up a stale and corrupt ruling class.

9512,Former DNC Chair ‘Felt Like A Slave’… Wanted to Replace Hillary With One Of Two Options After Fainting Spell Gave Campaign ‘Odor of Failure’,"Donna Brazile lets it rip on the Hillary Clinton campaign in her new book about the 2016 election. She s definitely not holding back in her scathing review of the Clinton operation during 2016. She says she felt like a slave and felt disrespected by the Clinton campaign members. What s the most interesting is that she had two people in mind when she was discussing replacing Hillary after the fainting spell on 9/11. She says she just couldn t do it because she didn t want to let women down LOL! Sure!SECRET DELIBERATIONS Donna Brazile held secret deliberations to discuss using her power as interim chair of the Democratic National Committee to replace Hillary Clinton as the party s nominee after the former first lady suffered a fainting spell on the campaign trail last September, she writes in her bombshell memoir.The Washington Post reports that Brazile reveals in her memoir that she considered replacing Clinton with then-Vice President Joe Biden or New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker because of the former secretary of state s  anemic  campaign.JOE BIDEN THE GROPERClinton s effort, which carried with it an  odor of failure,  was struggling to appeal to white working-class voters, writes Brazile in the book,  Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump in the White House. The Post obtained an advance copy of the 288-page memoir, which will be released on Tuesday.REMEMBER THIS?Brazile, a longtime Democratic consultant who managed Al Gore s 2000 White House bid, says that she first became concerned about Clinton s health on Sept. 9, following an event in Manhattan.Brazile said that Clinton appeared  wobbly on her feet  with a  rattled cough,  according to The Post.As acting chairwoman of the DNC, Brazile had the power to replace the party s nominee if they became disabled. Brazile reminded the Clinton campaign of that authority, which was included in the DNC charter.Clinton s fainting spell triggered talk inside Democratic circles that Brazile could exercise that authority. She said that Biden s chief of staff contacted her a day after Clinton passed out. Gee, I wonder what he wanted to talk to me about?  she said to herself, she recalls in her book.Brazile writes that she heavily considered appointing Biden but could not pull the trigger to replace the first female nominee for president. Again and again I thought about Joe Biden,  Brazile writes, according to The Post. No matter my doubts and my fears about the election and Hillary as a candidate, I could not make good on that threat to replace her. I thought of Hillary, and all the women in the country who were so proud of and excited about her. I could not do this to them. I FELT LIKE A SLAVE As one of her party s most prominent black strategists, Brazile also recounts fiery disagreements with Clinton s staffers   including a conference call in which she told three senior campaign officials, Charlie Baker, Marlon Marshall and Dennis Cheng, that she was being treated like a slave. I m not Patsey the slave,  Brazile recalls telling them, a reference to the character played by Lupita Nyong o in the film,  12 Years a Slave.

16975,“GOOD-BYE SWEDEN”: How Muslim Violence…Porous Borders And Horrible Health Care Drove Swedish Blogger To U.S.A.,"This blogger s piece is a glimpse into the future of America. Unless we all find a way to stand together and stop Barack Obama and the Democrat party s fundamental transformation from happening we ll be looking for another country who cares more about its citizens than its immigrant population This is the last post on this blog. I am leaving Sweden for good shortly, and will no longer be following its descent from what was once the third most prosperous country in the world. Frankly, it s just too damn depressing.I was born and raised in Sweden, which leaves a cultural mark even though I moved to USA in the 1990s and have spent the better part of my adult life as an American. Coming back for a few years has been a shocking experience.When I was a child, Sweden was a dull yet very safe place to live. Yes, there was a heavy blanket of socialism and collectivist values covering everything, but there was a core of pragmatism beneath the redness. The intention and goal was always to benefit the citizens, even though they went about things in a backwards manner.Prime minister L fven Today, it s as if the inmates are running the asylum. The politicians are participating in a chicken race of  goodness  where everybody tries to one-up each other in caring for the citizens of OTHER countries while Swedish retirees, school children, handicapped and other vulnerable categories of people are thorougly ignored. Violence is exploding. Jihadist Trojan horses are flowing through the porous border along with the tens of thousands ID-less refugees.But what makes me the most pessimistic about Sweden s future is how the social fabric itself has been undermined.Now, to be clear, it is my opinion that modest immigration is healthy for society and beneficial for trade, cultural development and so forth. Protectionism as a concept is counter-productive, while free trade and the ability for skilled labor to go where they re in demand is beneficial for everyone.Having said that, what Sweden is doing is something completely different. The once homogenous population has been forever altered by a rapid and massive addition of people from vastly different cultures and value-systems. 26,8% of the population is now foreign-born or with at least one foreign-born parent, and the national census bureau estimates that some 150 000 per year will arrive to the country of just 9,8 million residents.There simply is no possible way to absorb and assimilate such volumes of people, period. Then you are merely creating ethnic enclaves, which due to incompatible language, culture and job skills become ghettos, which in turns brews crime, misery and extremism. Once the inflow has exceeded the capacity for absorbtion, further immigration only makes the problem worse.It s like someone having read that a cup of green tea per day is healthy, so they make it a policy to chug four gallons per day, every day. It s a good thing overdone to the extreme until it becomes toxic.Then you have the Swedish school system. There really is no nice way to put it; it s a complete disaster. The minister of education is a man-boy who spends his time making Youtube-videos showing heart-signs with his hands to boost school results, while university-level students can t read and comprehend the course literature.Education minister Gustav FridolinSince there is a delay in the changes in the school system, it is only in recent years the full impact of the knowledge-averse  progressive  school system is starting to be felt. Hard facts are largely irrelevant; the important thing is to sit in a group and discuss things until a consensus is reached. But with no hard facts to base the conclusions on, it becomes an exercise in futility because it s all random assumptions and opinions. As a university-level history student (!) was quoted as saying in newspaper Svenska Dagbladet the other day:  Why would all these dates matter? Who cares in what order things happened? That s not exactly fertile soil for creating the researchers and engineers of the future.Financially, Sweden is an oddity in that it never had its real estate correction when Lehman Bros went belly-up and the housing market everywhere in the West crashed. Sweden just kept steaming ahead, which means housing is ridiculously overinflated. In Stockholm, the real estate prices increased 19% and in Gothenburg 24% in the last 12 months alone   from an already sky-high level.Tear-down abandoned house from 1932 with small, unremarkable lot in the outskirts of Stockholm. Current bid: 7,5 million SEK, or close to $900,000.As a result, personal debt of the Swedish population is at an all-time high. To keep all this afloat the normal mortgage interest rates are at 2% with central bank Riksbanken at -0,25%, and yet a significant portion of the borrowers are hanging by a thread. If and when foreign banks and investors decide it s time to turn their backs on Sweden (as happened in the early 1990s) there s going to be a lot of pain.Then you have the financial obligations going forward. Like much of the western world, there is a demographic change where fewer tax-paying adults are to support a glut of retirees. What makes it especially dire for Sweden is that in addition to the old Swedes, there s also a ton of elderly immigrants that are granted  family visas  based on younger relatives having been granted asylum. They ve never paid a dime in taxes, yet enter the system with full benefits from day one. In theory, this would be made up for by the younger relatives working and paying taxes. Sadly, this is not the case; while ethnical Swedes have a 82% employment rate, immigrants only have 57% with non-Europeans coming in at just 51%.If Sweden was a person, it d be like the guy with three mortgages, seven maxed-out credit cards and four collection agencies chasing him that just signed a lease for a brand new BMW X6. Simply put, there s a lot of red ink in the future; it just hasn t been fully realized yet.Finally, there s the sorry state of the Swedish defense. After decades of constant slashing of the defense budget, the extent of Swedish ambition is to stall an invader for a week in a limited area. This with war raging in Europe, Russian missiles pointed at Sweden in Kaliningrad, and Russian submarines and bomber jets openly thumbing their nose at Sweden as they intrude on Swedish territory on a regular basis. The power vacuum in Scandinavia is so tangible you can almost hear a sucking sound as you fly over it. This, too, will require massive investments when the penny finally drops amongst Swedish politicians.So while I can t claim to be any kind of authority on macroeconomics or social predictive models, I see red lights across the board.In some ways, I d compare the country to a farm. Previously, Sweden acted like a sensible farmer and planted wheat here, carrots there, potatoes over there et cetera, by implementing free schooling, sound infrastructure investments, state-financed research and so forth. A few decades later, they reaped the rewards and climbed the prosperity ladder.In the late 1960s, this pragmatic line was abandoned as leftist idealist Olof Palme took over. But there was plenty to harvest from previous years, so Sweden continued to be the land of milk and honey for a good long while. Then things started drying up, and the process has been one of gradual erosion and decline since the 1990s.The famous Swedish health care system is a good example. 120 000 hospital beds in the late 1960s became 20 000 today. Cancer patients are put on waiting lists for months. Entire emergency wards shut down for summer. The crumbling Swedish railroad system is another symptom I examined in-depth last year. The aforementioned defense that now consist of about three fat generals and a rusty rifle (bullets withheld for budgetary reasons).A sensible farmer would see the problems for what they are and hurry to plant new seeds, so as to return to bountiful harvests of wheat, carrots, potatoes etc. Instead, the Swedish politicians goes by dogma and plants what they think SHOULD grow. So they plant M & Ms, hot dogs and pretzels. The results won t be fully evident for a few years yet, but as the last reserves of the old harvests are depleted, things will get  Interesting.From what I can see, there simply is no plausible scenario where these social tensions and future financial committments will not lead to a downward spiral of hardship and strife. I hope I m wrong. I really do, because I have friends and family I care about that will remain here to see it all play out.But I won t. I ll be back in the US being mad at Obama for being a lying scumbag. And if Trump manages to get elected in 2016? Whoo boy. A racist ignoramus who takes pride in the worst qualities of a cranky eight-year old should make George  Dumbo  Bush seem like Abe Lincoln by comparison. So every country has its problems. USA has its corrupt yokel in office, just as Sweden has Stefan L fven. Via: The Sweden Report ",Government News,"Nov 11, 2015"
6290, Jimmy Kimmel Is Pretty Sure He Knows Exactly Why Donald Trump Hasn’t Released His Taxes (VIDEO),"Many of us are still wondering where the hell Donald Trump s tax returns are. He keeps telling us that he can t release them because he s in the middle of an audit, but the IRS has already said that s not preventing him from releasing previous returns.Well, Jimmy Kimmel has a theory as to why Trump hasn t released his taxes   he s a lying liar.You see, Trump loves to go on and on and on and on and on about how much money he has, and how rich he is, and how yuuuuge his bank account is, but here s the thing, how the hell are we to know?Taking a beautifully sarcastic jab at Trump and his bragging was Jimmy Kimmel on his late night television show. He shows clip after clip of the reality television star repeatedly telling people how wealthy he is, including how he took a  small loan  of one million dollars from his father. Kimmel then says: What if the reason he won t release his tax returns is because he actually doesn t have any money. He s been goofing on us the whole time. Like he s Joe Millionaire and we re the stupid contestants. Wouldn t that be rich? Very valid theory. I guess we ll just have to wait and see since Trump is too scared to actually reveal whats going on with his finances.Watch the clip here:He doesn t like to talk about it, but @RealDonaldTrump has a lot of moneyhttps://t.co/3Nnu3XeUID  Jimmy Kimmel (@jimmykimmel) May 19, 2016Featured image via video screen captures",News,"May 19, 2016"
7792, Meet The INCREDIBLY Racist GOP Senator That Just Endorsed Trump (VIDEO),"After failing to denounce or renounce an endorsement from the Ku Klux Klan, Donald Trump topped off his Sunday with the announcement of an endorsement from Senator Jeff Sessions (R-Alabama).Sessions said he would be backing Trump thanks to his harsh anti-immigration policies. You have asked for 30 years, and politicians have promised for 30 years, to fix illegal immigration,  said Mr. Sessions at the rally, held at an outdoor stadium filled with thousands of Trump supporters.  We have an opportunity Tuesday it may be the last opportunity we have for the people s voice to be heard.  He concluded,  I am pleased to endorse Donald Trump for the presidency of the United States. But Senator Sessions has a history of alleged racial insensitivity that fits right in with Trump s white supremacist campaign.In 1986 Sessions was nominated for a federal judgeship, but the nomination failed after allegations of racial insensitivy surfaced. J. Gerald Hebert, a lawyer from the Department of Justice who had worked with Sessions, testified to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee that Sessions had referred to the NAACP and the ACLU as  un-American  and  Communist-inspired  because they had  forced civil rights down the throats of people. Hebert also testified that Sessions had complained that a white lawyer was a  disgrace to his race  because he had litigated voting rights cases.Sessions himself admitted that he described the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as a  piece of intrusive legislation. Another assistant U.S. Attorney testified that Sessions told him he  used to think  the KKK was  okay  until he found out some of them were  pot smokers. The same attorney said Sessions called him  boy  and told him,  be careful what you say to white folks. Sessions  racial problems resurfaced during the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Sessions whined that the judge had referred to herself as a  wise Latina,  then complained that she did not vote like other Puerto Ricans.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 28, 2016"
14909,SAY WHAT? Obama Gives Go Ahead For New UN “Regional Hub” In Washington DC…What They Plan To Use Center For Is Disturbing,"If seven years ago, someone told Americans that the UN would be allowed to place a  Regional Hub  in our nations Capitol, they would have been dismissed as a  tin foil  conspiracy theorist. But then, who would ve imagined that it was possible we d have an anti-American community organizer as the President of our United States of America?EXCLUSIVE: The chief United Nations human rights agency, with the Obama administration s apparent blessing, is creating a new  regional hub  for itself in Washington, to use as a center for organizing against the death penalty, among other things, and for affecting the legal frameworks, policies, and strategies of American counterterrorism.In a management plan covering its activities through 2017, the agency, known as the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, or OHCHR, puts the U.S. in the same category for that counterterrorism  alignment  effort as countries like Iraq and Uganda.The fast-tracked human rights  hub  also has a number of more nebulous  thematic  objectives for the U.S., which include, according to an OHCHR information document,  the establishment of national participatory bodies for reporting and implementing recommendations of human rights mechanisms  and the aim of  widening the democratic space  with the aid of undefined  National Human Rights Institutions. It may also involve, as OHCHR notes in its management plan,  increasing advocacy for ratification of human rights treaties and withdrawal of treaty reservations    meaning exceptional carve-outs that nations   including those like the U.S., with a federal division of power   can make to limit their acceptance of international agreements.In the case of the death penalty, for example, U.S. refusal to join in a U.N- sponsored global moratorium is based on the fact that such criminal justice measures also are the responsibilities of individual states.Nonetheless, as OHCHR s management plan notes,  in addition to global efforts to abolish the death penalty by 2017, OHCHR expects to have contributed to a moratorium on the application of the death penalty or pending a moratorium, increased compliance with relevant international human rights obligations in countries such as Iraq, Kenya, Liberia, Libya, Palestine, Papua New Guinea, Somalia, South Sudan, the United States of America and other countries in Asia and the Americas. The OHCHR puts the U.S. in the same category for its counterterrorism  alignment  effort as countries like Iraq and Uganda.All of those themes, along with OHCHR s view of itself as  the principal advocate for human rights within the U.N. system,  seem likely to bring the U.S. into closer proximity to the U.N. s tangled, proliferating and often sweepingly contradictory notions of international human rights law   and also, perhaps, to the notoriously dictatorship-riddled, 47-member U.N. Human Rights Council.Among other things, the Council, which has been far more enthusiastic about condemning alleged human rights transgressions in Israel than in any other nation, creates mandates for OHCHR, which also serves as the Council s bureaucratic support.The Obama administration reversed the policies of George W. Bush to join the Council in 2009, and served consecutive three-year terms that ended last month, claiming victories during that time in focusing the Council on gay rights and criticism of human rights practices in North Korea and Iran.While no longer on the Council, the administration now seems comfortable with bringing the U.N. s human rights approach into closer contact with U.S. legislators, lobbyists, human rights activists and, perhaps most importantly, financial appropriators, before it leaves office at the end of next year.Indeed, the OHCHR  hub    which will cover not just the U.S. but  North America and the English-speaking Caribbean    already has a warm advance welcome from the administration that also seems aimed at letting the new U.N. outpost arrive smoothly under Washington s political radar.Last month U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, Pamela Hamamoto, wrote to tell the aggressively expanding human rights body that it didn t need any additional legal agreement to establish the Washington hub, complete with full legal privileges and immunities, since it already is covered by legal agreements for the U.N. headquarters in New York, where OHCHR maintains a strong presence.If OHCHR felt otherwise, Hamamoto said on behalf of the administration,  we would be happy to discuss alternative ways in which we might accommodate OHCHR s specific requests. On the surface, the hub is part of a sweeping  Change Initiative  being promoted by the U.N. High Commissioner, Zeid Ra ad Al Hussein, which aims at decentralizing the Geneva-based organization, extending its outreach and human rights monitoring capability, and ostensibly improving its efficiency through, among other things, concentration on eight global hubs as focuses of activity.As it happens, the initiative is not that much of a change: six of the hubs already exist, including one in Panama City for Latin America. The only new ones are intended for Washington and Istanbul.According to Zeid, the initiative would mostly involve the reshuffling of existing personnel   shipping them away from Geneva headquarters, where more than half of the agency s roughly 1,100 staff is located. Zeid says that exercise, including the establishment of the new Washington venue, would be  revenue neutral. That assumption, however, was received skeptically by the U.N. s chief financial oversight committee, which called the calculation  preliminary,  and recommended against approving the restructuring until Zeid came back with a  clear and detailed proposal  with a lot more detail.Recommendations of the committee are usually adopted uncritically by the U.N. General Assembly s Fifth Committee, which approves financial measures.But Zeid has been lobbying the Fifth Committee energetically to break that tradition in his case   in part because, as OHCHR s fact sheet observes, the 2016-2017 budget that the advisory committee was assessing  will cover the majority of the remainder of the High Commissioner s [four-year] term of appointment.  (Zeid was appointed in 2014.)The issue came up in so-called  informal    meaning closed   discussions of the Fifth Committee earlier this week. Questions from Fox News to Zeid s spokesman about the discussions went unanswered.Questions to the State Department from Fox News about the issue were referred to the U.S. Mission to the U.N., headed by Ambassador Samantha Power.Questions from Fox News to the Mission about the discussion, and the overall U.S. government view of the hub, were not answered.Beyond the fact that his career clock is ticking, another reason for Zeid s gung-ho approach to the hub could be the possibility that no future U.S. President will be as enthusiastically multilateral as Barack Obama, giving a now-or-never urgency to the chance to bring the U.S. further under the U.N. human rights umbrella.And yet another reason might be that the reorganization could coincidentally help to bring down the curtain on a sensitive political problem for Zeid.As part of the Change Initiative, he has announced that one of OHCHR s important units, the Field Operations and Technical Cooperation Division, which deals with human rights issues at the country level and also incorporates human rights observation of U.N. peacekeeping operations, will be disbanded in Geneva and pieced off to the hubs.That division is headed by Anders Kompass, the senior human rights officer who kicked up a firestorm when he passed on an unredacted human rights report about alleged sexual abuse of children by non-U.N. peacekeepers in the Central African Republic to French authorities.For entire story: FOX News",politics,"Nov 20, 2015"

15215,SAY WHAT?! Muslim Women Can Now Cover Their Faces For License Picture In Obama’s Home State Of Illinois,"Soooo ah, what s the point of the picture?Not to worry though muslim women never commit acts of jihad right? To prevent religious discrimination, the state of Illinois plans to start mailing fliers to employees at offices that issue drivers licenses and photo IDs to remind them that people are not required to remove  articles of faith  for their photos. The state s efforts follow complaints from Muslim and Sikh agencies that some residents have been asked to remove religious head coverings.The Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund brought the issue to Illinois  Secretary of State s office about a year ago after Sikh residents complained that they had been asked to take off their dastaars, the turbans Sikhs wear around their heads, for photos. We had been getting complaints from around the states from Sikh Americans who were being asked to remove or modify their turbans to get their photo ID,  the executive director Jasjit Singh told Fusion Friday.Muslims became the state s fastest growing and third-largest group in 2012, according to the Chicago Tribune. And while there is no readily available state data about the Sikh population, there are half a million Sikhs living in the United States.A spokesperson for Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White emphasized to Fusion that it has always been illegal to ask people to remove their head covering, and that the fliers serve as a reminder for government employees of how to respect religious diversity. No change has actually taken place to our procedures,  said Henry Haupt, Deputy Press Secretary for the Secretary of State s office.  What we re doing was always allowed the religious head coverings of this nature but what we want to ensure is that the public s aware of them because we were told that some individuals were unaware that they could have their photo taken for the drivers license wearing them. We re always mindful of the fact that we want to communicate well with the public. Via: IB Times",politics,"Sep 11, 2015"

5504, Bombshell Report Shows GOP Presidential Campaign A Complete DISASTER In Multiple States,"Presidential elections are won by well-prepared, well organized multimillion dollar efforts that are executed at the state level. Some of the best models of this have been President Bush s campaign in 2004 and President Obama s campaigns in 2008 and 2012. What needs to be done and how it should be done are known by seasoned campaign operatives and candidates who put the people in place to make it happen.Donald Trump s presidential campaign, and the Republican Party s planning to help his campaign in multiple states that are key to winning, are a complete disaster with only four months to go until the election, according to a new report from the Associated Press.With early voting beginning in less than three months in some states, the review reveals that the national GOP has delivered only a fraction of the ground forces detailed in discussions with state leaders earlier in the year. And that is leaving anxious local officials waiting for reinforcements to keep pace with Democrat Hillary Clinton in the states that matter most in 2016.The Republican Party s massive failure gets even worse when you zoom in to swing states, as the Associated Press has:Some examples of Republican shortfalls: Ohio Republicans thought they were going to see 220 paid staffers by May; in reality there are about 50. Plans for Pennsylvania called for 190 paid staffers; there are about 60. Iowa s planned ground force of 66 by May actually numbers between 25 and 30. In Colorado, recent staff departures have left about two dozen employees, far short of the 80 that were to have been in place.AP even found that Trump s headquarters in Florida, one of the most important states in the fight for the electoral college, was closed and its voice mailbox full. Florida has 29 electoral votes and in 2012 was decided by a margin of 0.87 percent   on the ground organizing is key to winning it.These failures at the state organizing level don t even take into account the massive disparity in campaign advertising between Clinton and Trump. While she has been pumping out ads in important states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, Colorado, and New Mexico along with super PACs that support her, Trump hasn t been advertising at all. In 2012, Mitt Romney s campaign was outspent by President Obama, but he was actually spending money   Trump isn t spending on much, besides many of his own entities who showed up as campaign vendors.Republicans, especially in 2012, derided President Obama s background as a community organizer, but they could do with one right now to organize for their candidate in the communities he needs in order to have a chance at winning. That doesn t seem to be happening.Featured image via Flickr",News,"July 11, 2016"
5705," Supreme Court Strikes Down Texas Abortion Law, And Anti-Choicers Are Positively FUMING (TWEETS)","The Supreme Court sided with women on freedom and the right to choose today with their ruling on Texas  restrictive abortion law. In a 5-3 ruling, they said that the arguments that the law merely protects women s health are actually just a substantial burden on women seeking abortions. Since abortion is a constitutional right, no matter what the right-wing thinks, Texas  law was deemed unconstitutional.Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the majority opinion, and said: There was no significant health-related problem that the new law helped to cure. We agree with the District Court that the surgical-center requirement, like the admitting-privileges requirement, provides few, if any, health benefits for women, poses a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions, and constitutes an  undue burden  on their constitutional right to do so. He was joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Anthony Kennedy, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Ginsburg wrote her own concurring opinion, where she said: When a State severely limits access to safe and legal procedures, women in desperate circumstances may resort to unlicensed rogue practitioners, faute de mieux, at great risk to their health and safety. The 5-3 decision isn t just a victory for women and women s rights, but it also shows that the Supreme Court would have struck the law down even with a full bench, and a staunch conservative in Scalia s place. Anybody who thinks that a full bench would have stopped this is living in Fantasyland.Even so, anti-choice conservatives are still busy trying to convince people that the law actually protected women. Nothing could be further from the truth, which is why this case went all the way to the Supreme Court. Yet, here they are, in all their righteous anger about it, claiming that today is a sad day for women all across the country.Texas Governor Greg Abbott said (all emphasis from The New York Times): The decision erodes states  lawmaking authority to safeguard the health and safety of women, and subjects more innocent life to being lost. Texas  goal is to protect innocent life while ensuring the highest health and safety standards for women. Senator John Cornyn seems to agree with that. He said: Today s ruling sets a dangerous precedent for states like Texas, which the Constitution makes clear should be free to pass laws that are in the best interests of our citizens. Common-sense requirements that abortion clinics be held to the same standards as other medical facilities put the health of the patient first, and today s decision is a step back in protecting the well-being of mothers across our state. You two just keep telling yourselves that.Of course, National Right To Life can always be counted on to provide total ignorance masquerading as sane, logical reasoning on the issue of abortion: How shabby are these abortion clinics that they cannot meet the minimum standards other outpatient surgical centers are required to meet, and just how bad are these abortionists that they can t get admitting privileges at a local hospital? As we saw with Kermit Gosnell in Philadelphia, it s clear that the lucrative abortion industry is not able or willing to police itself and allows filthy, deplorable conditions to go unchecked. Ah, yes, invoking Kermit Gosnell, as if he s the norm and abortion doctors who are actually ethical and competent are the exception. Don t they have more evidence than that? Oh, wait, no they don t. One case is more than enough for them to think they can justify destroying a woman s right to choose what she does with her own body.Over on Twitter, many are celebrating this as the victory for women it is, but there are still anti-choicers rearing their ugly heads with the same twisted logic, spinning this as a grave mistake endangering thousands of women. Or they re making the argument that this violates states  rights (or doing both).

The suit seeks an order forcing Selleck to stop using the district s water, plus reimbursement for the $21,685.55 it paid the investigator, with damages and other costs.But the suit is a civil action, not a criminal case. Ventura County sheriff s Capt. John Riley meanwhile told NBC News that the sheriff s office did investigate allegations of criminal water theft, but  we are unable to establish a crime was committed. The Ventura County district attorney s office also confirmed that no case has been referred to it for prosecution.Selleck hasn t responded to requests for comment, and it s unknown whether he has anything to do with the water truck, which is registered under a commercial license.Eric Bergh, the water district s manager of resources, said the suit wasn t meant to be an example of  drought shaming,  a peculiarly California activity in which people suspected of hogging water are publicly called out. Our policies have been on the books for decades,  Bergh said.  We just want any such activity to stop   that is the bottom line for us. It s really about doing the right thing and preserving our water supply for our users. Via: CNBC",left-news,"Jul 9, 2015"

Fortunately, the mainstream media isn t the only source of news Americans have anymore. Many in the conservative media have been exposing the truth about Mr. Khan since he went off the rails on his Trump bashing speech that night. Following his speech, many Americans with military ties felt compelled to respond. A US Marine and former Navy vet wrote a blistering letter to Mr. Khan. A mother of an active duty soldier wrote a powerful letter refuting Khan s words and questioning his intentions. As it turns out, they were correct about his politically motivated intentions. Khan s ties to the Clintons, the Saudi s and the Muslim Brotherhood are pretty alarming.WATCH HERE:https://youtu.be/xEZUYJSnIk0",politics,"Aug 4, 2016"

Stiffer penalties coming. https://t.co/yYxeXql3xL  Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) January 20, 2017 Stiffer penalties coming,  his tweet says.This week, the American-Statesman reported that she had notified the county that it would soon no longer be complying with federal agents  requests in many cases. The county consequently could lose up to $1.8 million in grants because the governor s office requires compliance in order to receive grants.Gov. Greg Abbott said via Twitter in response to the Statesman s report,  I m about to up the ante. No more sanctuary cities in Texas. Texas Governor Greg Abbott warned he would cut off aid to Sheriff Hernandez if she refused to cooperate with the Federal immigration agencies:https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=DXPmp2XIizk&pbjreload=10The Travis County sheriff s office has a $169 million budget, according to the county s budget website. The $1.8 million would represent 1 percent of that budget.Earlier: In a major policy shift that is already being met with controversy, Travis County Sheriff Sally Hernandez on Friday announced that she is scaling back the amount of aid her department provides federal immigration agents in detaining suspects who may be in the country illegally.Traditionally, the county has honored nearly all requests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hold a suspect booked into jail when agents have wanted to investigate their status further. However, effective Feb. 1, sheriff s officials will honor so-called immigration holds or  detainers  placed by federal authorities only when a suspect is booked into the Travis County Jail on charges of capital murder, aggravated sexual assault and  continuous smuggling of persons. Otherwise, federal agents must have a court order or arrest warrant signed by a judge for the jail to continue housing a person whose immigration status is in question, according to Hernandez s policy, which she released Friday. The public must be confident that local law enforcement is focused on local public safety, not on federal immigration enforcement. Our jail cannot be perceived as a holding tank for ICE or that Travis County deputies are ICE officers,  Hernandez said in a video announcement.  My Statesman",politics,"Jan 23, 2017"
15391,TRUMP’S CHOICE FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL Doesn’t Come From The Obama School Of Chicago Thug Justice,"The good news is, now that Obama s released all the criminals from jail, there should be plenty of room for Hillary, Eric Holder, Loretta Lynch, Lois Lerner, Barack Obama and his tax cheat buddy, Al Sharpton Even though he s just a presidential hopeful, Donald Trump has wasted no time telling America his top pick is for attorney general. And, if you were somehow involved in the Benghazi scandal or Hillary Clinton s email debacle, you d better watch out.In a Tuesday tweet, Trump said that he would pick South Carolina representative and chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi Trey Gowdy as his attorney general, were he to be elected president. @HillaryClinton s toast. Dems had better get the  B Team  off the bench. @TGowdySC (Trey Gowdy s Twitter username) for Attorney General under President Trump,  Trump tweeted.Rep. Gowdy, whose tenacious manner with liberals and Obama administration officials has earned him the nickname  The Bulldog,  has been a conservative favorite for quite some time now. In fact, before the 2014 Republican sweep of Congress, political action group the Tea Party Leadership Fund endorsed Gowdy to take over John Boehner s position as speaker of the House.While Gowdy didn t get that job, it might be even more satisfying seeing the South Carolina bulldog at Eric Holder s old desk, prosecuting all of those Democrats let slide during the Obama administration.Via: Conservative Tribune",politics,"Jul 30, 2015"
10128,THROWING GAS ON RACIAL FIRE? VA Police Confirm….Governor Terry McAuliffe LIED About Weapons Being Hid Around Charlottesville By White Nationalists,"Will the mainstream media report about this?Contradicting statements by Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, the Virginia State Police say they did not find caches of weapons stashed around Charlottesville in advance of last Saturday s deadly white nationalist rally.In an interview Monday on the Pod Save the People podcast, hosted by Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson, McAuliffe claimed the white nationalists who streamed into Charlottesville that weekend hid weapons throughout the town. They had battering rams and we had picked up different weapons that they had stashed around the city,  McAuliffe told Mckesson.McAuliffe s comments were picked up by other news outlets and spread through social media. But Corinne Geller, a spokesperson for the Virginia State Police, says that no such stashes were found. The governor was referring to the briefing provided him in advance of Saturday s rally and the extra security measures being taken by local and state police,  Geller tells Reason.  As a safety precaution in advance of August 12, such searches were conducted in and around Emancipation and McIntire Parks. No weapons were located as a result of those searches. The Virginia State Police also disputed McAuliffe s claims that Virginia State Police were underequipped to deal with the heavily armed militia members at Saturday s rally. The governor was referencing the weapons and tactical gear the members of various groups attending the rally had on their persons,  Geller says.  I can assure you that the Virginia State Police personnel were equipped with more-than-adequate specialized tactical and protective gear for the purpose of fulfilling their duties to serve and protect those in attendance of the August 12 event in Charlottesville. McAuliffe claimed in an interview with The New York Times that law enforcement arrived to find a line of militia members who  had better equipment than our State Police had.  In longer comments that were later edited out of the Times  story, McAuliffe said that up to 80 percent of the rally attendees were carrying semi-automatic weapons.  You saw the militia walking down the street, you would have thought they were an army,  he said.  Reason ",politics,"Aug 17, 2017"
16027,JPMORGAN CEO Blows Up at the DC Dysfunction: Tired of Listening to the ‘Stupid Sh*t’ [Video],"JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon went on a rant about the dysfunction in DC during the company s earnings conference call Friday: The U.S. has become  one of the most bureaucratic, confusing, litigious societies on the planet Dimon had been considered for a position in President Trump s cabinet. He s been an adviser to Trump too. While there are some things Dimon clearly disagrees with the president on, they are able to work together: He is the President of the United States. I believe he is the pilot flying our airplane,  Dimon said,  I would try to help any President of the United States because I m a patriot. During the bank s annual meeting in May, 2016, Dimon reportedly commented on what he thinks the government should work on:Dimon emphasized the areas he believes are in serious need of fixing, including education, infrastructure, and tax reform. Our corporate tax system is driving capital and brains overseas and excessive regulation is reducing growth and business formation particularly for small businesses. THE STUPID SH*T WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IN THIS COUNTRY It s almost embarrassment to be an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid s  we have to deal with in this country,  Dimon said in response to an analyst question. Since the Great Recession, which is now 8 years old, we ve been growing at 1.5 to 2 percent in spite of stupidity and political gridlock, because the American business sector is powerful and strong,  he said.  What I m saying is that it would be much stronger growth if there were more intelligent decisions and less gridlock. The executive of the U.S. banking giant cited travels to countries such as France, Argentina, Israel and Ireland. The U.S. has become  one of the most bureaucratic, confusing, litigious societies on the planet  and  it s hurting the average American that we don t have these right policies,  he said.JPMorgan Chase reported earnings that handily beat Wall Street estimates Friday. However, the bank lowered its forecast for lending revenue.DC has been in gridlock over the health care bill, which is holding up the passage of new legislation on tax reform. The Senate cut short its August recess by two weeks in order to deal with health care. There are about a dozen Senators opposed to the current bill citing the possibility that this new health care bill is  Obamacare lite . Senator Rand Paul has voiced strong opposition to this new bill.Here s the transcript from Dimon:Since the Great Recession which is now eight years old we ve been growing at 1.5 to 2% despite the stupidity and political gridlock. Because the American business sector is powerful and strong and is going to grow regardless of they went to feed their kids and want to buy home they want to do things the same as American businesses what I m saying is it would be much stronger growth had we made intelligent decisions and that gridlock, and thank you for pointing it out because I m going to be a broken record until this gets done, we are unable to build bridges, unable to build airports, not graduating.I was just in France, in Argentina, Israel, Ireland we met with the Prime Minister of India and China it s amazing to me that every single one of those countries understands that practical policies to promote business growth is good for the average citizens of those countries for jobs and wages and somehow this great American free enterprise system we no longer get it.My view is corporate taxation is critical to that by the way regarding capital brings overseas, which is why the $2 trillion overseas benefiting all these other countries don t like that, so if we don t get our act together we can still grow. It s just unfortunate but it s hurting us, it s hurting the body politic, it s hurting the average American that we don t have these right policies. So no in spite of gridlock we will grow at 1   or 2%.I don t buy the argument that we are relegated to this effort. We are not this administration can make breakthroughs in taxes and infrastructure ready for reform we have become one of the most bureaucratic confusing litigious societies on the planet it s almost an embarrassment be an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid s  we have to deal with in this country and at one point we have to get our act together. We won t do what were supposed to for the average Americans and unfortunately people write about this like corporations is not corporations competitive taxes are important for business and business growth which is important to jobs in wage growth and we should be making that along to every single one of you every time you talk to a client.VIA: CNBC",Government News,"Jul 14, 2017"

15617,[Video] HISPANIC CANDIDATE FOR SENATOR IN CA MAKES OFFENSIVE REMARK ONLY A DEMOCRAT COULD GET AWAY WITH,"This story would have been front page news across America today had a Republican running for Senate in California made these potentially career ending remarks. But then again, there s that whole double standard thing Loretta and her sister Linda, who made history in 2008 when they became the first sisters in Congress, penned a joint memoir  Dream in Color.  In the book, they bemoan their status as women who are apparently seen as sex objects.A U.S. Senate candidate from California is under fire after being caught on camera imitating a racial stereotype of Native Americans.U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez patted her mouth and made a whooping gesture while talking to a room full of people with ties to India   Indian-Americans, not American Indians   at the California Democratic Party s convention in Anaheim on Saturday, reports The Sacramento Bee. I am going to his office thinking that I am going to meet with a  ,  Sanchez said in the video, describing a meeting with a person whose heritage she d gotten confused. Then she placed her hand over her mouth and made an echo sound. Right? Because he said Indian-American. And I go in there and it was great. It was just great because he said,  I want to get my community involved.  Involved,  she continued. And that was the first time that we saw the Indian-American community really come,  the Democrat from Santa Ana added before the clip cut out.Sanchez s rival in the Democratic race to replace U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer called the incident  shocking. I don t know what to say to that,  said Attorney General Kamala Harris, whose mother is from India and father is African-American, reports The Sacramento Bee. It is shocking and there is no place for that in our public discourse,  she added.Sanchez, who d been meeting with delegates to start the shaping of her campaign, defended her actions. What I said was that I got a call from somebody from over the phone and he said,  I want to talk to you about having help from the Indian community,  and I thought he meant the American Indian community, in the sense of the Native American Indian community,  she said.When asked whether it was an appropriate gesture to make to any people, the 55-year-old replied:  I think that Native Americans have an incredibly great history, and a great presence in our country, and many of them are supporting our election.

8442, What Facebook Just Did About Guns Is Going To Drive The NRA Insane,"Facebook announced that it will be banning its users from arranging private gun sales over both the main Facebook site and its photo-sharing site Instagram.While these new rules do not apply to licensed gun dealers, who can still post with the stipulation that they do not conduct purchases on the site, it does apply to private one-on-one sales that do not require background checks in many states.What is very important is that the move covers gun parts and ammunition as well. The banning of ammunition sales is obviously effective since without massive amounts of bullets you can t have massive amounts of gun violence. The fact it applies to gun parts is significant as well. Federal law doesn t currently cover some gun parts, like an  unfinished lower receiver.  They are treated as  not a gun  if they are 80 percent or less complete. This allows them to be sold without serial numbers or background checks. If you provide the parts to someone who is experienced enough to complete them, you basically have what will make an untraceable gun. Afterward, they can be assembled with other parts into a fully functional firearm. Some websites even sell the machines to complete receivers and boast about the fact you can build unserialized firearms legally in your own home.Facebook s status as a non-governmental entity gives it more control over what it can allow on its network. It simply doesn t matter if a person s slightly unfinished gun parts are legal to sell to anyone without background checks. Facebook can restrict whatever they want, just like they do with marijuana, pharmaceuticals or other illegal material. This helps tremendously in curbing the ways federal law has failed us.Facebook s head of product policy, Monika Bickert, said  Over the last two years, more and more people have been using Facebook to discover products and to buy and sell things to one another. We are continuing to develop, test and launch new products to make this experience even better for people and are updating our regulated goods policies to reflect this evolution. Do you think that any Republicans will be boycotting Facebook now? What will their alternative be?featured image via wikicommons",News,"January 30, 2016"
2229," Trump To Gut Coast Guard, Airport Security, And FEMA To Fund Useless Border Wall","Donald Trump s obsession with building a massive expensive wall along the Mexican border is literally going to make America less secure.Despite claiming that he will beat back terrorism and keep Americans safe, Trump is drafting a budget proposal that would cripple three of the nation s most critical agencies that do way more to help Americans than any wall will ever do.The cost of Trump s wall is projected to reach past $20 billion. During the campaign, Trump repeatedly claimed that Mexico would pay for the wall, but it s clear now that American taxpayers will be footing the bill. And rather than create a new budget item, Trump is considering just cutting funding from existing national security and national emergency management agencies to use it to pay for the wall instead.On the chopping block includes the U.S. Coast Guard, a crucial branch of the military that patrols and secures our ports, coast lines, and waterways, defending them from potential terrorist attacks and rescuing people.This particular cut is fiercely opposed by Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter, who explained on CNN Wednesday why the Coast Guard is too important to slash. You have President Trump talking about security, criminal networks   that s what the Coast Guard does, literally!  Hunter said.  So how can the president talk about  stopping illegal immigration, illegal drugs, and criminal narco networks, and then say we re going to cut the military and cut the Coast Guard? The way you stop bad things from happening here is not directly on the border, necessarily. So this is nonsensical to me. But that s not all.According to the Washington Post,The proposal, drawn up by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), also would slash the budget of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which provides disaster relief after hurricanes, tornadoes and other natural disasters. The Coast Guard s $9.1 billion budget in 2017 would be cut 14 percent to about $7.8 billion, while the TSA and FEMA budgets would be reduced about 11 percent each to $4.5 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively.In regards to the Transportation Security Administration, Trump plans to cut post-9/11 programs, which includes a program that trains airline crews how to deal with hijackers, a program that funds the use of special law enforcement teams that sweep transportation hubs for potential threats prior to and during major events like an inauguration, a program that gives local law enforcement more ability to patrol in and around airports, and a program that funds the use of special TSA agents who are trained to specifically detect people exhibiting odd behavior at check-points.In other words, programs that  have been considered a vital piece of airport security and for preventing a repetition of the Sept. 11, 2001, hijackings So Trump is literally looking to sacrifice programs designed to prevent another 9/11 in order to build a wall that most experts consider useless in stopping immigration.Donald Trump is once again demonstrating that he cares more about himself than he does about the safety and security of the American people. The Coast Guard protects our coastal boarders from inside and outside threats. The TSA helps prevent another 9/11 attack from occurring on American soil. And FEMA responds to help Americans before, during, and after a disaster strikes. Gutting these agencies doesn t make America safer. It makes us more vulnerable and that appears to be exactly what Trumps wants.If it wasn t clear enough before, it definitely is now. Trump is the greatest threat to our national security.Featured image via Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images",News,"March 8, 2017"

1433," Putin Claims To Have Transcript Of White House Meeting, Available Only At Trump’s Request","Speaking at a press conference with visiting Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni in Sochi, Russia, Vladimir Putin has claimed that he has a transcript of Donald Trump s meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. Furthermore, Putin said he would be willing to provide a copy to the U.S. Congress. The only catch is that the request would have to come from Trump himself.The Trump administration came under fire for holding a meeting with Lavrov and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the Oval Office last week, a meeting that Russian media were able to attend, yet from which U.S. media were banned. The situation came to a head when it became clear that Trump had disclosed confidential details pertaining to ISIS during the session. Initially, the White House denied the scandal, only to later claim that it was  wholly appropriate  for the president to discuss such information with the Russians. At no time were intelligence sources or methods discussed and the President did not disclose any military operations that weren t already publicly known,  Trump s national security adviser H.R. McMaster said at a press conference on Monday.  The premise of that article is false that in any way the President had a conversation that was inappropriate or that resulted in any kind of lapse in national security. The Kremlin still denies that Trump shared any U.S. intelligence during the meeting, with Russian President Vladimir Putin downplaying reports as  political Schizophrenia,  however, Trump s comments still have not been made public. Now it seems Putin is willing to go a step further to help out. If the administration of the United States deems this possible, we will be ready to provide a transcript of the Lavrov-Trump meeting to the U.S. Senate and Congress,  Putin told reporters during the press conference in Sochi, adding  it will happen if the U.S. administration wishes so. Not everyone sees Putin s offer as particularly beneficial to Trump, who the FBI has now confirmed is under investigation over links to the Russians, especially U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee. Probably the last person the person [Trump] needs to vouch for him right now is Vladimir Putin,  Schiff told CBS s This Morning.  Sure, send it [the transcript] our way. But its credibility would be less than zero. Featured image via Lintao Zhang/Pool/Getty Images",News,"May 17, 2017"
3694, GOP Forgets Something EXTREMELY Crucial As They Celebrate Blocking Obama’s Overtime Rule,"It s a job killer. It s a small business killer. It will eventually kill America and America s working class, so a rule that Obama put in place via executive order, which expands overtime pay for salaried workers, must go. At least that s how pro-rich, trickle-down obsessed Republicans see it. And now they have reason to cheer   a federal judge in Texas has blocked that rule. It would have extended overtime pay to millions of American workers.There s a problem, though. A glaring one that Igor Volsky pointed out on Twitter. The very people that the GOP claims to represent, particularly now that Trump is president, are the ones who will be hurt the worst by blocking this rule. It raised the mandatory overtime threshold from $23,660 to $47,500.They ve also forgotten that they re far wealthier than the millions of people who would have benefited from this rule. Here are just three examples:Paul Ryan s net worth = $566,1038He s cheering that 187,000 Wisconsinites earning less than $47,476 won t get paid for working overtime https://t.co/Ea513ncXE1  igorvolsky (@igorvolsky) November 23, 2016Ted Cruz s net worth = $3,013,518He s cheering that 1,244,000 Texans earning less than $47,476 now won t get paid for working overtime https://t.co/fRw7dmh3gm  igorvolsky (@igorvolsky) November 23, 2016McCain s net worth = $19,642,067He s cheering that 258,000 Arizonians earning less than $47,476 won t get paid for working overtime https://t.co/DHm28iF4h9  igorvolsky (@igorvolsky) November 23, 2016Yes, Judge Amos Mazzant said the rule actually violated the overtime stipulations of the Fair Labor Standards Act because it applied a salary-only test to overtime pay instead of the current classifications which are based on job position.However, businesses often use that part of the FLSA to justify paying as many employees as possible a pittance. They either wrongly classify many employees as exempt when they shouldn t be under the law, or they change job titles to things like  manager  to justify making them exempt. Then they continue to pay a pittance and treat them like hourly employees. All of this is illegal.It s easy for Republicans to say that blocking the overtime rule will help these hardworking Americans keep their jobs. They never think about the fact that people don t have jobs because they think it ll be fun or because they re bored. People have jobs because they have to work to live.And it s time Republicans stop pretending that it s perfectly okay for workers to be unable to make ends meet despite working insane hours or multiple jobs, because hey, at least they have a job.Champions of the working class? Hardly. It s more important to continue letting business run amok and claim that they re reining in Obama s supposedly extreme use of executive power. This is same ol , same ol  from the GOP. The working class voters that voted Republican over their economic situations are the ones who will be hurt worst.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images",News,"November 23, 2016"

New Orleans Mayor Mitch LandrieuThe City of New Orleans removed the first of four Confederate monuments this morning in an effort to appease those who believe the monuments represent racism or pretty much anything else they object to. By erasing our past, do we change anything?Some on Twitter are saying: New Orleans starts taking down Confederate statues, like ISIS did in the Middle East removing the history of our lives. It s not that we can compare religious persecution to a cleansing of history but it does have some similarities.Emotions are running high because this involves a time in our history that brother fought brother and died Should we forget the struggle and refuse to honor those who fought and died? Isn t it true that we should always remember history and learn from it?We should also honor the soldiers who fought and died No matter what!A LETTER FROM A PATRIOT WHO MAKES THE CASE FOR KEEPING THE MONUMENTS:By William McMichaelAny Longhorn will proudly declare that The University of Texas is more than an academic institution. The University is a beacon   a promise that Texas will continue to produce citizens who care about its future. However, the removal of the Jefferson Davis statue from the Main Mall demonstrates that the university values its current students more than it does its future ones.I believe that society does well to relegate the memory of the Confederacy to museums. Its legacy haunts the United States in ways that many will never understand. Recent events demonstrate that our nation may never fully heal from the wounds that the Civil War inflicted. However, removing a statue does not equate to progress particularly when other symbols of Confederacy continue to stand on the South Mall.In fact, the crowd of students and professors that gathered to witness the statute s removal serves as clear evidence that the University worries more about public appearances than it does encouraging future generations to remember the achievements of the past. Much like the university, the Main Mall serves as more than a beautiful area of the campus. The university commissioned the mall as a memorial to the reconciliation of the North and South. Less than 50 years after the end of the Civil War, sons of Union and Confederate soldiers fought together on the fields of France during World War I. Their parents had taught them to hate each other, yet they persevered together to defeat a common enemy.The South Mall s designers arranged the statues in such a way that the sun set on the faces of the Confederacy, a sign that the era of Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, and Albert Sidney Johnston would no longer govern Texas. However, the sun rises on the faces of men who stood as symbols of Texas  hope for a progressive future: President Woodrow Wilson, Gov. Jim Hogg, and Senator John Reagan   a former Confederate sympathizer who encouraged Texas to rejoin the Union.The statues look center toward a statute of George Washington, the preeminent founder who warned of the dangers of national division. The Littlefield Fountain bears a Latin inscription that translates to read:  Short is the life given, but the memory of a life nobly surrendered is everything. Ultimately, the South Mall reminds viewers not to honor the errors of the past, but rather that Texas can triumph in spite of its past. Yet rather than explain the Main Mall s history and purpose to the public, the University allowed errant voices to rule the day. As a result, future generations will likely forget the Main Mall s importance altogether. The moral of the story will be no more.Longhorns, do not continue wasting time by fretting over appearances.

23077,HACKING DEMOCRACY? CIA Accusing Russia of Doing What Langley Does So Well,"Peter Certo Other WordsEven in an election year as shot through with conspiracy theories as this one, it would have been hard to imagine a bigger bombshell than Russia intervening to help Donald Trump. But that s exactly what the CIA believes happened, or so unnamed  officials brief on the matter  told the Washington Post.While Russia had long been blamed for hacking email accounts linked to the Clinton campaign, its motives had been shrouded in mystery. According to the Post, though, CIA officials recently presented Congress with a  a growing body of intelligence from multiple sources  that  electing Trump was Russia s goal. Now, the CIA hasn t made any of its evidence public, and the CIA and FBI are reportedly divided on the subject. Though it s too soon to draw conclusions, the charges warrant a serious public investigation.Even some Republicans who backed Trump seem to agree.  The Russians are not our friends,  said Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, announcing his support for a congressional probe. It s  warfare,  added Senator John McCain.There s a grim irony to this. The CIA is accusing Russia of interfering in our free and fair elections to install a right-wing candidate it deemed more favorable to its interests. Yet during the Cold War, that s exactly what the CIA did to the rest of the world.Most Americans probably don t know that history. But in much of the world it s a crucial part of how Washington is viewed even today.In the post-World War II years, as Moscow and Washington jockeyed for global influence, the two capitals tried to game every foreign election they could get their hands on.From Europe to Vietnam and Chile to the Philippines, American agents delivered briefcases of cash to hand-picked politicians, launched smear campaigns against their left-leaning rivals, and spread hysterical  fake news  stories like the ones some now accuse Russia of spreading here.Together, political scientist Dov Levin estimates, Russia and the U.S. interfered in 117 elections this way in the second half the 20th century. Even worse is what happened when the CIA s chosen candidates lost.In Iran, when elected leader Mohammad Mossadegh tried to nationalize the country s BP-held oil reserves, CIA agent Kermit Roosevelt led an operation to oust Mossadegh in favor of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The shah s secret police tortured dissidents by the thousands, leading directly to the Islamic Revolution in 1979.In Guatemala, when the democratically elected Jacobo Arbez tried to loosen the U.S.-based United Fruit company s grip on Guatemalan land, the CIA backed a coup against him. In the decades of civil war that followed, U.S.-backed security forces were accused of carrying out a genocide against indigenous Guatemalans. Chile s democratically elected leader Allende was murdered in a brutal CIA coup d etat on September 11, 1973 (Image Source: Evergreen.edu)In Chile, after voters elected the socialist Salvador Allende, the CIA spearheaded a bloody coup to install the right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, who went on to torture and disappear tens of thousands of Chileans. I don t see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its own people,  U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger purportedly said about the coup he helped orchestrate there.And those are only the most well-known examples Continue this article at Other WordsREAD MORE MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21WIRE 2016 FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER@ 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"January 3, 2017"
970, GOP Operative Connected To Trump’s Ousted Top Adviser Tried Obtaining Russian-Hacked Clinton Emails,"An explosive report in the Wall Street Journal explicitly links the Russian-hacked Clinton campaign emails with Trump s campaign   and Michael Flynn s chances of ending up in prison just skyrocketed.According to the report, a GOP operative, Peter Smith, who had worked with Flynn s consulting group asked computer experts to help him get a hold of the cache of hacked emails the Russian government stole from Clinton s campaign. To open doors to getting what he wanted, he name-dropped Michael Flynn, who at that point was working on Trump s campaign. Smith died recently, but not before handing the Wall Street Journal a bedside confession of sorts.Talking Points Memo summarizes the insane details of the scheme:In one recruiting email reviewed by the newspaper, Smith said Flynn s son, Michael G. Flynn, was helping with the effort. In another, Jonathan Safron, a law student who worked for Smith, included Flynn s consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, at the top of a list of websites of people working with the team. He said,  I m talking to Michael Flynn about this if you find anything, can you let me know?  Eric York, one computer security expert who said he searched hacker forums on Smith s behalf to try to dig up the emails, told the Journal.Here s where the other shoe drops, via WSJ:Those investigators have examined reports from intelligence agencies that describe Russian hackers discussing how to obtain emails from Mrs. Clinton s server and then transmit them to Mr. Flynn via an intermediary, according to U.S. officials with knowledge of the intelligence.It isn t clear who that intermediary might have been or whether Mr. Smith s operation was the one allegedly under discussion by the Russian hackers. The reports were compiled during the same period when Mr. Smith s group was operating, according to the officials.Trump actively encouraged Russian hackers to steal Clinton s documents during the campaign, but later claimed to not have anything to do with their release. Despite the denials, a mountain of circumstantial evidence and a number of questionable admissions from Trump s team have only stoked the flames that something was very wrong during the election. Much of his staff, including Vice President Mike Pence and Trump s own personal lawyer, have hired defense attorneys in preparation for the investigation into their involvement.This new information only further incriminates Flynn, who now goes from looking  pretty guilty  to  very guilty.  It also burns the last remaining bridges he may have had to save himself.Michael Flynn has toyed with taking a deal to turn on his former boss, but the FBI says it is not pursuing that relationship. There is a good possibility that, if these allegations bear fruit, Flynn winds up in jail for treason or something close to it.Now all eyes have turned to Trump himself, who seems consumed with protecting Flynn. By his own retelling, Trump fired then FBI Director, James Comey, because he wouldn t stop the Russia investigation. Comey has since testified that Trump specifically asked him to drop any investigation into Flynn (who has by now retroactively filed as a foreign agent working for Turkey s despotic regime).Spies, hackers, foreign agents, liars, thieves, and crooks   quite a group assembled by Trump, the man who only hires the best people.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"June 29, 2017"

6725, Maine’s Governor Somehow Gets More Racist: I Can’t Understand Indian People Without Interpreter,"Maine has a very bad governor (thanks Tea Party movement!) who just keeps getting worse.Republican Governor Paul LePage decided to take a cue from Donald Trump and spend the weekend mocking Indian people. Apparently drawing upon his own experiences   and warped by LePage s truly stunning level of racism, no doubt   he lamented the fact that restaurants hire immigrants. The problem, he said, was that he needs  an interpreter  to understand them. And, he added, people from India are  the worst ones. This is right on the heels of Donald Trump s latest stab at xenophobic nationalism when at a rally he put on a stereotypical Indian accent to lament the fact that he had spoken to someone outside of America to inquire about his credit card. (Part of his plan to Make America Great Again, is to bring telemarketing jobs back to the country. A job nobody wants.) The crowd ate it up. So, it seems, did LePage, whom recently accused Ted Cruz of  stabbing him in the back  and is a big fan of Trump.LePage has made a name for himself as both a terrible governor in the traditional sense (he s been nearly impeached a number of times and is universally loathed by both Republicans and Democrats in the state legislature), and an unrepentant racist. Already this year he made headlines for this astoundingly offensive rant: These are guys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty  these types of guys  they come from Connecticut and New York, they come up here, they sell their heroin, they go back home. Incidentally, half the time they impregnate a young, white girl before they leave, which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue we have to deal with down the road. He later said he didn t mean to say  white girl.  Then a few days later, he said screw it and admitted that he did mean white girls but only because he knew that would make the story sound scarier.In a twisted way, LePage is probably relieved that his racism is back in the news. His last act of infamy was blocking a bill that would provide life-saving drugs for opioid overdoses to addicts. His reasoning: Why bother saving them? They ll just overdose again.Paul LePage is the worst.Featured image via YouTube screengrab",News,"April 24, 2016"
22579,"Cruz & Kasich Quit: Trump Crushes Elite Establishment, #DropOutHillary Now Trending","21st Century Wire says The field is now clear for Trump to become the GOP presidential nominee.Watch a video of this report here:Ted Cruz and John Kasich have both now bowed out of the presidential race, leaving Donald Trump as the last Republican candidate standing.The two failing candidates made their decision after Trump swept to victory in Indiana last night.Dr. Inderjeet Parmar, Head of the Department of International Politics at City University London, says that,  it has exposed a deeply divided Republican party whose leadership has lost all credibility and whose conservative philosophy, which it has held dear since 1980, is in tatters. It is, indeed, the elite leadership of both political parties that appears to have provoked this realignment in US politics towards outsiders and those not embroiled in what many see as a corrupt and broken system.Bernie Sanders, the Democratic outsider, also shocked the world with a victory over Hillary Clinton last night.Just two weeks ago Cruz and Kasich were publicising that they had made a deal to stop Trump, yet even their combined efforts were useless.Yesterday, a Rasmussen poll emerged showing that Donald Trump can indeed beat Hillary Clinton at the general election, and that scenario is looking ever more likely with the political establishment in such dramatic retreat.It is possible that Bernie voters will not support Hillary in the general election, and in many ways their anti-establishment position gels much better with the politics of Trump than it does with Wall Street insider Clinton.Immediately after Kasich s announcement today, #DropOutHillary began trending on Twitter. At the time of writing it is the number two trending hashtag in the US with 102,000 tweets.With such an immediate response taking aim at another establishment figure, the chances of Trump, or perhaps even Sanders, taking the presidency seem higher than ever.GET THE FULL STORY ON THE ELECTION: 21st Century Wire 2016 Election Files",US_News,"May 4, 2016"
1680," Sean Spicer Baffles Reporters, Claims Trump Isn’t Responsible For Hiring Flynn (VIDEO)","On Tuesday, White House Propaganda Minister Sean Spicer once again baffled reporters and other thinking individuals by once again saying the dumbest thing imaginable.Asked why the White House refuses to provide documents related to former National Security Advisor and registered foreign agent Michael Flynn s hiring, Spicer took the tried-and-true route of blaming President Obama.Spicer explained that the Trump White House isn t responsible for anything related to Flynn s hiring because the documents were filled out   during the Obama administration  and  those are not documents that the White House would ever possess. Everything that the White House has been asked to do, the only documents that were made available to [Congress] that they asked for were the ones that the Department of Defense had,  Spicer said, explaining that he doesn t feel that the White House has an obligation to provide the information Congress has requested. How about these calls made where [Flynn] was working during the transition on behalf of a future President Trump?  CBS s Major Garrett asked.  Aren t those things that you should have some responsibility or obligation to provide if you can? It s a question [of] if you can,  Spicer said.  To ask for every call a national security adviser made is pretty outlandish. Those calls were made on behalf of the Trump transition were they not?  Garrett asked. Spicer, of course, told him that Trump isn t responsible for anything that happened before January 20 even if it was done by a member of the Trump transition team. When?  Spicer asked.  We started this administration on Jan. 20. All the information that they re talking about occurred prior to him being at the White House. Working for the transition!  Garrett pressed. Not at the White House!  Spicer snapped.  Everything that is being questioned occurred prior to Jan. 20th. Trump and his White House are absolutely responsible for Flynn   which is not good, as even Hillary Clinton witch hunter, Congressman Jason Chaffetz, admits that Flynn likely committed crimes.Watch this all happen below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 25, 2017"
4405," Trump Explodes In Rage At Debate Results, Indicates He WON’T Accept An Election Loss (DETAILS)","We all know that Donald Trump s skin is very thin. He is also a narcissist the likes of which the world has never seen on the word leadership stage. Therefore, the thought of losing the 2016 presidential election has likely not really occurred to him in any real sense. However, his disastrous debate performance, combined with a huge tilt away from his favor in the polls following a week of chaos that was completely his own doing means that a loss in November is looking more and more likely. The Donald just cannot take that, though, so he has a new solution in the event of his losing the electon: he just won t accept the result.At the debate, in which Trump seemed to run out of gas and eventually melt down completely, he still nonetheless said he would accept the results should he lose to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. However, now that it seems that a loss might be something that is looming, Trump is going back on his loss. According to the New York Times, Trump s assessment is thus:Mr. Trump, aiming to unnerve Mrs. Clinton, even indicated that he was rethinking his statement at their last debate that he would  absolutely  support her if she won in November, saying:  We re going to have to see. We re going to see what happens. We re going to have to see. So, in other words, Trump is sending a dog whistle fog horn to his most ardent, hateful, aggressive, and uneducated supporters that says just what they already believe: if he doesn t win, it was rigged. This is beyond dangerous, considering that we can never plant the seeds of doubt in the integrity of our electoral system and process. While we all know that things like Voter ID laws and false accusations of voter intimidation most definitely are aimed at disenfranchising minority voters because they largely tend to vote left, there is absolutely nothing to suggest that anything more nefarious is going on regarding election rigging.Trump s inability to accept that no one   not even him   wins all the time is downright dangerous. It cannot be stressed enough that we must trust the result of this election, and every election, no matter how unsatisfied we might be with the outcome. That means that if folks like me wake up on November 9th to headlines of President Trump, I must accept it, and if I cannot tolerate it, I must move to another country.Trump s supporters must do the same. They have shown themselves to be violent, paranoid, hateful, and ignorant, though, so it will be no surprise if they refuse to accept any outcome of the 2016 presidential election beyond the one they desire. This is simply further proof that Donald Trump s candidacy is dangerous. I shudder to think what will happen if he is actually elected president.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"October 1, 2016"

There was a grand theory the law would reduce ER visits,  Dr. Howard Mell, a spokesman for the American College of Emergency Physicians, told the Journal.  Well, guess what, it hasn t happened. Visits are going up despite the ACA, and in a lot of cases because of it. Emergency-room visits continued to climb in the second year of the Affordable Care Act, contradicting the law s supporters who had predicted a decline in traffic as more people gained access to doctors and other health-care providers.A survey of 2,098 emergency-room doctors conducted in March showed about three-quarters said visits had risen since January 2014. That was a significant uptick from a year earlier, when less than half of doctors surveyed reported an increase. The survey by the American College of Emergency Physicians is scheduled to be published Monday.Medicaid recipients newly insured under the health law are struggling to get appointments or find doctors who will accept their coverage, and consequently wind up in the ER, ACEP said.

He hears things in clips and talking points, and then spews them out to the world, usually via Twitter, without thinking about the weight of his actions.One of the things Trump has been hung up on lately is Canada taking control of their dairy. According to Business Insider: Last year, Canada implemented a policy that created a new class of milk prices for ultra-filtered milk, a liquid, high-protein concentrate sometimes used to make products such as cheese and yogurt. Canada lowered the prices for this milk class, so as to incentivize domestic ultra-filtered milk and better compete with the US-produced imports. How dare they, right? The United States should not only legislate in their own country regarding the market but also around the world. At least that s what Trump seems to think.So Trump, trying to puff his chest and seem like he s a tough guy, tweets out: Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult.

Meanwhile, back in Washington it s all about Trump and Russia, Russia, Russia.The Obama administration has been accused of sabotaging an operation to stop Hezbollah smuggling drugs into the US so that the nuclear deal with Iran could proceed.In a stunning expos  by Politico, the former US President s officials are said to have opened the door for trafficking and money laundering operations by the terror group founded by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard.The nuclear deal agreed to scrap crippling economic sanctions on Iran in return for a promise from to Tehran to stop nuclear development. By putting themselves between the DEA and Hezbollah, the Obama administration helped the militant group grow into a global security threat that is suspected of designing IEDs used to kill American troops, the report said. Donald Trump s White House slapped at his predecessor Sunday night, with press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeting that the story shows a contrast of  President Trump s success against ISIS vs. President Obama s appeasement of terrorists. And a Republican House leadership aide told DailyMail.com on Monday that the Obama White House  was the worst of the worst when it came to fighting terrorism in the ways that mattered most. The Drug Enforcement Administration led a complex venture called Project Cassandra to tackle the criminality of the Lebanese militant group from 2008 on.But it is claimed Obama s people threw down a number of roadblocks, effectively paving the way for Hezbollah s illegal activities including cocaine smuggling into the US which agents believe raked in $1 billion for the terror group. DEA agents claim the Obama administration stopped them arresting key figures linked to Hezbollah as an agreement on the Iran nuclear deal approached   and scrapped Project Cassandra entirely once the terms were agreed in 2015. Hezbollah s $1 billion-a-year international criminal operation.

They serially ripped apart this entire effort that was very well supported and resourced, and it was done from the top down. He added that the closer Obama came to finalizing the Iran nuclear deal, the more difficult the DEA s job became.The weapons agreement was announced in January 2016, which coincided with Project Cassandra officials being moved on to other assignments.

3302, Obama Just Completely F*cked Over Trump’s ‘Muslim Registry’ Plan,"Donald Trump was really looking forward to using a dormant regulation as the basis for his Muslim registry. While The Donald planned to resurrect the Bush-era National Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS)   a program that was condemned heavily for targeting Muslims   Obama decided that he might as well just eliminate it before Trump can make good on his promise to bring it back.On Thursday, the Department of Homeland Security published a new regulation that completely eliminates NSEERS, which has lain dormant since President Obama suspended the program in 2011:The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is removing outdated regulations relating to an obsolete special registration program for certain nonimmigrants. DHS ceased use of the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS) program in 2011 after finding that the program was redundant, captured data manually that was already captured through automated systems, and no longer provided an increase in security in light of DHS s evolving assessment of the threat posed to the United States by international terrorism. The regulatory structure pertaining to NSEERS no longer provides a discernable public benefit as the program has been rendered obsolete.Accordingly, DHS is removing the special registration program regulations.The best part? This new rule takes effect almost immediately, so there is nothing at all Trump can do to stop Obama from scuttling his hopes of using NSEERS to create his Nazi-esque program.This seems to be a response to a plea from New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman to President Obama. In a letter addressed to the President, Schneiderman pointed out (very correctly): We can t risk giving President-elect Trump the tools to create an unconstitutional religious registry. Schneiderman praised the President s decision Thursday: This is a win for civil rights and for smart, effective law enforcement, as well as for the strong coalition of advocacy organizations and others who fought to dismantle this discriminatory tool,  he said.  My office will continue do everything it can to protect the rights of all New Yorkers, and ensure equal justice under the law for all, regardless of religion or national origin.

He raced to Twitter to let his eager followers know exactly what his plans were as the most powerful man in the world:Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 21, 2017That s right! Donald Trump will finally be opening that presidential book hidden in the Library of Congress (and found by Nicolas Cage) that contains all of the secrets passed down from president to president across the ages to reveal what really happened to JFK.Just kidding! Despite the fact that he tried to make it sound like it was his idea, and happening only under his authority, it turns out that the  JFK FILES,  as he so loudly put it, were scheduled to be released no later than next Thursday, October 26, 2017. Coincidentally, that date is exactly 25 years to the day after the  President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992  was passed by the 102nd Congress.Okay, I m kidding again. Democratic Senator and American hero John Glenn introduced the bill in July of that year   likely while production was wrapping up on Donald Trump s star cameo in the Hollywood blockbuster  Home Alone 2: Lost In New York. Especially relevant in the text of the bill is Section 2, which discusses the reasoning behind Senator Glenn s proposal of it.Isn t it weird, how Trump really emphasized the fact that the  JFK FILES  were  long blocked and classified  and that he was gonna do something about it? I mean, besides the fact that all he s actually doing is allowing an existing law to, uh, continue to exist and carry out as planned. No, what s weird is WHO  long blocked and classified  those files. John Glenn (who may or may not know the truth about the moon landing) was kind enough not to name the sitting president he was indicting in this bill for obstructing the files  release, but the math is pretty simple: From July to October of 1992, the entire time this bill was debated until its passage, the person referred to as  the executive branch  was former president (and even former-er CIA Chief) George H.W. Bush.A Republican. As usual.Anyway, thanks, Trumpykins! We really appreciate you, uh, not stopping this thing that was totally going to happen even if you d been hit by a meteor the day you admitted you were a sexual predator. I wonder how long the presidential records on all the crimes you ve committed since your inauguration will remain sealed.Featured image via Chris Kleponis (Pool)/Getty Images",News,"October 21, 2017"
15079,WHY REUTERS IS SAYING With “reasonable confidence” A Republican Will Win The White House In 2016,"After examining the data Reuters used to make their bold prediction, we noticed they hadn t given any consideration to the high probability that Democrats will likely find a way to give illegal aliens the opportunity to cast their ballots in 2016. Illegal alien voters aside, here is Reuters interesting (and somewhat hopeful) study Elections are not mysterious events subject to the whimsy of unpredictable candidates and voters. They re actually highly predictable, with a set of variables that influence outcomes in familiar ways.Because of that, we can say, with reasonable confidence, that a Republican will be moving into the White House in 2017.That conclusion is based on the results of a data model we created, and is primarily the result of two factors, both related to the challenges faced by  successor  candidates   candidates from the same party as the incumbent. First, a Republican will win because voters typically shy away from the party currently in power when an incumbent isn t running. In fact, a successor candidate is three times less likely to win. Second, President Barack Obama s approval ratings are too low to suggest a successor candidate will take the White House.Why are we so confident, especially when opinion poll data now gives Hillary Clinton the edge over most Republican opponents? The simple answer is that we re relying on models, not polls.At this point in the election cycle, poll data asking the  horserace  question ( Who will you vote for in November 2016? ) can be very misleading. This far from Election Day, published poll data is off by an average of 8 percentage points compared with the true election outcome. That s an enormous number when we re used to elections where candidates win by two to three points.Time Before Election Average error of polls (compared to final results)One week 1.7%One month 2.7%Two months 3.8%Three months 4.8%Six months 5.8%Nine months 6.9%Twelve months 7.9%Source: Ipsos analysis of 300 polls across 40 markets from 1980 through currentModeling results is a simple concept: look at past data, identify patterns, and use those patterns to make predictions. So we begin by aggregating data from past U.S. presidential elections, but are immediately hampered by the fact that there aren t very many elections to work from   25 if we go back 100 years.So we created a much larger database of elections by looking beyond the United States to hundreds of presidential and parliamentary elections in democratic countries around the world. This exercise gave us far more data to work with: a sample size of more than 450 elections from 35 countries.The most important finding from our model is the power of incumbency: if you already hold the office you seek, you are far more likely than not to retain it. Our model showed that incumbents have a threefold greater chance of beating their opponent. When no incumbent is running, successor candidates (in this case, Democrats) are three times less likely to win.Our model proves the power of presidential approval ratings. It determines that in order for a successor candidate to have better than even chances of winning, the sitting president must have an approval rating of above 55 percent. Because Barack Obama s average approval rating is now at 45 percent, a successor candidate (i.e. Democrat) is unlikely to win.President (Govt) approval rating INCUMBENT probability of victorySUCCESSOR probability of victory40% 55%6%45% 78%14%50% 90%28%55% 96%49%60% 98%71%Source: Ipsos analysis of over 450 elections since 1938Our model works on the basis of probabilities, and is focused at the party level rather than the candidate level. It seeks only to predict the likelihood of a change to the party in power. It has an 85 percent predictive ability, so it s right most   but not all   of the time. Things that could confound the model include rapid changes to Obama s approval rating, or unusually high or low turnout (which can be driven by  wild card  candidates or other factors).In the coming months, Obama s approval ratings may tick up. But they would have to pass the 55 point mark to give the Democrats even odds of keeping the White House. This is extremely unlikely, given the fact that presidential approval typically declines over time, and Obama s ratings are no exception.Some will argue that Hillary Clinton is special; that her chances are significantly better because, given her popularity and status as a  legacy  candidate, she seems more like an incumbent. But if we go along with that hypothesis and run it through our model, at Obama s current approval ratings, Clinton s chances of winning the general election are still less than half.The Democrats have quite a mountain to summit to retain power past 2016.Via: Reuters",politics,"Oct 17, 2015"

52, Americans Once Elected A President After He Was Accused Of Raping A 13-Year-Old Girl,"After an awful campaign filled with hateful rhetoric, American voters elected a man to lead the most powerful country on earth even after he was accused of raping a 13-year-old. The year was 2016 and the accused was an alleged billionaire, former reality show star and an admitted sexual predator. Still, even after the revelations, conservatives saw nothing wrong with Donald Trump s behavior. The plaintiff described the horrifying incident in which Trump and his friend Jeffrey Epstein allegedly raped a child. A lawsuit was filed which claims that threats were made in order for the victim to keep her mouth shut about what had just happened.Both Defendants let Plaintiff know that each was a very wealthy, powerful man and indicated that they had the power, ability, and means to carry out their threats. Indeed, Defendant Trump stated that Plaintiff shouldn t ever say anything if she didn t want to disappear like Maria, a 12-year-old female that was forced to be involved in the third incident with Defendant Trump and that Plaintiff had not seen since that third incident, and that he was capable of having her whole family killed.There was a witness who backed up  Jane Doe s  claims. According to the lawsuit, Trump and Epstein  sexually and physically  abused the then 13-year-old plaintiff and forced her  to engage in various perverted and depraved sex acts    including being  forced to manually stimulate Defendant Trump with the use of her hand upon Defendant Trump s erect penis until he reached sexual orgasm,  and being  forced to engage in an unnatural lesbian sex act with her fellow minor and sex slave, Maria Doe, age 12, for the sexual enjoyment of Defendant Trump    after luring her to a  series of underage sex parties  by promising her  money and a modeling career,  according to Snopes.Trump has admitted knowing Epstein for 15 years. Epstein was named in multiple similar lawsuits, served 13 months in jail, and is registered as a sex offender for life.The lawsuit which was filed in California on April 26, 2016, was dismissed over technical filing errors and it was refiled in June of the same year, then dropped again in November after the plaintiff received death threats.Last year, Trump was also accused by 16 women of sexually harassing or assaulting them. Conservatives went on to elect him knowing full well that he is a sexual predator because he said so in the Access Hollywood tape.History will not be kind as it remembers November of 2016.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.",News,"November 29, 2017"
21746,WHY WAS THIS YOUNG MAN SPONSORED BY CAIR INVITED TO THE WHITE HOUSE,"It s Hard To Know Who Obama Hates More America, Israel Or Our Police Officers Barry doesn t have time to attend the funerals of any of the cops who ve been murdered in his race war, but he s got time to meet with a CAIR sponsored victim of alleged police brutality following a violent protest, supposedly at the hands of Israel police officers. He s always got time for the  victim,  especially if the radical muslim organization, CAIR has anything to do with using the victim s status to promote their radical cause. A White House official confirmed that the Obama administration s national security team recently met with a teenager who garnered international headlines after a video of him being beaten by Israeli police during a protest in East Jerusalem emerged on the Internet.Tariq Khdeir, a fifteen-year-old Tampa resident of Palestinian decent, was hosted at the White House for continuing meetings with the Obama administration, which says that it is continuing to monitor the case.Khdeir was filmed being beaten and arrested by Israeli police last summer during a riot in a Palestinian neighborhood over the death of Muhammad Abu Khdeir, Tariq s cousin.A White House official confirmed late Monday to the Washington Free Beacon that Khdeir and his family were hosted at the White House for meetings. The confirmation came following initial reports of the April 15 meeting by CNN. The U.S. government has remained closely engaged with Tariq and his family since his return from Jerusalem,  a White House official told the Free Beacon.  As part of the follow-up on pending issues related to his case, National Security Council staff met with the Abu Khdeir family recently. While Tariq Khdeir was originally accused of participating in the riot which came amid a series of similar riots in Jerusalem last summer he was cleared of all charges in January.Khdeir s cousin Muhammad was the victim of an apparent revenge killing in the wake of the abduction and slaughter of three Israeli teens by Palestinian terrorists.Anti-Israel activists touted the video of Khdeir s beating as proof of widespread Israeli aggression and malfeasance in East Jerusalem. Organizations such as the Council of America-Islamic Relations (CAIR) have featured Khdeir as a speaker at various anti-Israel conferences.The family is reportedly seeking assurances that Khdeir will not be subjected to retaliation by Israel should he return to Jerusalem.The Obama administration is reportedly miffed with Israel over the incident and believes the government has not taken such incidents seriously, according to CNN. Based on numerous conversations with administration officials on background, there is a widespread belief within the Obama administration that the Israeli government does not take these incidents against American citizens with the seriousness U.S. officials believe they merit,  CNN reported. Unless there is video evidence that excessive force was used, as in the case of Tariq Khdeir, Israeli government officials inevitably conclude that the action taken was justified and in keeping with national security needs, officials say,  according to the report.Via: Washington Free Beacon",left-news,"May 12, 2015"
8360," Loser Trump EXPLODES On Twitter, Claims Ted Cruz ‘Illegally Stole’ Iowa (TWEETS)","When Donald Trump stepped on the stage in Iowa Monday night, we almost thought he might behave like an adult after being defeated by Ted Cruz. He gave a very, very short speech (a strange breath of fresh air after Rubio s), and stayed pretty upbeat and positive   until Tuesday.The day after his loss Trump started tweeting whining about losing. In one tweet he claimed that the people of Iowa didn t appreciate that he hadn t taken money from super PACS. He even implied that he was wasting his money by self-funding his campaign.On Wednesday morning, Trump continued his temper tantrum and tweeted that Cruz  stole  the caucus. Ted Cruz didn t win Iowa, he illegally stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong any why he more votes than anticipated. Bad! Shortly after the tweet went out, he deleted it and posted one that left the word  illegally  out.Ted Cruz didn t win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016But he couldn t leave it at just one tweet, he kept going:During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016 Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016 And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and  choice    a total lie!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016The butthurt is so strong there.He is acting exactly the way we thought he would act if he lost, only it s even more pathetic than we could imagine. Instead of behaving like an adult and moving on, he is literally acting like a raging toddler. Ted Cruz came out on top because the Republicans in Iowa are  ber conservative   Trump is not. Perhaps he also lost because of his brilliant dumbass decision to skip the last debate (over more hurt feelings).Whatever the reason, voters are not going to look at his recent behavior and think, Yep, this is the guy we want with the nuclear codes. This meltdown is just solidifying the fact that he definitely doesn t belong in the White House. Featured image from Rolling Out ",News,"February 3, 2016"
11158,COLLEGE SNOWFLAKES FREAK OUT! “Feel Unsafe” Over VP Pence’s Planned Commencement Speech [Video],"Notre Dame students are freaking out over Vice President Pence s planned commencement speech. Once again, the college snowflakes are trying to shut down free speech. How will these students ever survive in the real world?The college is breaking with a 60-year tradition by not inviting the sitting president to speak. Instead, the University President announced Pence s scheduled visit noting he s a  native son : It is fitting that in the 175th year of our founding on Indiana soil that Notre Dame recognize a native son who served our state and now the nation with quiet earnestness, moral conviction and a dedication to the common good characteristic of true statesmen,  said Notre Dame President Rev. John I. Jenkins, C.S.C.  With his own brand of reserved dignity, Mike Pence instilled confidence on the state level then, and on the world stage now. We are proud to welcome him to represent the new administration. Notre Dame students protesting VP Pence as this year s commencement speaker because it makes them  feel unsafe  pic.twitter.com/W7mJoFp6dV  FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) April 12, 2017 University of Notre Dame students have begun a  #NotMyCommencementSpeaker  white board campaign to protest the invitation of Vice President Mike Pence to speak at Commencement.Last week, seniors Immane Mondane and Jourdyhn Williams invited students to take photos holding white boards with  direct quotes from Pence that are racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, offensive, or ostracizing to members of our community,  along with the hashtag  #NotMyCommencementSpeaker. Alternatively, students could also write about why they  feel unsafe with the presence of Mike Pence on our campus,  with daily opportunities to have photos taken with their whiteboards through the week.Once all the photos have been compiled, the organizers plan to share them on social media in hopes of starting a  discussion  about Pence s invitation. For me personally, Pence represents the larger Trump administration,  Mondane told The Observer.  His administration represents something, and for many people on our campus, it makes them feel unsafe to have someone who openly is offensive but also demeaning of their humanity and of their life and of their identity. While the photos do not appear to have been posted yet, Mondane provided The Observer with several examples of the complaints that students shared.One student used a quote from Pence favoring traditional marriage, writing on their board,  Congress should oppose any effort to put gay and lesbian relationships on an equal status with heterosexual marriage  -Pence #NotMyCommencementSpeaker.

22814,Charlottesville and the Problem of Left & Right Identity Politics in America,". By Gilad AtzmonIn my recent book Being in Time   a Post Political Manifesto, I pointed out that the West and America in particular have been led into a disastrous Identity (ID) clash. This week in Virginia we saw a glimpse of it.In the book I argue that the transition from traditional Left ideology into New Left politics can be understood as the aggressive advocacy of sectarian and divisive ideologies. While the old Left made an effort to unite us all: gays, blacks, Jews or Whites into a political struggle against capital, the New Left has managed to divide us into ID sectors. We are trained to speak  as a :  as a Jew,   as a black,   as a Lesbian.  The new left has taught us to identify with our biology, with our gender, sex orientation and our skin colour, as long as it isn t  White  of course.In Being in Time, I noted that it was a question of time before White people would also decide to identify with their biology. And this is exactly what we saw in Virginia last weekend.Tragically, ID politics is a very dangerous political game. It is designed to pull people apart. It is there to introduce conflict and division. ID politics doesn t offer a harmonious vision of society as a whole. Quite the opposite, it leads to an increasingly fractured social reality. Take, for instance, the continuous evolution of the LGBT group. It is constantly expanding to include more and more sectarian sexually oriented social subgroupings (LGBTQ, LGBTQAI and even LGBTQIAP ).In the New Left social reality, we, the people are shoved into ID ghettos that are defined by our biology: skin colour, sexual orientation, the Jewish mother, etc.Instead of what we need to do: fight together against big money, the bankers, the megacorporations, we fight each other, we learn to hate each other. We even drive our cars over each other.I am opposed to all forms of ID politics, whether it is White, Black, Jewish, Gender or sex oriented. But, obviously if Jews, Gays and others are entitled to identify with their  biology , white people are entitled to do the same. I think that universalism is what we used to call it when we still cared about intellectual integrity.The problem created by ID politics is extremely grave.ID politics doesn t offer a prospect of peace and harmony. Within the context of ID politics, we cannot envisage a peaceful resolution of the current ID clash. Can anyone foresee the LGBT community embracing KKK activists into their notion of  diverse society?  The same can be said about the KKK, are they going to open their gates to cultural Marxists?ID politics equals ID clash, an irreconcilable conflict with no end, the complete destruction of American and, to a certain extent, Western civilisation.  This may explain why George Soros and his open society are invested in this battle. As long as the working people are fighting each other, no one bothers to challenge the root cause of our current dystopia, namely the banks, global capitalism, wall street, Mammonism and so on.The remedy is clear. America and the West must, at once, break away from all forms of ID politics. Instead of celebrating that which separates us, we must seek what unites and makes us into one people.  I am advocating a radical spiritual, ideological and metaphysical transition. Whether or not we like to admit it, these moments of unity are often invoked by waves of patriotism, nationalism and religious figures. But they could also be inspired by the spirit of justice, equality compassion and love.  Neither the New Left or the Alt Right offers any of the above. They are equally invested in Identitarian ideologies. The electoral success of Trump, Corbyn and even Sanders or Le Pen points at a general human fatigue.  Readiness for change is in the air.This article was originally published at Gilad Atzmon s blog(An excerpt from Being in Time   a Post Political Manifesto  pg. 49) The Identitarian Shift & the Primacy of the Symptom  ID politics manifests itself as a set of group identification strategies. It subdues the  I  in favour of symbolic identifiers: the ring on the appropriate ear, the nose stud, the type of skullcap, the colour of the scarf and so on.Within the ID political cosmos, newly emerging  tribes  (gays, lesbians, Jews, Blacks, Whites,vegans, etc.) are marched into the desert, led towards an appealing  promised land , where the primacy of the symptom (gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, skin colour etc.) is supposed to evolve into a world in itself. But this liberal utopia is in practice a sectarian and segregated amalgam of ghettos that are blind to each other. It has nothing in common with the promised universal, inclusive cosmos. The personal is political,  as the common feminists and liberal preachers have disseminated since the 1960s, is a phrase designed to disguise the obvious; the personal is actually the antithesis of the political. It is, in fact, the disparity between the personal and the political that makes humanism into an evolving exchange known as history. Within the Identitarian discourse, the so-called  personal  replaces true and genuine individualism with phony group identification   it suppresses all sense of authenticity, rootedness and belonging, in favour of a symbolism and imaginary collectivism that is supported by rituals and empty soundbites.Why are we willing to subject ourselves to politics based on biology, and who wrote this new theology found in pamphlets and in the growing numbers of ID Studies textbooks? Is there a contemporaneous God? And who created the  pillar of cloud  we are all to follow?It is clear that elements within the New Left, together with Jewish progressives and liberal intelligentsia, have been at the heart of the formation of the ideological foundation of ID politics. At least traditionally, both Jewish liberals and the Left were associated with opposition to any form of exclusive political agenda based on biology or ethnicity. Yet, one may wonder why does the New Left espouse such an exclusivist, sectarian and biologically driven agenda?Gilad Atzmon s book Being In Time: A Post Political Manifesto is available now on: Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.com and gilad.co.uk.

7449, Former George W. Bush Speechwriter Epically Blasts Republicans For Supporting Trump,"This is a HUGE condemnation of the Republican Party.Ever since Donald Trump kicked off his campaign for the presidency, Republicans have cowered before him endorsing him one by one even after saying that they disagree with him and despise the divisive and hateful rhetoric he spews.But former George W. Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson put his writing skills to use on Thursday to pen an epic rebuke of Donald Trump and the Republicans who support him. Trump pretty much represents the negation of everything I ve argued about politics and ideology for the last 30 years,  Gerson wrote on Facebook.What he is attacking is not just  the establishment.  He is attacking a way of doing politics based on persuasion, consensus, compassion and inclusion. Those who argue that conservatism is fundamentally at odds with these values know nothing of conservatism. But Trump represents the confirmation of the worse conservative and Republican caricatures   a belief that cultural and religious minorities are threats, a belief that America should abandon its deepest values in the conduct of global affairs, a belief that the values and institutions of our government have failed, and that the times require a strong hand.Gerson continued ripping Trump for wanting to tear down what makes America great.At its best (and, God knows, it has not always been at its best) America shows a welcoming spirit, an example of how a great nation can be united by ideals instead of bloodlines, a place, as George Washington said, where  there shall be none to make him afraid.  We should love American traditions and institutions enough to repair them, not hand them over to an authoritarian wannabe, who is too ignorant to even understand the inheritance he is casting away.And then he really let Trump have it.Trump s magical policy thinking, setting goals with no serious thought of how they might be achieved; his menacing encouragement of political violence; his disdain for ethnic and religious minorities, which has unleashed and emboldened racists and anti-Semites of every sort; his penchant for conspiracy theories, including a very dangerous vaccine denialism; his promises to conduct the war on terrorism by ordering war crimes, which would set up a constitutional crisis when the US military honorably refuses; his cynical manipulation of gullible religious leaders with tactics that border on blasphemy; his casual use of lies, which he defends even when exposed.Gerson then turned his focus toward the GOP and slammed them for supporting Trump even though he represents the destruction of all the progress America had made since gaining independence from Great Britain and damned them to regret it for all of time.How does any of this return lost greatness to our nation? Sometimes I want to shake people (intellectually,not physically) who favor political  disruption  and ask: Disruption in favor of what? Look at what you are doing! Look at what you have done! The Republican Party is now firmly harnessed to the wild, uncontrollable horses of fear and exclusion. It has already sustained damage with Latino voters that may take a generation to undo. And now many Republicans will find rationalizations to support Trump. That is natural   the reality of politics in every time. Many people simply go with the winner. But this isn t a normal time. I believe that the decision to support Trump, like an embarrassing tattoo, will follow them the rest of their lives. Republicans are not merely making a choice; they are looking into the abyss.Here s the full post via Facebook.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); // ]]&gt;I feel bad, on one hand, to be so focused on (some would say, obsessed by) the Trump phenomenon. And it is my intention Posted by Michael J. Gerson on Thursday, March 17, 2016Gerson ended his post by leaving a link to an op-ed he wrote for the Washington Post in which he says Republicans are staining themselves by supporting Trump and that perhaps one of the only honorable option left to save themselves from being forever remembered as the party that destroyed America is to vote for Hillary Clinton.Seriously, Republicans.

3058," Dan Rather Responds To Trump’s Sex Tape Allegations, Visibly DISGUSTED In Interview (VIDEO)","Yesterday, Buzzfeed News released a report that stated Russia might be trying to blackmail President-elect Trump due to a very compromising sex tape involving urination, prostitutes and his hatred for President Barack Obama.Since these allegations were released and have made rounds all over the internet, Trump and his transition team have been working around the clock to dispute Buzzfeed s report and convince America that those claims are untrue. It s going horribly, considering Trump has decided to fight the report by foolishly tweeting, creating even more controversy and drawing more attention to himself.One person who has always been amazing at criticizing Trump in the most logical, sound way is legendary news reporter Dan Rather. There would be no one better to ask about the latest allegations, and TMZ happened to nab a short interview with him as he was leaving 30 Rock to ask him what he thought of the latest Trump scandal.Rather was careful to emphasize that the allegations were in fact just allegations at this point, and have not been confirmed. However, he made sure to state that Trump s presidential transition has been unlike any other in so many ways   and none of them are good. Rather said that regardless of whether these allegations are true or not: In some ways the damage has already been done, because it gets people talking about it. So, what a crazy week. What s happening with this transition of power and what s happening this week is unprecedented on steroids. I ve never seen anything like it. For Rather   who has seen quite a bit throughout his career as a reporter -c- to say that he s never seen anything come even close to the scandals and corruption that have followed Trump throughout his campaign and transition is shocking. Trump s supporters may have been fooled when they voted for him, but they re getting a horrifying look at their future President now.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"January 11, 2017"

Suddenly, Bernie had enough money to buy 3rd home on beautiful Lake Champlain, where the one-percenters Bernie rails against call home. What s in it for Bernie now? Why, after months of being silent, is he hitting the campaign trail for Hillary? Could he and his lovely wife be in the market for a 4th home? Perhaps he s vying a cabinet position? What about Secretary of Free Sh*t For Everyone? Who better for such a position than the self-described Socialist who rails against the 1%, while simultaneously enjoying the lifestyle of the rich and famous. Ahh the hypocrisy of the Left. There s nothing quite like it Hillary Clinton, campaigning here Wednesday with Sen. Bernie Sanders, worked to sway millennial voters by promoting a plan to make public college tuition-free for working families.In a University of New Hampshire gym packed with students, Clinton sought to connect with those facing sometimes insurmountable college debt. Clinton said that when she graduated from college herself, she repaid her loans as a percentage of her income, which allowed her to take a low-paying public service job with the Children s Defense Fund. I could never have done that if I had the kind of interest rates a lot of people are facing,  she told a crowd estimated at 1,200.  We are going to fix it. This is wrong. Clinton said when she taught law in Arkansas she met many students who scraped together money for tuition but were sidelined by financial hardships, including broken-down cars or child-care problems.Clinton noted that New Hampshire has the highest proportion of students with debt and the second-highest average debt per student. She said she aims to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for families earning less than $125,000 per year, to make community college free, and to help students refinance their college debt. When you add it up, our plan will help millions of people save thousands of dollars,  she said.

15481,WHY OBAMA IGNORED MURDER BY ILLEGAL ALIEN IN SANCTUARY CITY: You Have Never Seen Megyn Kelly This Mad Before!,"Fox News host Megyn Kelly shut down a liberal guest in a blistering Thursday night exchange about President Barack Obama s silence on the senseless killing of Kate Steinle at a San Francisco tourist area.Kelly observed that the president was only too willing to speak out on the Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Freddie Gray killings, but was noticeably silent on Steinle, who was killed by an illegal immigrant who d been deported five times and had seven felony convictions. When asked repeatedly this week to speak to this case, White House spokesman Josh Earnest declined to weigh in, other than to refer folks to the Department of Homeland Security,  Kelly said.  A stark contrast to what we saw after Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson [Missouri], a man we now know was attacking a police officer at the time of his death. Liberal talk show host Richard Fowler made the ridiculous claim that the woman would be alive today if Congress had passed immigration reform legislation. Stop that! Stop that! Stop that! Answer my question please,  Kelly said.  Give an answer! You can t!   There s no excuse for it! He picks and chooses the victims he wants to highlight. And apparently, this victim wasn t deemed worthy. When political consultant Marc Thiessen asked Fowler to explain his statement that Obama doesn t support sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants, Fowler veered off into left field and again brought up lack of immigration reform, placing the blame on Republican lawmakers for not acting on immigration reform. That s a dodge! Support what you just said, Richard!  Kelly shot back.  Stop it   You keep making these assertions and then you dance off to the sidelines. You said the president doesn t support sanctuary city policies. What do you base that on? I base it on the fact that if we had comprehensive immigration reform there would be no need for sanctuary cities,  Fowler repeated.  And I m pretty sure the White House would tell you the same thing tonight. Via: Breitbart News",politics,"Jul 11, 2015"
22138,Rappoport: ‘CNN Already Deflecting From the Susan Rice Scandal’,"By Jon RappoportCNN is already claiming the whole Susan Rice scandal is a tempest in a teapot, and the Trump team is exaggerating it to distract the public from  something. Fill in the blank yourself.For example: Trump isn t actually the president, he cheated his way into the Oval Office, while acting as a secret agent for his handler, Vladimir Putin, who in turn was operating on behalf of aliens from Jupiter.The Susan Rice scandal is out in the open. She, Obama s national security advisor, led an effort to spy on legal phone calls the Trump team was making during the presidential campaign, in order to gain  intelligence on the enemy. The Daily Caller News Foundation (DCNF) spoke with  Col. (Ret.) James Waurishuk, an NSC [National Security Council] veteran and former deputy director for intelligence at the U.S. Central Command.  Waurishuk said:   many hands had to be involved throughout the Obama administration to launch such a political spying program  It s unbelievable of [sic] the level and degree of the [Obama] administration to look for information on Donald Trump and his associates, his campaign team and his transition team. This is really, really serious stuff . Michael Doran, former NSC [National Security Council] senior director, told The DCNF Monday that  somebody blew a hole in the wall between national security secrets and partisan politics . This  was a stream of information that was supposed to be hermetically sealed from politics and the Obama administration found a way to blow a hole in that wall , he said. Yes, serious stuff. A felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison.Obama, of course, will have plausible deniability if the Susan Rice scandal blows up into a Watergate. He didn t know. He didn t order the spying. He was playing golf that day. Or any day.And if a Congressional investigation of Rice and her antics reaches a fever pitch, somebody can play the race card. That s always an option. If Rice were white, this never would have happened to her. The Trump people are all over her like white on Rice. Meanwhile, CNN, in alternating segments, can say a) Rice and her people never spied on anybody, and b) everybody spies on everybody all the time, it s not a big deal and then some on-air goofball will add,  In fact, we here at CNN are spying  And the TV screen will go blank, then display colored stripes, then come back and the goofball will be gone, and an anchor will say,  We had a technical problem for a moment.

4010," Trump Says Hillary’s Emails Are Worse Than Watergate, Watergate Prosecutor SHREDS Him","When former President Richard Nixon s cronies broke into DNC Headquarters at the Watergate Hotel in 1972, it was a scandal so monumental and unprecedented that Nixon became the first and only president to resign from the office.The perpetrators were trying to bug the offices and Nixon attempted to cover up the crime using government resources.Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, merely used a personal server to receive and send emails as Secretary of State. While her decision to use a personal server was a bad one, it is hardly a crime and that is what the FBI declared in July when the agency declined to charge her with a crime.Fast-forward to October and Hillary again finds herself in Republican crosshairs as Donald Trump and his deplorable supporters continue to call for her arrest after the FBI reportedly found three emails related to the email investigation on a device belonging to Anthony Weiner.As NBC s Pete Williams reported soon afterward, none of the emails were sent by Clinton or her campaign, nor were these emails hidden by Clinton or her campaign.In fact, the FBI has only just begun investigating the emails and a conclusion won t be reached until after the election and all the signs suggest the FBI will find nothing criminal about these emails either.Yet Donald Trump continues to yammer on to his supporters about how this is an  October surprise  that should derail Hillary s campaign and that her emails are worse than Watergate.Yeah, he totally thinks this situation is worse than the biggest political scandal in American history.But former U.S. Attorney Nick Akerman vehemently disagrees.Akerman was a prosecutor who worked on the Watergate case, so if anyone can compare a scandal to Watergate he s the one to ask.According to a statement provided to Mic, Akerman wrote that FBI Director James Comey acted inappropriately by writing a letter to Congress informing them of the new emails because they haven t even been reviewed yet, which means Comey didn t even bother getting all of the facts before giving Republicans something to whine about only ten days before Election Day.But Akerman saved the real ass-whooping for the Republican nominee and compared him to a past Republican who is just as disgraceful as Nixon. Donald Trump s statement that this is bigger than Watergate is totally absurd,  Akerman wrote.  There is no evidence of any violation of law. For Trump to reach that conclusion based on a total lack of evidence is reminiscent of the innuendo spread by Joseph McCarthy in the early 1950s. #Watergate prosecutor @nickakerman letting both James Comey and Donald Trump have it over today s Hillary Clinton email developments: pic.twitter.com/uWExp4VKyx  Celeste Katz (@CelesteKatzNYC) October 28, 2016That sound you just heard is the sound of all the heads of Trump supporters exploding.Featured Image: Mark Makela/Getty Images",News,"October 29, 2016"

3840, WATCH: This Irish Senator BLASTS His Government For Playing Nice With Fascist Trump,"America will have a fascist in the White House starting on January 20th, and this Irish senator can t believe his own government is accepting that.Despite warnings from experts in the media, historians, and Jews who survived the Holocaust, Americans went to the polls and elected a fascist anyway, disgracing all the soldiers who fought and died during World War II to keep fascism out of America and sweep it out of Europe.After winning, Trump has received congratulation messages from nations around the globe. Some nations have even kissed Trump s ass, which pissed off Irish Senator Aodh n O Riord in to the point where he ripped his government for sucking up to a fascist. America has just elected a fascist and the best thing that the good people in Ireland can do is to ring him up and ask him, is it OK to still bring the shamrock on Saint Patrick s Day? I am embarrassed by the reaction of the Irish government to what has happened in America. I can t believe the reaction from An Taoiseach and from the government. O Riord in then went on a tear listing some of the aspects of fascism. I don t use the term fascist lightly. What else would you call someone who threatens to imprison his political opponents. What else would you call somebody who threatens to not allow people of a certain political faith into their country. What would you say, or what would you call somebody who was threatening to deport 10 million people. He also warned his government that right-wing extremism is rising across Europe and the United States. Can the government not understand what s happening? We are at an ugly international crossroads. What s happening in Britain is appalling. What s happening across Europe is appalling. It has echoes from the 1930s. And America, the most powerful country in the world, has just elected a fascist! He then called for the Minister of Foreign Affairs to explain how Ireland intends to deal with  monster  Trump and said Ireland s support should be conditional like Germany s. Germany and America are connected by values of democracy, freedom and respect for the law and dignity of man,  Angela Merkel said in a message to Trump.  Independent of origin, skin-color, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political views. I offer the next president of the United States close cooperation on the basis of these values. Here s the video via The Irish Independent.Donald Trump and the Republican Party are the enemies of everything that is good in this world.

10134,ICELAND PROUDLY CLAIMS TO HAVE “ERADICATED” Down Syndrome…In Most Gruesome Way Imaginable,"Mainstream news channels rarely draw attention to the negative side of abortion, but CBS News did so this week with a report about Iceland s near 100-percent abortion rate for babies with Down syndrome.  few countries have come as close to eradicating Down syndrome births as Iceland,  the report begins.  Since prenatal screening tests were introduced in Iceland in the early 2000s, the vast majority of women   close to 100 percent   who received a positive test for Down syndrome terminated their pregnancy. Just a handful of children with Down syndrome have been born in Iceland in the past decade. Two are born each year, on average, but the rest are killed in the womb. For most of the children who were born, their mothers decided not to have prenatal screening tests.This deadly discrimination against babies with disabilities is a problem in countries across the world, not just Iceland. In 2014, the Danish government reported 98 percent of unborn babies who tested positive for Down syndrome were aborted. CBS reports the rate in France was 77 percent in 2015, 90 percent in the United Kingdom and 67 percent in the U.S. between 1995 and 2011. Some put the rate even higher in the United States, but it is difficult to determine the exact number because the U.S. government does not keep detailed statistics about abortion.In many of these countries, late-term abortions are legal in cases of fetal anomalies, such as Down syndrome. The UK, for example, prohibits abortions after 24 weeks but allows wide exceptions for late-term abortions involving fetal anomalies.Iceland hospital counselor Helga Sol Olafsdottir does not see any problem with the fact that so many women are having their unborn babies aborted because of Down syndrome. This systematic discrimination is simply a  woman s choice  in her mind.The issue is not gray. It s very clearly wrong, says Penny Nace, president and CEO of Concerned Women for America. This is eugenics and barbarianism at best,  Nace said.  These individuals have no less worth than anyone else. Iceland and many other countries are killing human beings in abortions simply because they have a disability. Down syndrome varies in severity, but most people with the genetic disorder live into their 60s. Some even live on their own, hold down jobs, go to college and get married.For entire story   Life News",politics,"Aug 16, 2017"
6328, Non-Transgender Woman Harassed In Bathroom After Donating Hair To Cancer Patients (VIDEO),"The atmosphere created by conservatives and their anti-transgender witch hunt is becoming more and more apparent by the day. The trend started by North Carolina, with Texas in the process of following suit, is to restrict bathrooms to  gender at birth.  In other words, a transgender woman with double-dee breasts who is wearing a miniskirt would be required to subject herself to harassment by going into the men s room to do her makeup. To most, this is not in any way reasonable. As someone who identifies as a woman, she belongs where she is most comfortable: the women s restroom. But to the uneducated, unwashed religious bigots in our country, she should have to live her life in a constant state of discomfort.But the hysteria has reached a point that even cisgender (biological women who identify as women) must worry about the backlash when one of God s Chosen Imbeciles decides they don t look feminine enough. One such woman is Aimee Toms, who was recently rudely informed that she doesn t belong in the women s restroom. Why?Toms was minding her own business, simply washing her hands at a Walmart in Danbury, Connecticut on Friday when another woman approached her and informed her  You re disgusting!  and  You don t belong here! At the time, Toms was wearing a baseball cap and had very short hair, so she says she can understand why someone might think she is transgender. While her appearance doesn t matter one iota, the reason her hair was short at the time will make the bigot she encountered feel very, very stupid. In a video she posted online, she informed her new hater: Do you know why my hair is so short? In January, I made my third donation to Pantene s Beautiful Lengths Program. Do you know what they do? They take hair donations and they make them into wigs and they give them to cancer patients free of cost. Now, I am damn happy to rock a pixie cut if some kid gets my hair and gets to wear it. And that s worth it to me.You know what isn t worth it? Being discriminated against in a bathroom by some fucking asshole who thinks they have a right to decide what gender I am and that they have a right to judge me for it. After experiencing the discrimination they face firsthand, I cannot fathom the discrimination transgender people must face in a lifetime,  she says.  Can you imagine going out every day and having people tell you you should not be who you are or that people will not accept you as who you are? At this point, the hate is getting ridiculous. Most people have used a restroom with someone who is transgender at some point in their lives without noticing. If daytime talk shows are any indicator, there is a hefty supply of men who have had sexual relations with a woman who happens to have a penis   and they didn t give a flying f*ck at the time. People are people. Transgender people are people who happen to have been born into the  wrong body,  so to speak. There is no harm in a society allowing people to simply be who they are without fear of reprisals. Unfortunately, the American Right disagrees because reasons.Watch Toms lay the smackdown on the haters below:https://www.facebook.com/never.shout.aimee/videos/vb.1473214698/10206543775341127/?type=3&theaterFeatured image via Newstimes",News,"May 16, 2016"
6729, WATCH: River Set On Fire Thanks To Fracking,"Thanks to the quest for natural gas power through fracking, an Australian river has become polluted enough that it can be set on fire. Dramatic video of what happened was captured by activists and published online:https://www.facebook.com/RTvids/videos/1201457439864507/A Queensland river near a fracking site exploded into flames after a coal seam gas (CSG) protester sparked a kitchen lighter above the water surface.Greens MP Jeremy Buckingham uploaded dramatic footage of the river ablaze to his website and social media accounts to highlight his party s concerns about fracking and the extraction of coal seam gas.The video shows the New South Wales Greens MP ignite the fire on the Condamine river and then jump up in shock, exclaiming:  Holy f***! Unbelievable   a river on fire! The video echoes other viral videos in the past that have shown that the gases released by fracking have sometimes leaked into the traditional water supply, and allowed similar experiments where water coming into homes has been set on fire as well.Fracking has also been linked to increased earthquake activity, and as a result it has been banned in several U.S. states, sometimes completely or pending further study of the technology.Some have called for a complete ban on the practice, while others have called for a slowdown in its use. Fracking has been credited with contributing to the lower price of oil and gas in the last few years, but like every other energy extraction technology used on a mass scale, it has an environmental downside.The only energy technologies without the serious problems of fracking or traditional oil drilling are green technologies like solar or wind power, but to date they are incapable of generating the kind of power output needed to fully displace the traditional sources of energy. The Obama administration has tried to incentivize the creation of  green tech,  but has been opposed by Republicans who take in the bulk of donations from the fossil fuel industry (who also fund an enormous amount of anti-green propaganda).Featured image via Facebook",News,"April 24, 2016"
6003, The Obamas Gave A Heartbreaking Tribute To Muhammad Ali (VIDEO),"The last couple of years have been rampant with what seems like premature deaths. Would we have ever been able to prepare ourselves for the deaths of Robin Williams, David Bowie, Prince and so many, many more people? Unfortunately, we have another name to add to what seems like a particularly grim year: Muhammad Ali   and the Obamas, in a statement to America,  mourned the loss as deeply as any of us.To the Obamas, Ali   who was resoundingly loved and admired, and was actually (unlike President Obama) a black Muslim   was  The Greatest. Period. Like everyone else on the planet, Michelle and I mourn his passing. But we re also grateful to God for how fortunate we are to have known him, if just for a while; for how fortunate we all are that The Greatest chose to grace our time, Muhammad Ali was The Greatest. Period. If you just asked him, he d tell you. He d tell you he was the double greatest; that he d  handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder into jail,  Obama wrote.  But what made The Champ the greatest   what truly separated him from everyone else   is that everyone else would tell you pretty much the same thing. The President also tweeted, showing himself working with a picture of the Champ behind him.He shook up the world, and the world s better for it. Rest in peace, Champ. pic.twitter.com/z1yM3sSLH3  President Obama (@POTUS) June 4, 2016Obama also noted that he has a pair of Ali s boxing gloves in his private study.Obama continued,  I am America,  he once declared.  I am the part you won t recognize. But get used to me   black, confident, cocky; my name, not yours; my religion, not yours; my goals, my own. Get used to me.  That s the Ali I came to know as I came of age   not just as skilled a poet on the mic as he was a fighter in the ring, but a man who fought for what was right. A man who fought for us. He stood with King and Mandela; stood up when it was hard; spoke out when others wouldn t. His fight outside the ring would cost him his title and his public standing. It would earn him enemies on the left and the right, make him reviled, and nearly send him to jail. But Ali stood his ground. And his victory helped us get used to the America we recognize today. Muhammad Ali shook up the world,  Obama concluded in his tribute to Ali.  And the world is better for it. We are all better for it. Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to his family, and we pray that the greatest fighter of them all finally rests in peace. Source: Rolling StoneHere s a video:While Obama was born during the height of the Civil Rights Movement, he came of age watching Ali. To Obama, Martin Luther King and even Malcolm X were parts of history books, but Ali was brash, confident, smart, socially aware and a force to be reckoned with in the 60s and 70s. While so many Civil Rights leaders were working behind the scenes, or perhaps in front, but more quietly, Ali told the world that he could do anything, no matter his skin color. Perhaps there would have never been a President Barack Obama if it weren t for the example put forth by Muhammad Ali.Featured image via Kent Gavin at Getty Images.",News,"June 5, 2016"
21790,CLINTON CHARITIES RAKED IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS IN THE MILLIONS,"This is like one big slush fund for Hillary 2016. The Clintons not only collected millions from foreign donors, they also rake in $7 million in taxpayer dollars. Really outrageous! The Clinton Foundation and its major health charity have raked in more than $7 million from the U.S. government in recent years, according to an analysis of public records conducted by the Washington Free Beacon.The Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), chaired by Bill Clinton and run by the former president s long-time associate Ira Magaziner, has received $6,010,898 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) since 2010. CHAI, the biggest arm of the Clinton family s charitable efforts, accounting for 60 percent of all spending, received $3,193,500 in fiscal years 2010, 2011, and 2012, according to federal contracts, during Hillary Clinton s tenure as secretary of state. The organization received an additional $2,817,398 from the CDC in FYs 2013, 2014, and 2015.The grants, including $200,000 awarded as recently as January, have gone to CHAI s Global AIDS program, and are filed under  Global Health and Child Survival.  The CDC is listed as a $1 to $10 million contributor to CHAI, according to its donor list released earlier this month.The Boston-based health arm of the Clinton Foundation has come under scrutiny for failing to disclose donations from foreign governments in violation of a pledge Clinton made to the Obama administration before she assumed office as secretary of state.A Reuters report found that the health initiative stopped making its annual disclosure in 2010 and that  no complete list of donors to the Clintons  charities has been published  since. The group only recently published a partial donor list, which its spokesperson Maura Daley told Reuters  made up for  CHAI s  oversight  of failing to meet the disclosure agreement.When asked whether the CDC has any concern regarding its funding of CHAI or plans to provide grants to the organization in the future, an agency spokesperson told the Washington Free Beacon that it  can t predict who will apply for and be awarded grants. CDC and potential grantees must follow federal guidelines when applying for or awarding and monitoring grants,  said Shelly Diaz.  CHAI, like any other organization meeting federal requirements, may apply for CDC grants. They would also be expected to meet the same ongoing requirements for grantees (e.g. reports, audits, performance standards). CHAI received hundreds of millions from foreign nations between 2009 and 2014, including: the United Kingdom ($79.7 million), Australia ($58.6 million), Norway ($38.1 million), Canada ($12.1 million), Ireland ($11.7 million), Sweden ($7.2 million), and New Zealand ($1.2 million).The Boston Globe found that foreign donations  sharply accelerated  to CHAI when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state.Read more: WFB",left-news,"May 1, 2015"
8517, Trevor Noah Roasts Jeb Bush’s Pathetically Desperate Effort To Remain A Viable Candidate (VIDEO),"If Jeb Bush watched The Daily Show last night, he should finally throw in the towel before he embarrasses himself and his family even more than he has already.On Monday night, Trevor Noah torched George W. Bush s brother in a hilarious segment that began with Noah referring to Jeb as the most desperate candidate in the presidential field. He s so desperate, he s even released his own fragrance for men,  Noah quipped. Dubbed  Desperation by Jeb!,  Noah promoted the scent as being  for when being yourself just isn t enough.  He then took a whiff and laughingly remarked,  Smells like George Bush. But it got even worse for Jeb from there.Noah reported that Bush and his supporters have spent more money on ads than anyone else, but that for all of the $40 million spent on positive ads telling voters about Bush, it has resulted in zero returns.This is a private admission from advisers to Jeb s own SuperPAC, Right To Rise. Even a Bush supporter was embarrassed by the results, exclaiming that,  You might as well light all of this money on fire. An amused Noah pointed out that it s pretty messed up when your campaign spending is failing so bad that burning the money would have been just as useful. That would have been more effective for Jeb Bush because at least people would have gathered around him for the warmth of the fire. People notice a fire. They don t notice Jeb Bush. The money could have been put to better use by building a new water system for Flint, Michigan, Noah added.Instead, Bush spent a lot of the money on video mailers featuring a Bush documentary that were actually mailed to his supporters and potential voters, something that Noah found to be such a huge waste of money that he was rendered speechless for a few seconds before regaining his composure to nail Jeb with another zinger. Poor Jeb, he s so desperate for his videos to go viral he s willing to physically mail them to your house. Still, Jeb Bush hadn t reached the bottom of the desperation pot.Noah then revealed that Bush had enlisted his mother to appear in an ad touting him as the one candidate who  seems  to be able to solve the country s problems. The Daily Show host noted that Jeb s own mom didn t sound sold on her son s qualifications as presidential material. It s like a guy getting his mom to hit people up on Tinder for him,  he said, which led to a video clip showing an exchange between Bush and a voter. Bush asked the voter who she is voting for. After she replied that she  didn t know yet,  Bush responded,  Oh, come on. And thus a new campaign slogan was born.Here s the video via Comedy Central.Seriously, Jeb.

1765, ‘Lunch Shaming’: Schools Punish Poor Kids Who Can’t Pay For Lunch With Appalling Humiliation (VIDEO),"As we all know, there are many children in America who cannot afford school lunch. Some of these kids are  lucky  (and I use the term loosely) to qualify for free or reduced price school lunches. Others are not. To qualify for these government-sanctioned programs, the children have to be from a family whose income is no more than 30% above the poverty line. That means that a family of four can make no more than $32,000 a year to qualify. Any adult living in America today understands that this is a very difficult   in fact, damn near impossible   amount of money to live on. So, this leads to many children around the country going through the lunch line at school with the inability to pay. However, the tactics used to solve this issue are downright appalling, and they are being deployed all over the nation.A practice referred to as  lunch shaming  is being used to humiliate poor children around the nation for their inability to pay for their lunches. Some kids are stamped in the lunch line with stamps that say things like,  I need lunch money.  Others are forced to clean tables in the cafeteria in front of other students. Still others even have their hot lunches thrown out for their inability to pay.All this serves to do is humiliate already struggling children for things that are far beyond their control. Further, in the cases where the lunches are thrown out, the kids are forced to go hungry. Even worse, some of these kids only get fed at school, so that means that they are literally starving when their one source of food is denied to them.This kind of thing has lifelong effects. Luckily, New Mexico has become the first state to try to put a stop to the practice of lunch shaming. They have introduced legislation that would outlaw the practice, and would make it illegal to engage in any conversations regarding a student s ability to pay for lunch at school with anyone but the student s parents or guardians.The entire nation needs to follow in New Mexico s footsteps. The fact that this sort of thing is happening in the United States of America at all is disgraceful. We should all be ashamed.Watch the video report on this practice below, via AJ+ on Twitter:Children are being shamed for not having lunch money across the U.S. pic.twitter.com/4uSyIJYIGI  AJ+ (@ajplus) April 17, 2017Featured image via video screen capture",News,"April 17, 2017"

[Video],"IT S INTERESTING THAT A LIGHTHEARTED MOMENT LIKE THE ONE BELOW COULD CAUSE SUCH ANGER AND OUTRAGE FROM THE LEFT!Rob Gronkowksi popped into today s White House press briefing to ask Sean Spicer if he needed any help. Spicer, a Patriots fan, declined the offer. Mild laughs were had. Gronkowski then disappeared, presumably to cause more mischief in other parts of the building.It s not surprising that the tight end performed a bit like this. That he was wearing a shirt while doing it was a bit of a shock.Right after this video was posted Facebook comments were brutal about how unprofessional it was to have this guy pop into the briefing. We had Obama s antics for 8 years and these people can t take one light moment like this?The left went nuts with faux outrage: We can think of many moments during the Obama administration where some  unprofessional  antics took place. The only problem is that these  antics  are much more serious Remember Jay Carney? Well, here are 6 big moments he s caught in BIG lies. We consider this to be much more important than what happened today.6 OF THE TOP  ANTICS  FROM WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFINGS UNDER OBAMA   JAY CARNEY S NOT FUNNY BUT SERIOUS  GAFFES : 1. When he said he knows 3 people named  Hilary Rosen.  After Obama adviser Hilary Rosen said Ann Romney hadn t worked a day in her life, it was discovered Rosen had visited the White House numerous times. When questioned on it, Carney claimed he knew 3 separate women named  Hilary Rosen. 2. That one time he stumbled when asked why the Obama Administration withheld a crucial Benghazi email.3. That day when he called a reporter s repeated questions on Kathleen Sebelius  lame. 4. That time he admitted White House staff knew of the IRS scandal and didn t tell Obama.5. That time he admitted that the Obama Budget wouldn t balance.6. That moment when he finally admitted Obama s  Keep Your Plan  promise wasn t true.Shouldn t the liberal snowflakes be outraged at what Jay Carney did? ",politics,"Apr 19, 2017"
6120, Bernie Sanders Lets Chuck Todd Know If He’s Willing To Be Vice President (VIDEO),"With the Democratic primary process drawing to a close soon, and Hillary Clinton likely obtaining the required delegates needed to secure the nomination after June 7, it leaves the question open as to whether or not Bernie Sanders would be open to being vice president.So, while appearing on Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd pressed Sanders on that very issue. Todd asked: Would you take the call if Hillary Clinton asked you to be her running mate? Sanders replied: Right now, again, here we are in California, I m knocking my brains out to win the Democratic nomination. That s where I am right now. What happens afterwards, you know, we ll see. But right now, my focus is on winning the nomination. It s that  we ll see  that has everyone talking. It shows that he definitely seems to be entertaining the idea. However, it s completely understandable that he wouldn t want to definitively say  yes,  or  no  for that matter, as the primary contests are still not over, and Sanders, as well as his supporters, would like to see how things turn out first.Would a Clinton/Sanders ticket unite the party that seems to be divided at the moment? Very likely so, but that doesn t mean it would be something that should happen. However, no matter what, whoever doesn t get the nomination should find it their new purpose to make sure Donald Trump stays out of the White House. Because a Trump win wouldn t only be devastating for the nation, but the entire world. Watch the segment here: Featured image via video screen capture",News,"May 29, 2016"

22684,Oregon Governor Says Feds ‘Must Act’ Against Protesters and Armed Groups in Burns,"21st Century Wire says So far, after nearly 20 days of protests near Burns, Oregon, there s been no one hurt or injured, but it seems the state s chief executive is keen to change that result.According to reports today, Oregon Governor Kate Brown told a news conference hat federal officials,  must move quickly to end the occupation and hold all of the wrongdoers accountable. The governor does not appear at all concerned with the Hammond family s plight, nor with any of this story s core issues like legal minimum sentencing, jury nullification, or private, state and federal land rights   and yet, seems to want an armed confrontation in her state   and not with any of her own state or county law enforcement agents, but by using federal agents instead. PLEADING TO FEDS: Oregon governor Kate Brown.She added,  Residents of Harney County have been overlooked and underserved by federal officials  response thus far. I have conveyed these very grave concerns directly to our leaders at the highest levels of our government: the U.S. Department of Justice and the White House. The Democratic governor also claims that the protest has cost the state over $500,000 over the last 3 weeks.  We ll be asking federal officials to reimburse the state for these costs. It s not clear exactly how she arrived at that figure, but it can t be from calculating Harney County sheriff s deputies overtime pay.Harney County Judge Steve Grasty also voice a desire to see federal agents take a more aggressive approach towards Ammon Bundy and his fellow protesters, saying,  I hope they lock it down. People shouldn t be coming and going. Maybe it s time. READ MORE HAMMOND NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Hammond Ranch",US_News,"January 21, 2016"
22047,Mid Summer Anger: Oliver Stone Waxes US Establishment’s Russia Conspiracy Theory,"EDITOR S NOTE: We recognize the following eloquent rant posted on Oliver Stone s Facebook page as being of high integrity and congenial to boot. America, and the world, will continue to find itself in peril so long as this sort of measured, thoughtful analysis remains in such short supply in Washington DC. Wake up America, you are now asleep at the wheel. . By Oliver StoneCongress passed its beloved Russia sanctions last week by a vote of 419-3! The Senate followed with a vote of 98-2!! I guess  American Exceptionalism  includes the vast stupidity inherent in having two giant oceans to distance us from the rest of humanity.With all the Apples and Microsofts and computer geniuses we have in our country, can we not even accept the possibility that perhaps our intelligence agencies are not doing their job, and maybe, just maybe, are deliberately misleading us to continue their false-flag war against Russia? Or for that matter, that Russia itself may not be that invested in screwing up our vaunted democracy with such sloppy malware as claimed? Especially in view of the strong statement put out by Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity, a group of reform-minded veterans throwing a dose of acid on the infamous  Brennan-Clapper Report  of January 6, 2017. With this report alone (see below), much less the overt lying and leaking that s been going on, both James Clapper ( We don t do surveillance on our own citizens ) and John Brennan ( Drones and torture? None of our business ) should be investigated as thoroughly as Michael Flynn, Jared Kushner, Trump s son, etc.What s happened to Elizabeth Warren, Barbara Lee, or any of the people who ve displayed some independent thinking in the past? Have they actually read this report? Somebody out there in DC, please explain to me this omission of common sense. Are the Washington Post and the New York Times so powerful that no one bothers to read or think beyond them? It seems the TV stations in this country take their copy from them.I accept the US decline. That s a given   after all, compare our broken-down New York subway system with Moscow s, as well as many other cities  pristine and impeccable services. These sanctions, which I pray Europe can independently judge and discard, are as dumb as giving out medals to Generals who keep losing wars. I still have this image burned in my brain of Petraeus with his 11/12(?) rows of ribbons, many looking like Boy Scout badges, surrounded by adoring Congressmen as he lied his way through his foreign policy testimony.Never mind that any moment now a Dr. Strangelove-type incident can occur   with less reaction time, say 15 minutes, compared to the 1960s 2/3 hours. We are truly at the edge as Mr. P pointed out in the documentary I made. Such Roman arrogance, such blindness, calls out for another Vietnam, another Iraq. We re screaming for some Karmic Boot up the ass. Destroying our pride would be a favor that the gods could do us.I can go on   but I m angry as you can tell. So what s the point of going to the windows and screaming, even if I were on television? Read the report below from Sanity Inc. and pray another August (1914) passes without the war Congress, Media, and the Military-Industrial Complex are literally dying for.I now fully realize how World War I started.

5371," Elizabeth Warren Calls Trump A ‘Two-Bit Dictator,’ Slams His RNC Speech","America got i s first true glimpse of a Trump presidency on the final night of the RNC. Instead of a speech focused on the economy and bringing back jobs to the United States, the charade delivered by the Republican presidential candidate was filled with hate and fear, resembling an almost Nixon-esque rhetoric not seen in almost fifty years.The nation needs to wake up. Luckily, we have Elizabeth Warren to help us do that.While appearing on CBS  Late Night with Stephen Colbert immediately following Trump s speech, Warren (who has been rumored as a potential VP choice for Hillary Clinton), slammed the Republican candidate for sounding like a  two-bit dictator  and chided him for his divisive rhetoric: What Donald Trump says is there s a problem out there and what you have to understand is that it s all about each other. What you need to be afraid of is every other American. I ve got to tell you, that speech tonight, he sounded like some two-bit dictator of some country that you couldn t find on a map. Through the applause and a hilarious  defense  of Trump from Colbert, Warren doubled down: He sounded like a dictator of a small country rather than a man who is running for the highest office of the strongest democracy on the face of the earth. That s what he sounded like. And just like that, Elizabeth Warren summed up exactly how we all feel. To put it plainly, as Warren did,  Donald Trump is a bad guy. Elizabeth Warren has been a special thorn in Donald Trump s side. No one, not the media or even Hillary Clinton, has gotten under Trump s skin more than she has. An attack dog in her own right, Warren has been absolutely spot on in her criticism of the potential fascist-in-chief: he s a thin skinned, dictating fraud.We learned earlier this week that Trump has no plan to actually take on the domestic or foreign roles needed to make a great president. That s what Mike Pence will be for.Hopefully Warren will reiterate her observations come the Democratic National Convention, where substance (not just venom) will be front and center for the whole country, and indeed the whole world, to see.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"July 22, 2016"
18728,NBC CORRESPONDENT Tells Panel Of Extremely BIASED Journalists: “Journalists Aren’t Biased”…Goes On To Totally Trash President Trump With Other BIASED News Hosts [VIDEO],"Watch as Katy Tur tries to hilariously convince the audience that the press doesn t have any biases:  If we have any bias, it s a bias towards the facts . She then goes on to convince the audience what a horrible human being Donald Trump is,  He didn t appeal to their better demons of voters in this country. He appealed to their most base fears and their most base frustrations and anger and that worked for him. Watch:During a news conference in July of 2016, NBC News correspondent Katy Tur asked Trump whether he has  any qualms about asking a foreign government   to hack into a system of anybody s in this country  after Trump said he hoped Russia would find more emails from Hillary Clinton or the DNC. Hey, you know what gives me more pause, that a person in our government, crooked Hillary Clinton   here s what gives me more pause,  Trump said, as Tur tried to ask follow-ups.  Be quiet, I know you want to, you know, save her. That a person in our government, Katy, would delete or get rid of 33,000 emails. That gives me a big problem. After she gets a subpoena. She gets subpoenaed, and she gets rid of 33,000 emails. That gives me a problem. Now, if Russia or China or any other country has those emails, I mean to be honest with you, I d love to see them. As Tur asked another question a few minutes later, mentioning Trump s poll numbers, Trump once again mocked her. Katy just said that, many polls show you are winning. Are you Katy Tur of NBC? It s a disguise,  he said.This is far from the first time Trump has picked on Tur. In June, Trump told  Fox & Friends  that his campaign  don t even let her in  or let people talk to her  because she s not a very good reporter. In December, Trump called out Tur in the middle of a rally, leading Trump supporters to point at her and boo.

13691,SYRIAN IMMIGRANT Who Said “9-11 Changed The World For Good”…Calls Syria Her “Homeland” Is Homeland Security Advisor,"Feeling safer? One of the sitting members on the Homeland Security Advisory Council s (HSAC) Subcommittee on Countering Violent Extremism is a 25-year-old immigrant of Syrian heritage who said that the 9/11 attacks  changed the world for good  and has consistently disparaged America, free speech and white people on social media.Laila Alawa was one of just 15 people tapped to serve on the newly-formed HSAC Subcommittee on Countering Violent Extremism in 2015   the same year she became an American citizen. Just last week, the subcommittee submitted a report to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, recommending that the DHS avoid using Muslim terminology like the words  sharia  and  jihad  when discussing terrorism.Alawa says she immigrated into the U.S. when she was ten years old. Her family had already left Syria by the time she was born.  But I will always be Syrian. I will always be from Syria. I will always be of Syria,  she wrote in November 2015, calling the country her  homeland. In 2014, Alawa commemorated the September 11 attacks by tweeting that  9/11 changed the world for good, and there s no other way to say it. Exactly a year later, she claimed that, after September 11,  Being American meant you were white. In April 2013, she responded to a tweet from activist Pamela Geller who called the Boston Marathon bombings  jihad  by tweeting:  go fuck yourself. On September 21   the day after Secretary of State John Kerry announced that the U.S. would accept 85,000 Syrian refugees in 2016 and 100,000 more in 2017   Alawa mocked the  Salty white tears all over my newsfeed. In the Countering Violent Extremism report published last week, Alawa and her fellow subcommittee members recommended that the Department of Homeland Security  adapt to the changing nature of violent extremism itself  by devoting more attention to  anarchists, sovereign citizens, white-supremacists, and others. The report also recommended that, in order to combat violent extremism, the DHS  Focus on gender diversity of youth through careful attention to the range of push and pull factors that attract individuals of differing gender. As originally reported by The Daily Caller, the subcommittee Alawa serves on instructed the DHS to begin  using American English instead of religious, legal and cultural terms like  jihad,   sharia,   takfir  or  umma  when discussing terrorism in order to avoid offending Muslims.Two months before Secretary Johnson created the Subcommittee on Combatting Violent Extremism, Alawa tweeted:  THE US HAS NEVER BEEN A UTOPIA UNLESS YOU WERE A STRAIGHT WHITE MALE THAT OWNED LAND. straight up period go home shut up.

423, Trump Humiliated As DACA Decision Practically Kills His Presidency (DETAILS),"As we saw with his Muslim travel ban as well as his attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare, every time Donald Trump puts forth one of his disastrous ideas, it blows up in his face and delivers a devastating blow to his already failing presidency.Each time Trump introduces an unpopular policy or idea, his already historically low approval rating takes another nosedive. This week, Trump only managed to make things worse for himself when he decided to end former President Obama s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program. Here s the problem   most Americans disagree with him.According to a recent survey from Morning Consult/Politico, almost 80% (76% to be exact) of Americans do not believe that Dreamers (the undocumented immigrants that were brought into the United States illegally as kids) should be forced to return to their countries. The majority of Americans are far more humane than Trump, and believe that these immigrants should have the opportunity to become citizens, as most have been productive members and have contributed greatly to American society.Trump is especially in trouble because his decision to end DACA only offers more proof that he is a racist a**hole. As MSNBC s Joy Reid perfectly pointed out, there is  no economic, national security or social cohesion rationale  for ending DACA: Trump might say that he has  great love  for the immigrants that are living in America, but his decision proves the exact opposite. Trump wants to strip Dreamers of the lives and progress they have made for themselves in this country and force them to return to countries they are unfamiliar with, where they will have nothing.With this decision, Trump is not only screwing himself over by killing his presidency, but he is also basically putting the GOP in great danger in future elections by excluding one of the fastest-growing voting demographics. Trump is sinking the Republican Party   and his presidency   at record speed.Featured image via video screen capture ",News,"September 6, 2017"

447, Trump Trolls Turn On GOP Moderates: ‘You’re Gonna Get Primaried’,"Believe or not,  moderates  do exist in the Republican Party. To those of us on the left, they hardly seem moderate, but they certainly aren t like, say, the Ted Cruz s of the world. In the House of Representatives, they even have a name. They call themselves the Tuesday Group. And since Donald Trump took office, it has been Republicans from that group who have been pushing back the hardest on Trump s more extreme and cruel policies. To that end, it should come as no surprise that Trump s band of trolls in his base are threatening the people in the Tuesday Group with primary challenges in 2018.At the top of the Trump trolls  list of targets is Tuesday Group co-chair Charlie Dent (R-PA). They re letting Rep. Dent know that his days are numbered in the most public of ways   by holding a huge event where they blasted their warnings to him from a park in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Adam Gingrich, who gives political advice to hard right politicians said to Dent: You re gonna get primaried. This particular rally is just the beginning. These people seem to be ready to primary anyone who has been critical of Trump and his agenda from the right. There s just one problem with that, though: They don t seem to understand some of these districts. In a place like Pennsylvania, Ted Cruz-style policies will not fly. These people have to be more moderate than say, members of the ultra conservative Freedom Caucus or they don t get elected and re-elected. There s that, and the fact that most of them seem to at least be attempting to appear reasonable. Despite these facts, though, word has leaked out that Trump himself went after Rep. Dent in a private rant, saying that Dent is destroying the Republican Party. So, as they are likely to do, the Trump Trolls came out in force on Friday in order to back their orange man up. Northampton County GOP Chairwoman Gloria  Lee  Snover said of Rep. Dent: I looked Charlie Dent in the eye and I saw the swamp. In times past, I ve supported Charlie Dent as the only alternative. But now, with his disregard and disrespect to my president   I will no longer be able to support Congressman Dent. For the first time, we finally are going to have primary challengers we can get behind. So, in other words, fall in lockstep with Trump or get out. Rep. Dent, to his credit, is pushing back, though. He says of the situation: I have repeatedly made it clear that on issues such as reforming the VA, making the regulatory environment more reasonable, improving America s infrastructure, providing necessary funding to help meet the needs of our military and spurring economic growth, I will work constructively and supportively with President Trump. At the same time. I am not a sycophant. If the president errs on issues that are important to the people of the 15th, or for the entire country, I will continue to state my opinions respectfully and civilly. The best part of this is that it could be a huge gift to Democrats. Pennsylvania is a swing state that, until 2016, always went blue. Therefore, the idea of a hard right conservative being elected there is pretty out there. We can t rule it out, of course, but if the GOP spends all of its times fighting with itself and the Democrats unify around one candidate, we win.Get it together, Democrats. Here are a whole bunch of seats we could possibly win simply because Trump Trolls can t abide a GOP lawmaker who isn t licking Trump s boots 24/7.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"September 2, 2017"

Pretty sure that s it, and keeping true to form, they re playing directly to their number one demographic by talking about  pride. Of course, they infer that it s  American pride,  but when you listen to Sean Hannity speak, he tells the tale of a life that was granted to him, and not so much for others.Hannity talks about how he s worked since he was eight years old. From being a paperboy, to working in a restaurant, to working in construction, to finally being able to pursue his dreams in broadcasting. To be honest, the first thing I thought of while watching this promo was  how nice for a white man in America to so easily be able to pursue his dreams,  and then the word  pride  flashed up on the video.Hannity loves saying  only in America.  Yes, here in America where we still have systemic racism that prevents others from pursuing those same dreams that he had. But will he see it that way? No, of course not. Does he mean it that way? Probably not, because he s too blind to his privilege. However, going on and on about how he was granted opportunities that were granted to him primarily because he won the genetic lottery, is that really something to be  proud  about? To him, apparently it is.This video might as well have read  white pride  at the end.Watch for yourself: And then, I have an opportunity to pursue a dream only in America.    @SeanHannity #ProudAmericanhttps://t.co/GaxjX4oWeE  Fox News (@FoxNews) July 2, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"July 2, 2016"
8870, Watch What Happens When a Muslim Woman Shows Up At A Donald Trump Rally (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has managed to attract the most racist and Islamophobic of American voters. That was all on display in Rock Hill, South Carolina, at a Friday night campaign rally when a Muslim woman, 56-year-old Rose Hamid, was thrown out by Trump security.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK0Otof0wow]Rose, dressed in traditional Islamic dress and a t-shirt that read  I come in Peace,  was sitting in the stands directly behind Trump when Trump supporters, at the urging of his campaign staff, began to chant Trump s name after Rose stood up when Trump suggested that Syrian refugees were affiliated with ISIS. Rose simply stood up and stayed silent when she began to be heckled, which eventually led to her removal by Trump s security.Hamid later said that she  came to the rally to let Trump supporters see what a Muslim looks like so I figured that I d give them the opportunity to meet one. She said that many were shouting  epithets  at her. She said that one man yelled,  You have a bomb, you have a bomb. Trump made an ironic comment at her, making the victim of the night the victimizer. Trump said: There is hatred against us that is unbelievable. It s their hatred, it s not our hatred. Major Steven Thompson of the Rock Hill Police Department said that Hamid was removed  from the rally because the campaign advised him before the event that  anybody who made any kind of disturbance  should be immediately ejected.However, it s clear from the video that Hamid was not making a disturbance. It s become commonplace for Trump supporters to remove and sometimes beat individuals who challenge his stance on racist and anti-Islamic dogma which has attracted followers from across the country.This is Trump s America, and as can clearly be seen from the video, if this person gets to power, we are all in trouble.Featured image via YouTube Screenshot.",News,"January 9, 2016"
10056,PELOSI JUST FLUNKED CONSTITUTIONAL LAW: ‘You Can’t Cry Wolf in a Crowded Theater’ [Video],"Nancy Pelosi just flunked Constitutional Law! Pelosi repeated her request that the National Park Service deny a permit to an alleged  alt-right demonstration  called Patriot Prayer. Pelosi said  not allow these elements to use a national park to spew forth their venom.  She then said that  protecting people  was the Park Service s  first responsibility. This is a trend of the left lately they claim stopping free speech, protests and removing statues have become  homeland security  issues. Jeh Johnson just commented this week that we must remove statues because they ve become a  homeland security  issue. See where this is going? The left claims to be for free speech but in reality they aren t for anyone on the opposing side speaking out. This is getting into dangerous territory but not because of what the right is doing IronicJEH JOHNSON SUDDENLY THINKS CONFEDERATE STATUES ARE A THREAT TO HOMELAND SECURITY: This is rich! The guy who opened our borders to criminals during the Obama era is now telling us that statues are a homeland security threat?  Former Obama administration official Jeh Johnson said on This Week with Martha Raditz that the removal of Confederate statues was a matter of  public safety and homeland security  on Sunday Oh brother!According to David French of National Review:Where to begin? First, It s flat-out unconstitutional for the park service to deny a permit to any group simply because public officials deem the group s speech venomous. Even if their speech is truly vile, they have the same right of access to the park as any other expressive organization.Second, while we want law enforcement to protect people, it is also required to protect liberty. Any police force that maintains security without also protecting liberty has failed in its core constitutional function.Third, the quote is wrong. She s obviously referring to Oliver Wendell Holmes s famous statement in Schenck v. United States that  The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic.  Fire. Wolf. Whatever. It s not important compared to the next point below.Fourth, anyone who quotes Schenck is quoting bad law. In fact, it s one of the most  odious free speech decisions in the Court s history.

4702, WATCH This GOP Rep. Angrily Offer A Gift To His Fellow Republicans For Rejecting Zika Funding,"The only time Republicans want to actually help people is when it will help them, too. Rep. David Jolly (R-FL) is well aware of this, and being from Florida, he s understandably angry about the House s refusal to pass funding to combat Zika. So he decided to try and make his obstructive, intransigent colleagues understand the crisis   by threatening to release 100 mosquitoes from Florida onto the House floor.He also berated them for their utter selfishness: I brought these mosquitoes today to convey that fear and that anxiety of millions of Americans, of Floridians. Can you imagine the fear and anxiety in this chamber if these mosquitoes were outside this jar, not inside this jar.Members of Congress would run down the hall to the physician s office to be tested. They would spray themselves before coming down here. This is the fear of Floridians! Right here! The House is interested in defunding Planned Parenthood to the point where they stick that legislation in everything, hoping that putting it in an otherwise must-pass bill will lead to getting rid of the organization altogether. They do this even when doing so is totally irrelevant, and actually damaging, to the very real problems Americans face.Like Zika, in Florida. Watch him go at the rest of the House below:Democrats actually blocked the bill, but they did so because of provisions on Planned Parenthood, the fact that it would rob the ACA of needed funding, and the fact that it was nearly $1 billion less than the Obama administration had requested. Furthermore, the Senate passed a bi-partisan Zika bill of its own that the House wouldn t vote on. Republicans love to play this game so they can blame Democrats for obstruction.The truth is, if they d just pass a clean bill like grown-ups, then we d have a lot more governing and a lot less of this.In fact, Paul Ryan said that when it came time for House and Senate negotiators to act, it was Democrats who refused. He left out one teensy, tiny little detail when he blasted them about it   the fact that Republican negotiators insisted the bill must carry a provision blocking funding for a Planned Parenthood affiliate in Puerto Rico.Since January, Zika has spread to 13 states, likely exists in far more, and is at crisis levels in Florida. 84 pregnant women have been diagnosed with the virus, and there are probably hundreds more who are currently undiagnosed. As of just a few days ago, there were 614 known cases total in Florida. There were 210 known cases in California.With this, one would hope that Republicans could put their politics aside and pass a clean bill to address the crisis, and then go back to playing politics if they must. Vice President Biden actually went straight to Congress to ask them to stop playing games. From Reuters: Give us an up-or-down vote, straight, on Zika,  Biden said at an event on Capitol Hill with fellow Democrats from the Senate and House of Representatives. I understand attaching controversial issues to important legislation   but this is a national emergency,  Biden added.  People s health, the well-being of unborn children, the health of the country at large, is at stake. Act.

He decided to try and instill the fear that his state feels over the virus. It s unclear if the gambit worked, though.

5391, The Trump Family’s Expressions During Ted Cruz’s RNC Speech Are Priceless,"Make no mistake about it: Ted Cruz is horrible. But you ve got to admire his ability to stick to his convictions. His terrible, terrible convictions. Ted Cruz is a lot of things   a raging homophobe, a Christofascist, a man who thinks it is his right to tell women what to do with their bodies because of something he read in a book written by people who had no f*cking clue where the sun goes at night, a greasy pervert who spent his college days creeping around the girls  dorm in a bathrobe, and a man whose family seems as disgusted by him as the rest of us are   but he s no coward.On Wednesday, Cruz marched right up to the stage and astonished Republicans by doing something previously unheard-of: breaking free, ever so slightly, of the hive mind that seems to have absorbed the Right over time. He didn t do it for any respectable reasons, of course. He just believes so strongly that God wants him to be President that it would completely destroy him to endorse Hitler Trump.Cruz spouted the familiar rhetoric we have heard from the seemingly endless line of right-wing automatons that have vomited up verbal dysentery for what feels like an eternity to those of us here at Addicting Info, but one thing was missing that we had heard from the rest: an endorsement. Sure, Cruz went so far as to endorse Donald Trump s ridiculous wall, but he stopped short of throwing his full weight behind The Donald, encouraging conservatives to vote their conscience.These words caused the vapid, paint fume-huffing Republican base to erupt in a chorus of boos as they demonstrated once and for all that they don t have, or don t care to acknowledge, their respective consciences.Trump crowd turning on Cruz pic.twitter.com/BCjUp2Aiv4  Graham Moomaw (@gmoomaw) July 21, 2016Yes, this was a terrible scene   almost something out of Black Mirror. But this dreadfully surreal moment did offer one small glimmer of happiness to distract from the rather depressing image of thousands of Republicans booing the idea of having a conscience: the look on the Trump family s faces.Buzzfeed s Jon Passantino posted a photo on Twitter of the Trump family as Cruz spoke, and it was just ugly.The look on the Trumps faces as they watched Cruz s speech pic.twitter.com/0FoGaoM9Xp  Jon Passantino (@passantino) July 21, 2016Others in the crowd reacted very negatively.

But for his own selfish reasons, to keep that one last shred of dignity he has left, Cruz did what we all have a responsibility to do: he took a stand against Donald Trump. Sure, his method was simply a refusal to endorse, but the rest of us have an opportunity to do more by heading to the polls in November and saying  no  to the sort of hate that Donald Trump spreads.Be sure to vote BLUE on Election Day. In the mean time, enjoy the looks on the Trump family s faces. Cherish them. Remember them. You ll be seeing them again in November.Featured image via screengrab",News,"July 21, 2016"
8174, Here’s The Ted Cruz Ad Starring An Adult Film Star He Doesn’t Want You To See (VIDEO),"Ted Cruz s presidential campaign has pulled an ad featuring a softcore adult film star. The ad, titled  Conservatives Anonymous,  was an attack ad focused on Senator Marco Rubio. In the production, a support group for conservatives talks about being betrayed by Rubio and his flip-flop on immigration.One of the conservatives in the group is played by actress Amy Lindsay, who tells the group,  maybe you should vote for more than just a pretty face next time. When they were asked about Lindsay, the Cruz campaign apparently panicked.Lindsay has appeared in several softcore porn films, including Erotic Confessions, Carnal Wishes, Secrets of a Chambermaid, and Insatiable Desires.BuzzFeed News, after learning of Lindsay s prior filmography, requested comment from the Cruz campaign. Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler told BuzzFeed News in a statement that the campaign is taking the ad down and replacing it with a different one. The actress responded to an open casting call. She passed her audition and got the job. Unfortunately, she was not vetted by the production company. Had the campaign known of her full filmography, we obviously would not have let her appear in the ad,  Tyler said.The revelation comes at a bad time for Cruz. He came in third place in the New Hampshire primary after winning the Iowa caucuses, and hopes to capitalize on social conservative support in order to win the South Carolina primary.Cruz was supported by the right-wing conservative Family Leader, who in the past has called for opposition to pornography which it lumped in with abortion and prostitution as a type of  coercion or stolen innocence. The ad had received praise from conservatives and journalists when it was released on YouTube earlier on Thursday.Now the YouTube page for the ad shows that the video  has been removed by the user.

2751, WATCH: Jake Tapper STUNNED Into Disbelief Listening To Sean Spicer Whine That Press Says ‘Ban’,"Sean Spicer is doing his level best to make enemies out of the press and paint Trump as a victim of the media s alarmist lies. Or something. Today it was about Trump s Muslim ban   Spicer seems to be irritated that the media keeps saying  ban.  Apparently, Spicer thinks that everyone needs to stop using that word because Trump s Muslim ban is not a ban of any sort. Trump said so.CNN s Jake Tapper couldn t seem to keep his jaw off the floor while covering Spicer s comments. Trump said  ban  on Twitter, and Sean Spicer has said  ban  multiple times himself. Tapper starts off with Spicer s comments, and then launches into a fact-check: Not a ban, okay. But I could ve sworn I heard somebody in the Trump administration using the term  ban  before. Was it possibly President Trump, on Twitter? Oh well gee, with it up in print, one would think Spicer would be a little smarter. Not only is he not, though, he seems to have forgotten that he himself used the word  ban  to describe the Muslim ban multiple times himself.Tapper wonders aloud why, if Spicer objects to a term, he keeps using it.

2797, DHS Officials Tried To Stop Trump’s Unlawful Muslim Ban — Steve Bannon Overruled Them,"Donald Trump signed an executive order on Friday which enacted the Muslim ban he has been promising for months. A federal judge temporarily blocked the order on Saturday. But now, it appears that Trump s advisor Steve Bannon, who just happens to be a white supremacist, overruled the Department of Homeland Security to pass the bigoted ban in the first place.Like most of Trump s actions, he didn t really bother to consult anybody except for his inner circle about this executive order. He says that he only surrounds himself with the best people but none of them actually have a clue WTF they are doing when it comes to the law. When Trump signed the order nobody even knew what countries were affected by the ban.According to CNN,  the policy team at the White House developed the executive order on refugees and visas, and largely avoided the traditional interagency process that would have allowed the Justice Department and homeland security agencies to provide operational guidance. It wasn t until after Trump had signed his name on the dotted line that DHS really got a chance to sit down and try to determine if the order was even legal. A person with knowledge of the matter said that homeland security staff didn t even get to lay eyes on the order until Friday. Even Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Department of Homeland Security leadership didn t get to see the document until just before Trump signed it into law. The administration also chose not to allow the Office of Legal Counsel to provide legal guidance on the matter.After they were finally allowed to review the order, DHS reportedly decided that the ban could not apply to green card holders, who are legal residents of the U.S., but Trump s Bannon overruled them. CNN reports:It was finally decided that decisions on whether or not to allow green card holders to enter the U.S. would be made on a case by case basis, but directives issued to airlines clearly state that lawful permanent residents are not included and may continue to travel to the USA.  This would include green card holders as they are  lawful permanent residents  of the United States.A source close to the administration said that Bannon had been heading up the directives regarding green cards. No doubt Bannon, with his racist  alt-right  ideologies, is running point on this whole mission. This is what happens when you let a white supremacist run the country.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"January 29, 2017"
3316, Newt Gingrich Admits Trump Is No Longer Draining The Swamp,"It s no secret that Trump s  drain the swamp  shtick was just that -B.S. Since being elected last month, Trump has ben naming the dirtiest, swampiest monsters to head his cabinet and Administration. Bankers, donors, politicians galore are lining up to turn the United States into a fascist regime for the rich and powerful.Yet, somehow, his voters don t believe it for a second. They re still convinced he s going to drain the swamp, and anyone who says otherwise is just trying to tear him down.Only New Gingrich, and his all-knowing wisdom, inadvertently has exposed Trump for the fraud he really is. Talking to NPR s  Morning Edition,  the former Speaker (who left in disgrace), told reporters that Donald Trump will no longer be using the  cute  slogan of  drain the swamp  because it s not going to happen:I m told he now just disclaims that. He now says it was cute, but he doesn t want to use it anymore   [He had] written what I thought was a very cute tweet about  the alligators are complaining,  but somebody wrote back and said they were tired of hearing this stuff.And just like that, another Trump promise   and one of his biggest   goes down in flames because the elite Republicans (which includes Gingrich) don t want to hear it anymore. So that makes Trump either a liar or a turtle-on-a-fencepost. Or both. Gingrich added that  he s in a different role now, and maybe he feels that as president, as the next president of the United States, that he should be marginally more dignified than talking about alligators in swamps. Not only is he being  more dignified  than th alligators, he s giving them government positions   like the Treasury Department, the SEC, and even the Transportation Department.And just like that, Trump drops another thing people trusted him with. Get ready for four years of betrayal, lies, and rolling over for th very establishment he vowed to fight.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images",News,"December 21, 2016"

She allegedly then got into a fight with bar staff on the way out.The video of her outside the club, which has since gone viral, was shared on Facebook by New York City comic Wil Sylvince. You guys are f***ing dictators  You re f***ing c**k suckers,  Campbell was filmed telling the police officer outside. I did not do s**t, I stood there and laughed like the rest of the audience like I should. I did not disrupt anybody. The officer, who remained incredibly calm, told Campbell and another man she was with to walk away. Or what? Or what, mother f***er? Lick my a**hole,  Campbell told him.  How about that? F***ing piece of s**t. That s why nobody likes f***ing police  in this f***ing town. The cop proceeded to place Campbell in handcuffs after she appeared to spit in the face of a man standing outside the club. She bizarrely took off her shoe and told the man to smell it.

8238," Marco ‘Roboto’ Rubio Short-Circuits Again, Repeats Same Line Twice In 30 Seconds (VIDEO)","Once a broken record, always a broken record. At least that s what Marco Rubio has been demonstrating since his disastrous debate performance on Saturday.As you ll recall, Chris Christie absolutely hammered Rubio for using a canned line about President Obama over and over again. Let s dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn t know what he s doing,  Rubio said during his exchange with the New Jersey governor.  He knows exactly what he s doing. He went on to repeat the line several more times, leading to Christie nailing Rubio for being scripted.Rubio s robotic performance has inspired people to troll him by dressing up and appearing at Rubio rallies as robots.One would think that Rubio would more carefully monitor his speeches to make sure that he doesn t come off as a broken record, but he either doesn t give a damn or he thinks voters are stupid and won t notice.On Tuesday, Rubio repeated himself once again during a rally in New Hampshire as he talked about raising his children in the 21st Century, and he actually repeated the same line twice back-to-back. Because as you saw, Jeanette and I are raising our four children in the 21st century and we know how hard it s become to instill our values in our kids instead of the values they try to ram down our throats. In the 21st century it s become harder than ever to instill in your children the values they teach in our homes and in our church instead of the values that they try to ram down our throats in the movies, in music, in popular culture. Here s the video via YouTube:Clearly, Marco Rubio is having a hard time shaking the appearance of being a scripted robot who glitches out, which certainly does not help him look like a viable candidate for president. Not only do we not need a president who will repeat the disastrous policies of past Republican presidents, we do not need a president who relies on canned lines to communicate with the American people.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"February 9, 2016"
7033, Billionaire Mogul Steve Cohen Pledges Nearly $300 Million To Give Veterans Free Healthcare,"In an age where billionaires are buying elections, tearing down the environment in pursuit of oil and gas, evading their taxes and just screwing over humanity in general, some are doing genuine good.Take billionaire hedge fund manager Steve Cohen, for instance. Cohen, founder and CEO of Point72 Asset Management and S.A.C. Capital Advisors, has pledged through his newest endeavor The Cohen Veteran s Network a whopping $275 million for our veterans. His goal? To provide them with free mental healthcare by picking up the cost. An additional $30 million will be used for research programs through Cohen Veteran Bioscience.In a statement, Cohen, who is worth over $11 billion, and his network partner Dr. Anthony Hassan, praised United States  veterans and called on America to  pay the debt  of gratitude:The wounds of war are serious. It is not easy to serve your country in combat overseas and then come back into society seamlessly, especially if you are suffering. These men and women have paid an incredible price and it s important that this country pays back that debt. We will treat anyone who served in the U.S. Armed Forces during the war on terror. If you wore the uniform, and you need help, you are welcome at Cohen Veterans Network period. The $275 million will be spent over the next five years to open 25 clinics all across the country, collectively named the Steven A. Cohen Military Family Clinics. So far, four are scheduled to open in July in southwestern cities including Dallas, Los Angeles and San Antonio. One will open in New York, and by the spring of next year, one will be opened in Philadelphia.According to the CVN website, goals of the network are:Cohen, a Republican, recently made a hefty donation of $2 million to now failed presidential candidate Chris Christie, and currently has a son, Robert, who served in the United States military.Some billionaires are bad. Some billionaires make mistakes (some that are illegal). Some don t take responsibility for their actions and give back to their communities.

1427, House Majority Leader REVELATION: ‘I Think Putin Pays Trump’,"House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy   one of Trump s strongest allies in Congress   divulged a hugely explosive statement during a closed-door conversation on Capitol Hill with GOP leader buddies: He thinks Trump receives payments from Vladimir Putin.The Washington Post reported Wednesday that McCarthy (R-Calif.) said,  There s two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump.  This statement was made in a June 15, 2016, recording that was verified by The Washington Post. Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican, is well known in Congress for her outspoken defense of Russia and Putin.Immediately after the statement was made, Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) abruptly interjected and stopped the conversation, having the Republicans who were present in the conversation swear to keep it secret.Prior to the conversation, Ryan and McCarthy had just finished talks with Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman, who had been discussing Kremlin tactics to finance populist politicians with the goal of undercutting democratic institutions in Eastern Europe.Laughter from some of the lawmakers in response to McCarthy s comment can be heard on the recording, with McCarthy quickly adding:  Swear to God. These Remarks were kept secret for almost a year.The GOP has found itself under growing pressure over Trump s conduct, and this conversation gives us a small glimpse into the views of GOP leaders who have been keeping their mouths shut to the public. It s hard to tell how literal these remarks were meant to be taken, but the recording shows that GOP leaders want to keep their conversations about Russia s election involvement VERY secret.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"May 17, 2017"
3964, GOP Governor Calls Blacks “Colored People” (VIDEO),"Georgia s Republican governor Nathan Deal stirred up a hornet s nest of controversy when comments he made referring to black Americans as  colored people  surfaced on Wednesday night.Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal (R) went after opponents of an education ballot measure known as Amendment 1 in a speech last month, saying if they wanted to help  colored people,  this measure was a good place to start. The irony of some of the groups who are opposing doing something to help these minority children is beyond my logic. If you want to advance the state of colored people, start with their children,  Deal said in an Oct. 3 speech, Fox 5 in Atlanta reported Wednesday.Deal told a local news station that he meant to reference the NAACP, and didn t mean to say  colored people,  which is a dubious claim at best.The governor is a former member of congress who once wrote a formal letter to the Obama White House to formally raise questions about President Obama s place of birth as part of the birther conspiracy theory.Many have pointed out that the birther conspiracy is steeped in racist attitudes about the presidency and President Obama being the first black president, who was quickly challenged to present papers verifying his place of birth (it is Hawaii).Deal s comments come precisely when Republicans are still being forced to grapple with their presidential nominee Donald Trump s blatant embrace of racism. Trump s bigoted push has emboldened cells of white supremacists, who see their beliefs reflected in his words. That includes former Klansman David Duke, who is now a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Louisiana. And on the same night Deal s comments were publicized, Duke took part in a debate at a historically black university. Within the Republican Party, Duke has attracted a small following, but enough to qualify him for the debate stage.Featured image via screen capture",News,"November 3, 2016"
4336, Asian American Organizations RAIN HELL Upon Fox News For Racist Chinatown Segment,"Asian Americans are pissed off after Fox News ran a segment featuring racist Bill O Reilly goon Jesse Watters in Chinatown.O Reilly and Watters billed the edition of Watter s World as  good fun  and and mere  political humor. Watters literally strolled through New York City s Chinatown asking residents if they know karate and if they can  take care of North Korea for us.  Let s just say the segment pushed every stereotype about Asian people Watters and O Reilly could think of. Even O Reilly acknowledged that Fox News would get some letters.Here s the video via YouTube: [ad3media campaign= 1065 ]But they got WAY more than just some letters. The backlash has been swift and brutal as Asian American organizations from across the country condemn Fox News across the board for being so despicably and blatantly racist.Asian Americans Advancing Justice wrote, It is unconscionable that a news organization would sanction a segment that laughs at a community of people, including Watters ridiculing elderly Chinese Americans who were limited English proficient. Although The O Reilly Factor may believe this was  all in good fun,  the segment does nothing more than play up every offensive stereotype of Asian Americans that the community has fought against for decades. What they should have done is to talk about the important role that Asian Americans can play in this upcoming election. The Asian American Journalists Association also condemned the segment. The Asian American Journalists Association (AAJA) is outraged and shocked by the Oct. 3rd segment of  Watters  World  on Fox News   The O Reilly Factor.  The segment was billed as a report on Chinese Americans  views on the U.S. presidential election but it was rife with racist stereotypes, drew on thoughtless tropes and openly ridiculed Asian Americans It s 2016. We should be far beyond tired, racist stereotypes and targeting an ethnic group for humiliation and objectification on the basis of their race. Sadly, Fox News proves it has a long way to go in reporting on communities of color in a respectful and fair manner. The National Council of Asian Pacific Americans also slammed Fox News. It is not  all in good fun  to perpetuate racist stereotypes about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and it certainly is not  gentle fun  to target or mock people who are not fluent in English. No person should be used as a prop in such a heartless manner. Asian And Pacific Islander American Vote chimed in as well.Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote (APIAVote) is appalled by the recent  Watters  World  segment on The O Reilly Factor on Chinese American voters. The segment exploited Asian American stereotypes and exemplified the very issue of China-bashing the report supposedly sought to assess. This racist and derogatory segment damages Chinese American and Asian American communities and exacerbates negative stereotypes towards our communities.It is clear that the intent of this segment began from a desire to employ racist stereotypes to ridicule and mock Chinese American voters, and was never a serious attempt to understand the preferences or opinions of these voters after the first presidential debate.In addition, the Asian American Legal Defense Fund also had words for Fox via Twitter.This racist mocking of people in NY #Chinatown makes clear that @FoxNews doesn t care about Asian American voters. https://t.co/uTfr8WkoME  AsianAmericanLegal (@aaldef) October 5, 2016The Organization of Chinese Americans had even stronger words. This segment was grossly offensive to Chinese Americans and all Asian Pacific Americans who have ever had to suffer through the many false equivocations and damaging stereotypes that were mentioned in rapid-fire succession during the show. By going to the Chinese American community under the auspices of journalism and then unleashing a barrage of offensive stereotypes, Bill O Reilly, Jesse Watters, and Fox News have completely trivialized the community s view on this important election. At a time when politicians have fallen back on xenophobia to get ahead in the polls, it is disheartening to hear such offensive behavior come out of the media even as our power in the political process grows. Fox News should immediately disavow the segment and apologize to the Chinese American community for making a mockery of their language, culture, and political views. Fox News had better offer a sincere apology soon because they clearly pissed off a large segment of the population. Bill O Reilly and Jesse Watters should be ashamed of themselves and they should be removed from the network. But that would require that anyone at Fox News has a conscience.Featured Image: Dangerous Minds",News,"October 6, 2016"
3706," Republicans Declare WAR On The Poor, Go After Food Stamps, Medical Coverage","Donald Trump has won the White House and now, Republicans have control of the Senate and Congress, too. House Speaker Paul Ryan has hinted at plans to privatize Medicare. Ryan s Ayn Randish vision for America has been well documented with his plans to slash the safety net while giving a big middle finger to the middle and lower-income classes.Yes, this is a war. One in which Americans will suffer greatly. Millions of low-income Americans on Medicaid could lose their health coverage if Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress follow through with their plans.Vox reports that Trump has: already endorsed Ryan s plans on Medicaid and has attacked food stamps at length. His vice president, Mike Pence, is a longtime friend and congressional ally of Ryan s who if anything has argued for larger cuts than the ones Ryan wants.We can expect an increase in poverty. I ve been working on these issues since 1972,  Robert Greenstein, the founder and president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and Washington s leading advocate for poor and low-income Americans, said, according to Vox.  This is by far the gravest threat to the safety net, and to low-income people, that I ve seen in my close to half a century of working on these issues. I think there s a potential in the first seven months, by the August recess, for Congress to pass policies that do more to increase poverty and hardship and widen inequality than we ve seen in half a century. If Obamacare is repealed without a viable replacement, 22 million people will be denied coverage.Paul Ryan, like his conservative colleagues, seeks fewer regulations for insurance companies. Insurance companies would offer worse policies and the quality of care would go down.Trump s replacement plan is even worse than Ryan s.The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates it d spare just 1 million people who d otherwise lose insurance through Obamacare repeal. Full repeal without replacement takes insurance away from 22 million; Trump s plan takes it away from 21 million. The difference is minimal.And yet, here s the thing. Trump has already broken numerous campaign promises and he s not even in office yet. He has suggested that he won t fully repeal Obamacare but now, he s beholden to Republicans who control the Senate and the House. Even if he says no, the wheels are in motion. He s the one who started turning them.Because eating while poor is bad:CBPP estimates that the most recent House budget gets 62 percent of its cuts from programs for low- and moderate-income people. That includes at least $150 billion in cuts to food stamps and nearly $500 billion in mostly unspecified cuts to other low-income programs like SSI (which provides cash to the disabled and elderly), Pell Grants, and what little remains of welfare.Republicans have been trying to eradicate President Obama s signature healthcare legislation so it was watered down. Tea Party Republicans went to town halls where Democrats attempted to answer questions from constituents. The noise from Republicans was deafening and hardly a word could be heard about the bill. So, it got watered down because conservatives told us that socialism is bad. They told us this after driving to the town hall meetings on taxpayer funded public roads.As it happens, medical professionals do not want Obamacare repealed. Trump and his Republican colleagues just want you to think that.Featured image via Zach Gibson/Getty Images",News,"November 22, 2016"
5098, New Study PROVES It’s Republicans Who Are To Blame For Slow Economy,"When Donald Trump isn t busy insulting Gold Star families or inciting his followers to assassinate his presidential opponent, he spends a lot of time talking about the dreadful Obama economy   one in which, admittedly, growth is slow. A new study, though, shows that Trump is pointing his stumpy finger in the wrong direction. The blame lies squarely with his Republican party.The report was published by the Economic Policy Institute. It blames Republican austerity, not Democratic spending, for the fact that economic growth was just 1.2 percent during the second quarter, and frankly, it hasn t been spectacular for a long time. It s easy to blame the man in the White House, which is what Republicans do, but they are wrong.The EPI places the blame on 2011 s Republican budget cuts, fiscal austerity at the state and local levels, GOP states  refusal to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Instead of cutting spending during the recovery from the Great Recession, we should have been spending more   specifically on infrastructure and on programs that help people.This economic recovery has been the slowest over the past four business cycles. For example, the employment recovery from the trough of the Great Recession to its pre-recession peak took 51 months. Following the recession in the 1980s, employment recovery took 11 months. In the early 1990s it took 23 months, and in the early 2000s it took 39 months.The US government would have had to spend an additional $1tn in 2015 alone to match the spending that followed the 1980s recession, Bivens said. While such spending might run up the US deficit   something Republicans in Congress are opposed to   it would also have led to  several years of full employment  and the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates.Source: The GuardianAnother problem is the low interest rates. During the recovery from the 80s recession, the interest rates started at 9.3 percent. Now, with interest rates approaching 0 percent, and have been for a long time, there s no place to move them.The study does place some blame on the Obama administration, though. He didn t make effective enough use of the bully pulpit.The Obama administration  could have made a louder and more consistent case that the slow recovery had concrete, identifiable roots in decisions made by the Congress,  Bivens wrote.  Had the Obama administration made such a powerful case for why austerity was hampering growth, it could have educated the public and potentially helped build support for more sensible policy the next time the United States faces a recession.

I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians,  Sessions responded.And as we now know, that was a complete and total lie that was told under oath.In other words, Sessions perjured himself in front of Congress.So far, Sessions has refused to resign, and that makes him a hypocrite considering what he once said about Bill Clinton in 1999 after Republicans failed to impeach the former president.According to the New York Times, here is what Sessions had to say after the acquittal.It has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty that President William Jefferson Clinton perjured himself before a Federal grand jury and has persisted in a continuous pattern of lying and obstructing justice. The chief law-enforcement officer of the land, whose oath of office calls on him to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution, crossed the line and failed to defend and protect the law and, in fact, attacked the law and the rights of a fellow citizen. Under our Constitution, equal justice requires that he forfeit his office. For these reasons, I felt compelled to vote to convict and remove the President from office. . . .It is crucial to our system of justice that we demand the truth. I fear that an acquittal of this President will weaken the legal system by providing an option for those who consider being less than truthful in court. Whereas the handling of the case against President Nixon clearly strengthened the nation s respect for law, justice and truth, the Clinton impeachment may unfortunately have the opposite result.Now the man who called for  equal justice  and said  we demand the truth  just got caught committing perjury and he is refusing to forfeit his office.Having an extramarital affair is not against the law. But Republicans decided to go on a political witch hunt for it back in the 1990s even though several of those lawmakers who voted to impeach Clinton were themselves caught cheating on their spouses.Colluding with the Russians during a critical election on behalf of the Republican candidate and lying about it under oath is far worse than anything Bill Clinton ever did.By all rights, Sessions should be impeached from office, but Republicans are only interested in impeaching officials if it helps their agenda. They are hypocrites and the whole lot of them do not deserve to hold office in this country.It s time for Jeff Sessions to look at himself in the mirror and decide if equal justice and the truth are as important to him now as he claimed it was then. Because if not, he should not be the Attorney General.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"March 3, 2017"
8551, US Marine Puts Sarah Palin In Her Place For Blaming PTSD To Excuse Son’s Violent Behavior,"In an amazing open letter, a former US Marine slammed America s village idiot for having the gall to blame President Obama and PTSD for her son s domestic violence arrest.On the same day she incoherently endorsed Donald Trump as the Republican nominee, it was reported that Track Palin had been arrested on weapons and domestic violence charges.Rather than acknowledge that her son broke the law and is responsible for his own actions, Palin chose to blame President Obama and PTSD instead, even though Track Palin never saw combat during his one year in Iraq. It s a shame that our military personnel even have to question, have to wonder if they re respected anymore,  Palin said. It starts from the top. The question, though, it comes from the top, the question, though, that comes from our own president where they have to look at him and wonder,  Do you know what we go through? Do you know what we re trying to do to secure America and to secure the freedoms that have been bequeathed us? My son, like so many others, they come back a bit different. They come back hardened, they come back wondering if there s that respect for what it is their fellow soldiers and airmen and every other member of the military have so sacrificially given to this country.So when my own son is going through what he goes through coming back, I can certainly relate with other families who kind of feel these ramifications of PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with, and it makes me realize more than ever, it is now or never for the sake of America s finest that we ll have that commander-in-chief who will respect them and honor them. Needless to say, Palin instantly pissed off veterans across the country, including former US Marine Chris Mark, who also happens to be a Republican.In an open letter posted on his blog, Mark ripped Palin to shreds for using PTSD as a political attack and for using it to excuse her son s behavior. I am not surprised that you would choose to use this very serious condition as a political football and, once again, attempt to divert blame from your own family s abhorrent, violent behavior,  Mark said.After reminding Palin that her entire family was involved in a drunken brawl that should have served as sign that Track has a problem, he went after Palin for stigmatizing PTSD even more than it already is by th media.Calling her statements  foolish and ignorant,  Mark wrote that he would prefer Palin  avoid public life and simply fade away.  But since she refuses to go away, Mark suggested she educate herself and then use her status as a public figure to help veterans.Here s the full letter via Global Security, Privacy, & Risk Management blog.Dear Mrs. Palin,I am a former US Marine and US Navy Officer with a Combat Action Ribbon as well as service connected disabilities. I am also a Republican. I have also served with, and am friends with, dozens of combat veterans who suffer daily from various injuries and wounds to include PTSD. I recently read your comments related to PTSD in which you attempted to excuse your son s arrest on domestic abuse charges and firearm charges by referencing his supposed PTSD. Based upon your previous comments I am not surprised that you would choose to use this very serious condition as a political football and, once again, attempt to divert blame from your own family s abhorrent, violent behavior.In 2014 your entire family was involved in a late night  drunken brawl  at a party in which Track Palin (the accused domestic abuser) was involved in a bloody fight. While you publicly stated how proud you were at your children s violent actions, maybe this should have been a sign that Track has a problem. It is certainly curious that you did not feel the need to reference his supposed PTSD in this situation and instead stated:  my kids  defense of family makes my heart soar!  Maybe, instead of encouraging Track s violence, you should have taken the opportunity to get him help. Maybe, instead of being the result of PTSD, your son was simply trying to uphold the stated Palin family values and  make your heart soar  by abusing a woman.PTSD is stigmatized in the media and not well understood by the general public. An estimated 22 veterans commit suicide every day in the United States. This is nearly 8,000 veterans who take their lives every year. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) stated:  Every day in the United States, 22 veterans succumb to suicide   losing their personal battle to invisible wounds of war.  Veterans who have willingly given so much in service to their country should not have to bear the burden of being further stigmatized by your ignorant and foolish statements.While I do not propose to speak for all veterans, I am clearly not alone in my views regarding your unfortunate statements. They were unfortunate for the many veterans who face further disdain and discrimination based upon your inaccurate and ignorant portrayal of those who suffer with PTSD as well as the causes of the condition.While I would personally prefer that you simply avoid public life and simply fade away, if you insist on trying to use your  celebrity status  for a cause, please educate yourself on the facts of PTSD and try to help veterans by using your significant influence in a more productive, and less political manner. There are a number of veteran s organizations to which you can donate time, money and energy to make a difference.Regards,Chris MarkAnd there you have it. Sarah Palin made an ass of herself in public again and this Marine called out her stupidity, much like another veteran did during a rally in 2013 after Ted Cruz managed to persuade his fellow conservatives to shut the government down. Palin attempted to use veterans to criticize President Obama for not bowing down to Republican demands when one veteran reminded everyone that she s an idiot.But Palin really stepped in it this time around and now she has to answer to veterans across the country who actually deal with PTSD every day. She owes all of them a huge apology.Featured Image: Fox News",News,"January 24, 2016"

2885, Inaugural Cake Baker Brilliantly Schools Anti-Gay Bakers In How Protest Is Done,"Around the time same sex marriage was making headlines, a handful of cake bakers across the country threw temper tantrums and refused to bake wedding cakes for anyone who didn t pass their rigid moral test (i.e., wasn t marrying someone of the opposite sex).

7585, Texas Gun Nuts Want ‘A Clear Shot’ At President Obama During Event (IMAGES),"A bunch of rabid gun-toting conservatives would like the Secret Service to know that President Obama is a target.President Obama plans to speak at the South by Southwest technology and music convention on Friday, so some crazy open carry activists came up with the idea to try to intimidate and taunt him at the event by openly carrying their firearms, with one even urging his fellow gun nuts to make sure they  get a clear shot  and assassinate him if they get a chance.CJ Grisham pointed out that President Obama would be at the event this year and announced to his buddies that he would be carrying his rifle and handing out gun nut literature.  This may get interesting,  he remarked.Jovan Jackson then commented that CJ should carry a pistol instead because hippies  scare easy. Here s a screenshot of the post via FreakOutNation.And that s when Kriss Elliot chimed in in an apparent effort to get on the Secret Service s radar.An Azure Solutions Consultant at Insight Enterprises, Elliot actually encouraged his friends to find President Obama and murder him with their guns if they get the opportunity. If you get a clear shot, please fire for effect!  he wrote.Again, this piece of crap Texan literally said,  If you get a clear shot, please fire for effect!  which sounds like a direct threat against the life of the sitting President of the United States.Not everyone thought that sounded like a good idea, however. Harry Graybill warned that attempting to kill President Obama would mean prison for the open carry activists who carried out the assassination effort and would damage their pro-gun crusade. He failed to mention that they d literally be trying to end the life of a human being.Here s a screenshot of that post as well.It s not enough that Texas already has the blood of one US President on their hands, now they want a second one, too.

22529,US Media Hyped ‘Active Shooter’ Drill at Andrews Base As Real Event,"21st Century Wire says Yesterday, we were told by US media that one of the country s key military installations, Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, home of the president s Air Force One airliner, was in lockdown following reports of an  Active Shooter  situation.While the entire US media went into orange alert mode for over 2 and a half hours, 21WIRE recognized exactly what it was, a drill, and called it correctly while the news was breaking. We re told that initial reports of a  active shooter  were prompted by an emergency 911 call to outside law enforcement about a gunman seen on the base. The fact that this alleged  distress call  came from a  staff member  at the Malcolm Grow Medical Facility located inside Andrews (one of the country s most secure closed military facilities) should have raised some pertinent questions   like why base security were not informed first, as one would expect. Furthermore, any reports by the US mainstream media characterizing the event as a genuine  active shooter  crisis should have been immediately squashed by the fact that Joint Base Andrews was also running a no-notice  Active Shooter Exercise scheduled for 9 am that morning. Sadly, this did not happen, and all US media outlets began their crisis reporting   complete with the usual panel of security  experts  and  justice correspondents on CNN and other mainstream networks.21WIRE Calls it CorrectlyWhile the US media was reporting the base was in full lockdown and appeared  confused  about what to make of the situation, 21WIRE analyst Patrick Henningsen appeared on RT International while the story was breaking, offering a very different take on the event than what was being reported at the time throughout the US media. Here s what he said:PART 1: PART 2: Finally, 1 hour later, US authorities finally admitted that  it was only a drill  and that the dramatic lockdown had been lifted.Some might say this was not a hard event to call, and in fact was a  no-brainer    and in this case they would be correct. For any keen student of false flags and high-profile mass shootings in recent years, it was overtly obvious what kind of drama was playing out.The real story however, is how the entire US media transformed into one giant web of media disinformation amplification from the moment the false media reports and  official Tweets  from the US military hit the news wires   without even pausing to consider that they were all knowing, or unknowing (but certainly willing) participants within their media/press compartment of the so-called  Active Shooter  drill.JBA is currently on lockdown due to a report of an active shooter. All personnel are directed to shelter in place. More info as it comes.  Joint Base Andrews (@JBA_NAFW) June 30, 2016The mainstream media did their level best to use this falsely presented nonevent in order to reinforce the federal government s prime PR compliance directives; a running list of mindless Orwellian police state throw away slogans like,  See something, say something,  and  Shelter in place. The end result of all this is a public who are unnecessarily traumatized, or subjected to psychological stress, in effect terrorizing the public, as a result of poor media reporting and dereliction of journalism by a media profession who are all too happy to go along with a high TV ratings draw of a  Active Shooter  narrative.Rather amazingly, one reporter from CBS News even admitted that the national  lockdown  scare did not even interrupt that day s drill and that their on-base Active Shooter exercise would continue throughout the day. This should provide as much evidence as one would need to deduce that the media scare was indeed part of the drill itself, although this concept might prove just too difficult to grasp for any US mainstream news anchor or reporter. Watch the CBS report here:  What happened is a common thing, it s just, you know, it s sort of the times we live in  there were two personnel carrying rifles, long guns, someone in the medical center saw that and phoned in there was a shooter on the base Williams then brushed the misreporting off as  normal,  before also parroting the tired mantra,  When you see something, say something.  Watch as a confused Williams tries to rationalize the day s over-the-top media debacle: Luckily, it did not, but yesterdays event does raise some very crucial questions about the highly reactionary and irrational nature of our security-obsessed media, and a police state  fusion  apparatus which spends hundreds of millions of taxpayer funds each year in order prepare for some ubiquitous  threat  which statistically does not actually threaten very many Americans and yet   seems to overly-dominate media coverage, as well the operating budgets government agencies and first responder cohorts nationwide.The following is a short video which every American should watch, which explains some of the more worrying aspects of America s new obsession with domestic hyper militarized responses   in preparation for what seems like an endless stream of  mass shooting  and  domestic terror  events: Support our work and Become a Member @ 21WIRE.TV",US_News,"July 1, 2016"

You know, what Obama has been saying for years.The Guardian reports: A participant, paraphrasing McMaster, said:  He said he doesn t want to call it radical Islamic terrorism because the terrorists are, quote,  un-Islamic . McMaster, the participant said, indicated that the phrase castigates  an entire religion  and  he s not on board .At the meeting, multiple sources said, McMaster discomfited White House staffers who view the terrorist threat in those religious terms and who were said to have exchanged awkward looks with each other.Participants who attended the meeting said they were shocked by how different McMaster s views are from those of Trump, who has dropped the phrase  radical Islamic terrorism  at any chance he got.During the meeting, McMaster also let it be known that he disagrees with Trump on several other points as well. He reportedly  laid out a vigorous defense of the post-second world war liberal order, calling it a guarantor of peace and economic prosperity.  Trump, on the other hand, has attacked these same longstanding foreign-policy goals repeatedly.McMaster also took a stance on Russia that is the polar opposite of his Putin loving boss.  One source said McMaster was  very clear  that he viewed Russia  as an adversary,'  the Guardian reports.Trump chose McMaster as his new national security adviser after Flynn was forced to resign when it was revealed that he had told the Russian ambassador not to worry about sanctions during a phone call that took place before Trump was sworn in.Thanks to Trump s Islamophobic policies, at least one prominent NSC staffer has already resigned. Rumana Ahmed, who worked on strategic communications, stepped down after Trump issued his Muslim ban. She said his  radical Islamic terrorism  rhetoric is really no different from the rhetoric of ISIS.Many who attended the meeting were relieved that McMasters doesn t seem to be a complete crazy person when it comes to foreign policy, but they have no idea how that will  work in context with the rest of the White House .Featured image via video screen capture",News,"February 25, 2017"

22731,"TEXAS CHURCH SHOOTER: Years Before ‘Soft Target’ Attack, Gunman Tried to Carry Out Death Threats on CIA Linked Air Force Base","Shawn Helton 21st Century Wire The gunman named in a mass shooting that was said to have killed 26 people at a small church outside of San Antonio was convicted by the military several years before the tragic attack in 2012. This past week new information concerning the apparent First Baptist Church gunman 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, revealed that the previously convicted Air Force airman was already well-known to authorities via his  bad conduct discharge  from the military in 2012. The recent acknowledgement in Kelley s case history, coupled with his unusually relaxed plea bargain deal, has only prompted more questions from those concerned about the most recent high-profile mass shooting in America.According to officials, the Sutherland Springs shooting at the First Baptist Church may have been caused by a domestic dispute involving Kelley and his ex-mother-in-law Michelle Shields. However, it turns out that Shields was not present at church services on the morning of the mass shooting, although her mother was named as one of the victims.A more precise motive in the deadly Sutherland Springs massacre has yet to be uncovered by authorities   TEXAS CHURCH SHOOTING    8 years after the Fort Hood mass shooting, the First Baptist Church attack raises big questions. Its also worth noting, the recent church shooting echoes a scene in the 2015 Hollywood film Kingsman: The Secret Service. (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)The Texas Church ShooterWhile many in media have focused on the military s inability to log Devin Patrick Kelley s domestic violence court-martial case into a federal database, a police report from 2012 revealed that the gunman named in the First Baptist Church shooting had been previously caught attempting to sneak firearms onto a CIA linked military base in New Mexico where he was stationed. The El Paso police report concluded that after Kelley escaped the mental health facility believed to be Peak Behavioral Health Services Center in Santa Teresa, he sought to carry out death threats against his superiors at New Mexico s Holloman Air Force base.A CBS Affiliate from Dallas further explained the church shooter s lengthy criminal background: The information was contained in a police incident report after Devin Patrick Kelley briefly escaped in June, 2012 from a mental health facility in New Mexico where he had been committed. KPRC television in Houston first reported about the escape. Police in El Paso, Texas, where Kelley was caught after the escape, said in the report that an official of the mental health facility told them that Kelley  was a danger to himself and others. The report says that Kelley had already been caught sneaking firearms onto Holloman Air Force base. It also says that he  was attempting to carry out death threats that (Kelley) had made on his military chain of command. Moreover, a FOX News report just days ago revealed additional information concerning Kelley s violent threats at Holloman Air Force base: Former Air Force Staff Sgt. Jessika Edwards told The New York Times that Kelley would shake with rage and vow to kill his superiors when he was assigned menial tasks as punishment for poor performance. At one point, Edwards told the Times, she warned others in the squadron to go easy on Kelley, believing he was likely to come back and  shoot up the place. Rather strangely, former Air Force Staff Sgt. Edwards still kept in close contact with the criminally convicted and discharged logistical readiness airman, stating that he asked her to be a job reference in 2015. Shortly there after, Kelley allegedly became obsessed with the polarizing case involving Charleston church shooter Dylann Roof.  CHURCH SHOOTER    What is the real motive in the First Baptist Church shooting? (Image Source: nbcwashington)The shocking claims of death threats prior to the Sutherland Springs church shooting taking place raises questions not only about the criminally convicted shooter Kelley, who was accused of a slew of abusive behavior but also the military s handling of the gunman s well-known history of violence from a prosecutorial standpoint.QUESTION: How did Kelley manage to get such a relaxed sentence considering he had several other major charges dropped   including an additional incident where he allegedly pointed a loaded firearm at his wife?Furthermore, as the public and media are still bewildered over Kelley s ability to legally purchase guns following his 2012 military conviction due to his prior violent abuse, information concerning his alleged plot to kill military superiors has been completely underreported and by the looks of it, may have even gone unpunished.According to official reports, Kelley was sentenced to a year s confinement, reducing rank from an airman first-class (A1C) to airman basic. Additionally, after being convicted of crimes by a military court in 2012, he received a  bad conduct discharge  following an apparent plea deal.The NY Times added the following details regarding the military court case: Prosecutors withdrew several other charges as part of their plea agreement with Mr. Kelley, including allegations that he repeatedly pointed a loaded gun at his wife.He was ultimately sentenced in November that year to 12 months  confinement and reduction to the lowest possible rank. His final duty title was  prisoner. QUESTION: Did Kelley s plea agreement also include the exclusion of charges concerning his alleged death threat plot against military superiors at the CIA linked Holloman Air Force base?Moreover, if that wasn t a part of the plea, how was Kelley not dishonorably discharged due to the severity of charges he faced from military superiors?Although we ve been told this latest  soft target  shooting spree on American soil was carried out by yet another lone gunman, there have also been questions raised concerning a shooter allegedly firing from the roof top down on to church parishioners below.Watch and listen to shooting survivor Rosanne Solis, as she recounts what she witnessed during the First Baptist Church shooting . QUESTION: Is it also possible that Solis saw multiple shooters at the First Baptist Church? If not, how did Kelley swiftly move from the roof top location to ground level in a matter of a few minutes, assuming the account told by Solis is true?The Sutherland Springs mass shooting, along with other high-profile  active shooter  incidents this year and year s past   have once again predictably sparked socio-political hot button issues concerning gun reform, background checks, mental illness and SSRI prescription drugs. This is something that has prompted critics to consider that there might be even more to the story.Below is a CNN video report discussing the lengthy criminal background of the First Baptist Church gunman. Note the strong emphasis in this report regarding Kelley s access to weaponry rather than a deeper analysis over how he received such a relaxed military conviction Drills, Dupes & Informants?A day after the suspicious San Bernardino shooting in 2015, San Antonio s nonprofit Alamo Community Group began practicing active shooter scenarios with employees. San Antonio is only 35 miles from where the Sutherland Springs mass shooting took place and a city that has been rigorously training for mass casualty scenarios for the last five years, holding active shooter drills with approximately one hundred officers a week over at least the last couple of years. Here s a passage from an ABC affiliate in San Antonio on the matter: Though it [the training] is simulated for active shooting scenarios, the training could easily be applied to many other mass casualty situations as well. In past two years, about 4,000 people have been involved in San Antonio s new rescue task force training program. As 21 WIRE has documented over the years, many so-called shooting/terror/attacks involve individuals being monitored by security services prior to an alleged act taking place. A place where a  lone wolf  graduates into the ranks of a known wolf. Although the military wasn t officially keeping Kelley under watch, his case profile does exhibit potential signs of a possible informant status due to the litany of charges he managed to avoid through a cushy plea deal with the military. Historically, government operators have often made use of low-life criminals, and mentally disturbed individuals to fulfill various roles in entrapment stings or sometimes as bona fide solo actors  in an actual attacks.  Links between security agencies, military facilities and alleged attackers with a criminal history should arouse suspicion if they become connected to any future crimes.In January of 2015, a strategic security service think-tank known as The Soufan Group, reported that a larger national security threat resides with those who ve had a lengthy criminal background with known ties to security agencies: The Soufan Group, a New York think tank, said a better term for  lone wolves  would be  known wolves , given how many are already known to Western intelligence agencies before they strike. These individuals, acting alone or in small groups   have been on the radar of various agencies and organisations, highlighting the difficulty of effectively monitoring and managing people at the nexus of criminality and terrorism,  it said in a report this week Domestically in America, it has been well documented that the FBI created a counter-intelligence program known as COINTELPRO (similar in scope to the CIA s Operation CHAOS), not only as a way to influence, but also a way to disrupt and coerce both left and right-wing political factions from the inside out. The FBI program infiltrated countless groups and movements across the political spectrum.Over the past several years, the FBI has been routinely caught foiling their very own terror plots. Following one of America s most deadly mass shootings at the Orlando Pulse nightclub, reports revealed that the FBI had a close relationship with the suspected attacker through the use of a well-known confidential informant. Similarly, recent reports state that FBI, court filings have revealed how the agency allowed an alleged  home grown  ISIS attack to take place in Garland, Texas.  21WIRE had previously uncovered the suspicious nature of the cartoon/shooting event in Garland when it occurred.In 2015, another strange informant case/FBI sting attempted to persuade a group into attacking the Humphrey Scottish Rite Masonic Center in Milwaukee.QUESTION: Is it possible the FBI or any or intelligence agency played some part in the Sutherland Springs church shooting   whether inadvertently or otherwise?FBI informants have reportedly played a  central role  in over 50% of all domestic terror cases in the United States since 2009. According to reports, informants might earn up to $100,000 per case, as they are meant to  build relationships with persons of interest. While the Sutherland Springs shooting is not considered a terror case, it does fit the profile of possible soft target scenarios outlined by the FBI.Here at 21WIRE, we ve kept a running report on many  known wolf  actors and other suspicious intelligence informant cases:Tamerlan Tsarnaev (see his story here) Buford Rogers (see his story here) Jerad Miller (see his story here) Naji Mansour (see his story here) Quazi Mohammad Nafis (see his story here) Mohamed Osman Mohamud (see his story here) Timothy McVeigh (see his story here) Salim Benghalem (see his story here) Michael Adebolajo (see his story here) Daba Deng (see his story here) Elton Simpson (see his story here) Man Haron Monis (see his story here) Abu Hamza (see his story here) Haroon Rashid Aswat (see his story here) Mark Vicars (see his story here) Glen Rodgers (see his story here) Omar Mateen (see his story here)  Samy Mohamed Hamzeh (see his story here) Tashfeen Malik (see her story here) Djamel Beghal (see his story here) Anjem Choudary (see his story here) Cherif Kouachi (see his story here) Said Kouachi (see his story here) Amedy Coulibaly (see his story here) Hayat Boumeddiene (see her story here) Salah Abdeslam (see his story here) Michael Zehaf-Bibeau (see his story here) Nidal Malik Hassan (see his story here) Abdelhakim Dekhar (see his story here) Abdelhamid Abaaoud (see his story here) Samy Amimour (see his story here) Isma l Omar Mostefa (see his story here) Mohamed Lahouij Bouhlel (see his story here) Anis Amri (see his story here) Esteban Santiago-Ruiz (see his story here) Abdulkadir Masharipov (see his story here) Khalid Masood (see his story here) Khuram Butt (see his story here) Youssef Zaghba (see his story here) Sayfullo Saipov (see his story here)According to pastor Frank Pomeroy, who was out-of-town at the time of the shooting with his wife Sherri, the hundred member First Baptist Church, is slated to be demolished sometime soon.

16540,BOOM! Rep Louie Gohmert (R-TX) Rips Into Obama’s Gun Grabbing Legislative Minions: “Radical ISLAM Killed These People!” [VIDEO],"Don t think for a minute this union-style Black Lives Matter/Occupy type  sit-in  wasn t orchestrated in our Oval Office by our Community Organizer in Chief. Obama is desperate to pass gun control legislation before he leaves office. The Democrats who are occupying our House floor are only acting as puppets for his radical agenda. As California Democrat Rep. Brad Sherman spoke Wednesday evening during an unprecedented  sit-in  on Capitol Hill to demand a vote on gun control, Rep. Louis Gohmert (R-TX) interrupted him, shouting:  Radical Islam killed these people!  Sherman, a moderate Democrat from the San Fernando Valley, had joined several dozen of his party colleagues in a protest against House Republicans  refusal to allow votes on several gun regulations   all of which had already failed in the Senate.Though the bills have no chance of becoming law, Democrats hope to win at least one of the votes, which would enable them to argue that by voting Democrat this November, Americans could help them retake the Senate and pass new gun restrictions.The protest was led by Rep. John Lewis (D-GA), who has long drawn on his history in the civil rights movement for partisan purposes, and who hinted last weekend during a Southern California visit that Democrats would  do something  big on guns.The protest was also timed to coincide with, and drown out, a speech in New York by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Trump responded to rival Hillary Clinton s attack earlier this week by criticizing Clinton for alleged corruption at the State Department and for her foreign policy record, while laying out his own alternative economic policies.Rep. Gohmert began heckling Rep. Sherman during his speech   which was broadcast via Periscope by another Californian, Rep. Scott Peters of San Diego, in violation of House rules. At roughly 4:24 in the video below, Gohmert points to a poster of the victims of the June 12 terrorist attack and insists that radical Islam killed them   not the lack of gun control regulations.Via: Breitbart News",Government News,"Jun 23, 2016"

5076, State Department Confirms Hillary Clinton Did Not Use Her Position For Foundation Favors,"Another day, another Hillary Clinton scandal has died in flames. Just this year alone, three scandals   Benghazi, her private email, and now this   have proven to be nothing more than a vast right-wing conspiracy.Recently, the Republican Party has been in an absolute tailspin as their presidential candidate, Donald Trump, crashes and burns in a wreckage of insanity. So what do they do? Why, manufacture another Hillary Clinton scandal to distract from their recklessness.In a recent email dump, questions were raised (which were then inflamed by Donald Trump) regarding the idea that Clinton used her power as Secretary of State to influence her foundation. One email showed the foundation s executive, Doug Band, requesting a meeting between a wealthy donor and an ambassador, and asking for Clinton s aides to find a new job for an associate with the foundation.The completely generic and minuscule emails, which were part of thousands upon thousands released, were completely innocent. But that didn t stop the Republicans from labeling it as  pay for Play. Well the State Department has shut down those asinine, distracting talking points by pointing out that there is no evidence to suggest Clinton, in any way, used her power to accumulate favors for her foundation. State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau told reporters:The State Department is not aware of any actions that were influenced by the Clinton Foundation. The Department does not believe it was inappropriate for Mr. Band or any other individual to recommend someone be considered for employment at the State Department. We also do not believe it s inappropriate for someone recommended in this manner to be potentially hired insofar as they meet the necessary qualifications for the job.The Clinton Foundation and the State Department made it clear that the individual that Band wanted hired (whose name was redacted) was not an employee of the foundation. And even if they were, Trudeau pointed out, that wouldn t necessarily be harbinger for employment, should they have the qualifications to be president.And the ambassador who wanted to meet with a donor? Such thing is commonplace:State Department officials are regularly in touch with a range of outside individuals and organizations, including non-profits, NGOs, think tanks and others.Even though such circumstances are commonplace and have historical precedence, Republicans are still hoping their phony, ill-conceived  scandal  will distract from the disaster that is their presidential candidate.Now Republicans are also toying with the idea she had a DNC staffer killed. Get ready for another season of Clinton  scandals.  Instead of focusing on the issues (which they are so good a evading) they will be doing another round of character assassination.Featured image via Bill Pugliano/Getty Images",News,"August 12, 2016"
17242,GAY MARRIAGE APPROVED BY SUPREME COURT With Ironic Dissenting Opinion From Justice Roberts: “But this court is not a legislature”,"The  Fundamental Transformation  of America is almost complete. Even Barack Hussein Obama must be surprised by how few hurdles have been placed in his way In less than 24 hours, our leftist US Supreme Court delivered not one, but two sucker punches to the heart of America. The acts of these radical judicial activists will have a dramatic effect on our society and culture in the United States of America.    The Supreme Court declared Friday that same-sex couples have a right to marry anywhere in the United States.Gay and lesbian couples already could marry in 36 states and the District of Columbia. The court s 5-4 ruling means the remaining 14 states, in the South and Midwest, will have to stop enforcing their bans on same-sex marriage.The outcome is the culmination of two decades of Supreme Court litigation over marriage, and gay rights generally. Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion, just as he did in the court s previous three major gay rights cases dating back to 1996. It came on the anniversary of two of those earlier decisions. No union is more profound than marriage,  Kennedy wrote, joined by the court s four more liberal justices.The four dissenting justices each filed a separate opinion explaining their views. But this court is not a legislature. Whether same-sex marriage is a good idea should be of no concern to us,  Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in dissent. Roberts read a summary of his dissent from the bench, the first time he has done so in nearly 10 years as chief justice.Justice Antonin Scalia said he is not concerned so much about same-sex marriage, but about  this court s threat to American democracy.  Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas also dissented.The ruling will not take effect immediately because the court gives the losing side roughly three weeks to ask for reconsideration. But some state officials and county clerks might decide there is little risk in issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples.The cases before the court involved laws from Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee that define marriage as the union of a man and a woman. Those states have not allowed same-sex couples to marry within their borders and they also have refused to recognize valid marriages from elsewhere.Just two years ago, the Supreme Court struck down part of the federal anti-gay marriage law that denied a range of government benefits to legally married same-sex couples.The decision in United States v. Windsor did not address the validity of state marriage bans, but courts across the country, with few exceptions, said its logic compelled them to invalidate state laws that prohibited gay and lesbian couples from marrying.The number of states allowing same-sex marriage has grown rapidly. As recently as October, just over one-third of the states permitted same-sex marriage.There are an estimated 390,000 married same-sex couples in the United States, according to UCLA s Williams Institute, which tracks the demographics of gay and lesbian Americans. Another 70,000 couples living in states that do not currently permit them to wed would get married in the next three years, the institute says. Roughly 1 million same-sex couples, married and unmarried, live together in the United States, the institute says.Via: AP News ",Government News,"Jun 26, 2015"
8198, Glenn Beck Anchor In Race Attack On Beyoncé For Super Bowl Show (VIDEO),"An anchor for Glenn Beck s TV network, The Blaze, is the latest right-wing media figure to attack Beyonc  for her Super Bowl halftime performance.Tomi Lahren, who hosts the show Tomi, used her program to berate Beyonc s work. Lahren, 23, argues that,  Your husband was a drug dealer. For fourteen years, he sold crack cocaine. Talk about protecting black neighborhoods? Start at home. https://youtu.be/cwVnDRx8EikThat is a reference to Beyonc s husband, rapper and rap mogul Jay Z. The strange bit is that Lahren is referring to behavior Jay Z engaged in when he was a teenager. He is now 46 years old, and has had a multi-decade career topping music charts, producing some of the biggest names in music, working in fashion and other industries. He is worth an estimated $520 million, and has sold over 100 million records and received 21 Grammy Awards.Lahren has inadvertently made a point about the racial injustice and prejudice Beyonc  was alluding to in her performance and in the song  Formation,  when she reduces Jay Z s life to his teenage mistakes   which he has been very open about in his work   and ignores his business success and philanthropy (he was part of a $1 million donation to rebuild New Orleans after Katrina, for instance).She joins other conservatives like former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani in attacking Beyonc s performance for having the nerve to bring up Hurricane Katrina, black pride, and police shootings of black civilians.The mindset being promoted by Lahren in this attack definitely fits in with former Fox News host Glenn Beck, who welcomed her to The Blaze  family  in October of last year after several of her right-wing video rants went viral.Beck, who is still heard on the radio after a cascade of dropped sponsors pushed Fox to cancel his show. Has a history of racially charged remarks. He said President Obama had a  deep-seated hatred of white people,  claimed progressives were pushing for a  race war,  promoted a book written by an anti-semite, and repeatedly claimed Obama was trying to enslave people.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 10, 2016"

22699,"Activists or Terrorists? How Media Controls and Dictates ‘The Narrative’ in Burns, Oregon","  Randy Johnson 21st Century WireThe majority of mainstream media reporting surrounding the Burns, Oregon, and Wildlife Refuge occupy protest has ranged from overly simplistic, to outright partisan. This story is a microcosm of media at its most divisive. At its core, the narrative has become reduced to the government versus the militia or the government versus the people depending on one s vantage point. On average, the mainstream media s most neutral narrative is as follows: Father-son duo of the Hammond ranching family started fires, were found guilty, went to jail, and a bunch of  militant  and  anti-government  militia men don t like what the federal government are doing and used the event to take over a federal building in the Malhuer Wildlife refuge. Further to the left, the narrative looks more like: Armed Anti-government gang takes over federal building   Oregon community in crisis  (exact words from one mainstream media news anchor)For most of the American media, that s a good enough explanation. If it fits your political template, then that is all good. Case closed ? Arizona rancher LaVoy Finicum sits watch overnight with media looking on (Image Credit: Capital Blue/AP Photo/Rebecca Boone)News media have become brand shopping. Do you want quality, fun, style, and value? Are you loyal to the name? Pick your poison. Reporting a story often times becomes the selling of a larger agenda, each agenda point with its own out-of-the-box marketing campaign and the corresponding planning that goes with it.The entire development, for major news networks, is much easier to navigate and is less confusing than constantly revising varying degrees of moderation and extremism between allegiance-switching groups in the Middle East.For a  case closed  perspective of the events from the Department of Justice, District of Oregon, after court rulings on the Hammonds in October of 2015, read here and stop.The first line of defense is to know that these events rarely, if ever, spawn up overnight and happen in isolation. For a review and thorough sequence of events, detailing how the situation has escalated to what it is now, read the following from 21WIRE, here.So is the media reporting events or peddling agendas? If they do both, maybe no one can tell the difference.Things are not that easy and navigating through mainstream news media sludge takes work. Certainly, the White House s gun-control marketing campaign this week has cast a convenient shadow over events in Oregon, and in order to force-in outside and unrelated issues, the matter at hand must be reduced to a quick and easy account by the media.One could maintain that Oregon s Malhuer Wildlife Refuge, the Hammonds, and militias have all become components for a guided tour on how to think. The reason for this is because any number of agendas and unrelated topics have been heaped upon the issue ranging from the Presidential race posturing, race itself, Islam, terrorism, gun control, and a host of distractive latch-on issues.Simplify MattersThe contrasting sides are often set-up, or at least alluded to, immediately. This is what public relations operatives and political consultants refer to as  framing . There are plenty of them working in media now, so don t be surprised to see the exact same tactic deployed in politics as is commonplace in today s  media  industry.In today s media barrage, the title alone might suffice. A quick internet search of various article titles on the subject frame everything at a glance:FBI Monitoring Armed Stand Off in Oregon National Wildlife RefugeArmed Group Takes Over Federal Building Following Protest In OregonOregon Armed Protest Leader Says Group Will Defend Occupied BuildingThe narrative is further presented as two sides with contrasting positions. Choose your position, and make your case. Most Americans will have been pre-conditioned to know where they are supposed to stand, and will quickly align accordingly. The framing here is usually a binary dialectic, or two sides only, with no grey area or middle ground. A or B, Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative, pro-government or anti-government, Jedi or Sith? We all know the drill. Here they are mainstream media style:The Hammonds: Victims of over-reach by a federal government, or rogue ranchers who are above the law with a fondness for starting fires?The Bundy s and outside militias: Lending a hand to fellow ranchers who are too over-matched to fight for themselves, or unwanted instigators on a personal anti-government crusade?The Bureau of Land Management: Caretakers and stewards of land and resources, or the very embodiment of big government imposing its will through a vantage point of official power and authority?Over-simplified, binary arguments almost never present real events. In reality, there are two or more sides to a story or event. This is what most media outlets do not want you to understand, and this is where the  art of the delivery  comes in, by steering the audience to the  right  choice.When reporting on the events in question in Oregon, the mainstream media imply, or outright allege, that protesters and the militia members who converged on the Malhuer Wildlife Refuge intend to draw first contact and start a shootout (as seen later in a CNN clip below). The analysis about a trigger-happy militia is pondered endlessly by mainstream news personalities, despite repeated statements to the contrary by organizers of the militias in question. This is followed by an endless string of pundits and experts expressing their righteous indignation that  the federal government can t let these militants get away with this! , and so on.Activists or Terrorists?Part of the process of  owning  the narrative and shaping public opinion is to define the problem and the people involved with quick and easily identifiable labels. Among other things, this allows the media to avoid doing any real investigation into the core issues, and simply surf the partisan waves.In Burns, Oregon, this never happened. Instead the media have labeled the Hammonds as  arsonists  and the Bundys as  terrorists .The mainstream media have worked diligently to characterize the protest s leader, Ammon Bundy (photo, left), son of now iconic Nevada rancher, Cliven Bundy, as an armed insurgent and a domestic terrorist. This is likely do to the fact that  journalists  are unfamiliar with the fact that Ammon Bundy has stepped into a political role as a public and state lands advocate since 2014   bringing attention to the thousands of ranchers and farmers in the southwestern states facing federal vs state land management issues, and has spoken publicly many times since the Bundy stand-off in 2014. Viewed through this prism, the Hammond protest and occupation of the Malhuer Wildlife Refuge is quite obviously a political event. But that s not how the media are treating this.Today saw one of the lowest points in partisan media. In one of the worst displays of mainstream gutter journalism, led by  Carli Brosseau from Oregon LIVE, who has attempted to senselessly slander the Bundys by digging through all the personal records and finances of the Bundy sons and other protesters, including their businesses loans, personal property records and even traffic violations   in a clear effort to try and slander them in public for matters not related at all to the public lands issue. If only the Oregon LIVE and CNN would apply that same level of effort to investigating the government s role in Hammond case, or for the thousands of other farmers who have been forcibly bankrupted and put out of business over the last two decades.What  guilt-by-association  words better fit today s on edge atmospherics than  terrorists and terrorism ? These are precisely the terms which media began saturating the internet with moments after this event hit the headlines. Various left-wing hashtag campaigns like #YallQaeda and #VanillaISIS were strewn all over Twitter and have been trending ever since. This has provided a soft cushion on which larger media  journalists  and organizations can comfortably bounce around pejorative terms without receiving too much criticism. Here s one choice example: See tweet here.Amazingly, even long-established news organizations, such as the Washington Post, have published articles which question why the militia are not called  terrorists , while Fox Radio ponders whether or not they are  patriots  or  terrorists .The drive for the pejorative label is in full effect. This comes as no surprise, as the mainstream media have been swimming in confusion the last few years, with ever-fluctuating moderation levels of jihadists based upon what group is being backed by the West or its allies at any given moment. However, calling an American citizen or group  terrorist  immediately defines where you stand with regards to protesters or members of the militia.CNN gets right after it, throws down the gauntlet, and calls the militias in question terrorists without hesitation. The video below is a typical example of agenda driven  news reporting  that brings in unrelated issues of race, the Muslim religion, and loosely slapping a terrorist label over what might best be described as breaking and entering. Through their presentation, the event itself slightly matters and the story becomes everything but the event. Instead of an analysis into how the situation evolved, time is spent on painting a good versus bad narrative, which is done simply by applying the terrorist label to the militias. Watch: In reality, the happy mediums between demands, law, authority, and obedience are more calculus, than single digit addition. In other words, it s complicated, and no one hates complications more than media and partisan politicians. Through polarizing the issue, drawing sides, and picking a righteous winner, CNN sides with its apparent partner in Washington and presents the story in such a manner. You can even hear the sadness in the voices as they discuss the possibility that the government might  wait out  the militia instead of coming in with aggressive force and establishing  who is boss.  It might behoove any good journalist or pundit to pause and ask: are the various militias in question really terrorists, and do their acts constitute terrorism?Here is the definition of  domestic terrorism  and the  federal crime of terrorism  as delineated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI):  Domestic terrorism  means activities with the following three characteristics:  Involve acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law;  Appear intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination. or kidnapping; and  Occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S.18 U.S.C. Sec 2332b defines the term  federal crime of terrorism  as an offense that:  Is calculated to influence or affect the conduct of government by intimidation or coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct; and  Is a violation of one of several listed statutes, including Sec 930(c) (relating to killing or attempted killing during an attack on a federal facility with a dangerous weapon); and Sec 1114 (relating to killing or attempted killing of officers and employees of the U.S.).Granted, America seems to be expanding this definition every year, as evidenced by the above inclusion of  retaliate against government conduct  on the list. This seems to indicate that any protest can be characterized as  terrorism  should the government chose to press there. Those calling these militias  terrorists , seem to be taking only  (ii)  from the above definition of Domestic Terrorism and are  running with it. Again, the FBI states in their own words above that the three characteristics are required. Nowhere does the FBI say, one of the above is terrorism, or some of the above is terrorism. As champions of the law and enforcing it, and assuming  care was taken to review the definitions by many, one would believe that they meant what they wrote and wrote what they meant. The militia is a citizen s right clearly stated in the US Constitution, but perhaps breaking and entering or  unlawfully  occupying is not legal . but terrorism?What about committing the  federal crime of terrorism  from 18 U.S.C. (United States Code) Sec 2332b above? Clearly, the militias are there, openly, with guns and stating they will defend themselves if necessary. Or, are they simply there and carrying fire arms within the law (yes, it is legal to carry a gun in the US)? The definition might appear to be in the eye of the beholder, but from the government s perspective, the definition seems highly elastic.CNN and the Washington Post are telling you whom to side with through their narrative and  terrorist  labels for the militias in question.Depending on how one views the world with regards to the issue, along with their ability to process information presented to them, determines what side they are on, or if they are even on a side. Who has the bigger agenda and the bigger stake, the government, or the militias and ranchers? Is it really about Land Management and/or People Management, or are both inter-related?Let s start with the land itself. As noted in the Congressional Research Service s 2014 document Federal Land Ownership, the United States governs, oversees, owns, or otherwise has authority and jurisdiction over land primarily through the following 5 agencies:The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) The Forestry Service (FS) The Fish and Wild Life Service (FWS) The National Park Service (NPS) The Department of Defense (DoD)Here is what Oregon looked like with regard to the above agencies and some of their sub-departments in 1996, now twenty years ago: Oregon Public Lands 1996. (Image: Wiki Commons)The Federal Land Ownership document, cited above, also notes that the overall public land managed by the BLM has dropped nearly 25 million acres from 1990 to 2013. However, this comes mostly from almost 22 million acres within Alaska alone. Within Oregon, the state in question, the BLM alone has gained almost 550,000 acres to manage from the already color-dense map above, and is set to takeover another 2.5 million acres with the their proposed Owyhee Canyonlands  National Monument    an area larger than Yellowstone National Park   set to be shut-off to the state and placed under BLM control.Part of the larger Department of the Interior (DOI), the Bureau of Land Management s (BLM) Mission Statement is:  To sustain the health, diversity, and productivity of America s public lands for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations.  According to the BLM website, they oversee more than 245 million acres and over 700 million mineral and  sub surface  acres, with a multi-billion dollar budget and about 10,000 employees. The BLM also claims to be one of the few federal agencies that generate revenue, based largely on 4.3 billion dollars of onshore oil and gas development and numerous other  land deals  brokered by the BLM.Hundreds of millions of acres is vast. Most people probably see the need for a diligent and upstanding management of it, to include the natural resources and wildlife found on the land, as well as the resources beneath it. Understanding that a  free for all  of destroying resources combined with a full bore resource grab would be adverse, many would likely contribute to the oversight of it. Being entrusted with such a job could be seen as an honorable undertaking   by citizens  for citizens. But when does stewardship and land management turn into  territorial control  by Washington DC, which invariably leads to an institutional vendetta, or  sending a message , or becomes a means to define boundaries between authorities and their subjects? Undoubtedly, this is what seems to be happening all over the western states, and with small farms being victims, picked off, one by one by a superior force   the federal government.So the federal government in Washington DC is treating State public land as its  territory , when, according to the US Constitution, it is not.Watch as Oregon Congressman Greg Walden (R) delivers an incredibly detailed and impassioned speech on the Capitol floor yesterday, outlining the scale of this problem in his state: Many Constitutional purists and opponents of federal government  over reach  and abuse of power argue that the government doesn t really own the land. By both the letter, and spirit of the law, there is a real Constitutional case to be made there. Unfortunately, it all quickly turns into a debate on power, control, and authority between the federal government and the states, further complicated by who happens to be in positions of authority for each.They point to Article I, Section 8, of the United States Constitution which authorizes Congress to  exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-yards, and other needful Buildings,  and they throw out the very premise of government land ownership outside of those parameters. The larger issue, beyond the Hammond family in particular, is also centered around jurisdiction   literally. Jurisdiction over land and resources inevitably stem from arrangements involving ownership and control. Who is in charge of what, and to what degree? Whose goals are ultimately being achieved and who is affected are things all citizens would be wise to ask themselves.Are the Hammonds being crushed from above in accordance to what they did and were found guilty of and does the punishment fit?The Oregonian reports: There s nobody in history who has gone to federal prison for burning a few acres of public property,  said Melodi Molt, a Harney County rancher and former president of Oregon CattleWomen.  It s not right.  The Oregon Farm Bureau said the second prison term is  gross government overreach and the public should be outraged.  And then there is what some locals see as a government land grab. The Hammonds in late 2014 agreed to pay the federal government $400,000 to settle a lawsuit seeking to force them to pay more than a $1 million in costs for fighting fires they set. The Hammonds paid $200,000 right away and paid the rest Thursday.  The settlement also required the Hammonds to give the land bureau first chance at buying a particular ranch parcel adjacent to public land if they intended to sell. For some, this was evidence that the government all along was after the Hammond ground to add to its Steens Mountain holdings. The Oregonian continues, stating that the Hammonds originally served jail time starting in 2012 under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). The father, Dwight Hammond, aged 73, was sentenced to three months and the son, Steve, to one year. A possible 5 year sentence, according to U.S. District Judge Michael Hogan at the Hammonds  original 2012 sentencing, would be unconstitutional and  a sentence which would shock the conscience.  After serving their time, both father and son were dragged back in front of a federal bench and re-sentenced to a full 5 year term   in what many believe was just the latest chapter in a federal vendetta against the family, waged in part by then U.S Attorney for the State of Oregon, Amanda Marshall.A New Yorker article unabashedly calls the AEDPA law,   one of the worst statutes ever passed by Congress [headed by Bob Dole] and signed into law by a President [President Clinton]. The heart of the law is a provision saying that, even when a state court misapplies the Constitution, a defendant cannot necessarily have his day in federal court. So is this the new image of a terrorist breeding ground and rallying point?  (Image: Oregon Live/The Oregonian)  Wild Cards and Other SubterfugeTo be fair, not everyone is happy about the outsiders. Caught in the midst of it all are citizens such as a local resident, Candy Tiller, quoted by Oregon Public Broadcasting, saying,  I m worried that there s a trigger-happy idiot out there  And maybe a law enforcement officer or somebody else makes a move that makes him think they re pulling a gun and he s going to shoot  I don t want that. I don t want that for anybody  This is crazy. This does not fit. These people need to go away.  Locals will always feel the tension best, and no scenario would play to the establishment and mainstream media narrative better than an Waco-style gunfight and siege, also playing out on LIVE television. Based on the current situation report, the federal government would be the one escalating tension by pouring hundreds of assets into the small town and turning the area into a quasi-military occupation, as Washington clearly did with Bundy Ranch in 2014.Whether it s a Greenpeace protest, Occupy Wall Street, or Bundy Ranch, federal agencies have tried and tested methods besides overt force, in order to weaken and ultimately bring down any protest. The first method is disinformation   a  protest leak  about a  split  within the group, or  rumors  about a member of the group wanting to leave. This type of manuever might look something like this: See the tweet here.Next is the  Dirty Tricks  phase, where a third party leaks personal information of the protesters to the mainstream media, in order discredit the protesters and help to break up the group.The other method of disinformation is a  government insider leak  designed to scare off other activists from coming to the event, but also to jar those inside of the protest and their families and as loved ones look on. Whether it is true or not is beside the point. This type of sensational storyline is designed make its way on to the internet and quickly go viral, and might look something like this: FBI preparing for Waco-style raid in Oregon Similarly, during the Bundy Ranch standoff in 2014, a slightly more outlandish story was planted in the alternative media about Eric Holder authorizing a drone strike on Bundy Ranch. Not surprisingly, the story was complete fiction. As wildly unbelievable as that story was, it worked incredibly well for the federal government because the bulk of the militia camped out at the ranch, a group known as Oathkeepers, immediately became frightened, packed up and left.Oathkeepers appear to have released another similar  insider leak  story last week for the Oregon Standoff, about the Pentagon deploying  Delta Force  to take back the Wildlife Refuge, which can be found here.Another example could be found in a Tweet released at the height of the Bundy Ranch stand-off in 2014, claiming that the government had shut down cell phone towers in a  communications black-out  (presumably  preparing to attack ). Though this never actually happened, one could easily view this as an attempt to scare away members of the public from going to the ranch to support the cause:Bundy family reports cell towers near ranch have been shut down, preventing communication & video uploads. #BundyRanch  Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) April 11, 2014If the disinformation fails, the next level of federal subterfuge is usually to embed or  plant  a federal informant(s) or agent provocateur (s) inside of the protest. Typically, this is done very early on in the process, but also becomes much easier once more people pour into the area. With a  patriots unite  call to stand with the militias, as seen in the below video, it s almost impossible for organizers to ever know who could be on-site, or what off-centered  rebel  or individual would simply  just show up , either to make a name for themselves through media coverage, or even worse   by starting some serious trouble between activists or with law enforcement.In terms of discrediting the protest in the court of public opinion, the Hammond Protest could field no one better than tabloid media mascot, like Jon Ritzheimer of Anti-Islam protesting fame.  Ritzheimer quickly become the mainstream media s target of ridicule and used to discredit any of the other protesters. In addition to his armed march on American mosques, Ritzheimer also tried to grab headlines for traveling to Michigan to kidnap, or make a  citizens arrest  as Ritzheimer called it, of the elderly Senator Debbie Stabenow (D)   because she supported the international Iran Nuclear Deal.Here is Ritzheimer recording his own  martyrdom-style video  before heading into the protest: Whether this is by design, or not, the effect is undeniable. This exact scenario has already played out in Burns, Oregon with the mainstream media casting Ritzheimer in the role of flag-waving xenophobe and  militia nut-job , with the added knock-on effect of painting  constitutionalists  as mentally unstable,  militant extremists.  PHOTO: Professional media villain and provocateur Jon Ritzheimer.Another prominent militia personality at the Oregon protest is Blaine Cooper (also known as Stanley Blaine Hicks). Like Ritzheimer, he also acts as a media lightning rod   due to his similar performance in a YouTube video where he rubs bacon on a copy of the Koran before burning and shooting arrows in to it, before calling it,  the most evil, pathetic book on the face of the planet.  Unfortunately, these media distractions only divert the public from real issues being raised by the Hammonds and the Bundys and will ultimately be used to discredit their land rights cause.Once again, more  Patriot Games. As the event unfolds many scenarios could happen. The worst outcome of events in Oregon would be that the Hammond family issue loses the spotlight, and the public lands issue becomes obscured by a media desperate for a anti-gun narrative and obsessed with the ridiculous antics of synthetic YouTube actors attached to event.Only the craziest of megalomaniac government officials, robotic plants, or glory-seeking wackos would really want this to escalate, led by a depraved sensationalized media, and with a public glued to the screen  Farenheit 451 style  with a bag of Cheetos.READ MORE HAMMOND RANCH NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Hammond Ranch",US_News,"January 7, 2016"
8020, Jeb Bush Rally Becomes Counseling Session As Supporters Give Him Advice To Fix His Struggling Campaign,"A desperate Jeb Bush held a campaign rally at a South Carolina golf course on Wednesday, and all his supporters wanted to do was give him advice on how to fix his struggling campaign.Bush was probably hoping to come out swinging as the South Carolina primary approaches, but his worried fans had different concerns.Like a child being advised on how to deal with being bullied, one Bush supporter named Edward Scott told Bush that he should  raise the bar  and rise above the bullying by Trump because his message is being lost the more Bush gets frazzled by the billionaire mogul. Your message doesn t resonate with the national community.   I was wondering because of your civility if you could raise the bar in the next session and try to be beyond the bully because I think that s who you are and I think they try to knock you off center. It appears you do get knocked off center, like anyone would, because of the insults to your family. I don t think I feel shaken up by the bully,  Bush replied.  I m the only guy going after the guy who I believe is hijacking the party. David Villinger also voiced concern about Trump taking over the race while Bush desperately focuses on attacking him instead of focusing on delivering his own message. I think the campaign has been co-opted by the P.T. Barnum of our time. And I think he is getting you off your good message and all the times that you ve shared with us today. But I think I would encourage you to emphasize those things. Indeed, Jeb Bush is currently polling in a distant fourth place behind Trump, who leads the field with 34 percent while Bush only has under 10 percent.Cruz clocks in at second place with 17 percent and Rubio is a close third place with 16 percent. Clearly, nobody is really all that excited about Jeb.In the end, Jeb Bush not only received advice, he got bad news because South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley endorsed Marco Rubio even after Jeb sent his brother to meet with her. Jeb could only give reporters some parting sarcasm. It s all been decided, apparently. The pundits have already figured it out. We don t have to go vote. I should stop campaigning maybe. And that s probably the best idea Jeb Bush has had throughout his entire campaign. Featured image from Flickr",News,"February 18, 2016"
3704, High-Ranking Democrat DEMANDS Investigation Into Open Corruption At Trump Foundation,"Recently, news broke that the Trump Foundation openly and blatantly broke IRS corruption rules about self-dealing. In a tax filing obtained by a watchdog group and reported on by the Washington Post, Trump s charity admits to self-dealing both recently and in past years.It s very likely Trump intends to use the powers of the presidency to enrich himself personally, and he s said as much himself.So it should come as no surprise to him that Democratic members of Congress are demanding an investigation and further paperwork related to this scandal. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), a Ranking Member in the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, released a letter demanding additional documentation concerning the admitted self-dealing occurring at the Trump foundation. The letter reads, in part,I am writing to request additional information on the apparent admission of the Donald J. Trump Foundation to multiple instances in which the organization appears to have violated the legal prohibition against using charitable funds to benefit its leaders, their family members, or other disqualified individuals   commonly known as  self-dealing. According to press reports, the Foundation spent more than a quarter-million dollars of charitable funds to settle various lawsuits involving the President-elect s for-profit companies.The Foundation also reportedly used $20,000 of charitable funds to purchase a six-foot tall portrait of the President-elect, and at the time the Foundation was predominately funded by other donors.The Foundation also previously paid a 10% excise tax to the IRS for reportedly providing an illegal $25,000 political contribution to the campaign of Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi. At the time, Ms. Bondi was considering whether to investigate allegations of fraud against Trump University and decided not to pursue the case after receiving the contribution.You can read the letter in its entirely here (PDF).This doesn t paint a pretty picture. It s clear that Donald Trump believes he is above the law, and that s before he was elected president. It s up to all of us to hold him accountable for his actions by supporting the leaders calling him out for his corruption and sticking up for the American people.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"November 22, 2016"
21738,LET THE REPARATIONS BEGIN: Rahm Emanuel Uses $5.5 Million Taxpayer Dollars To Gain Favor With Chicago’s Black Voters," We do this not because it s legally required, because it s not,  Patton said at a hearing on the agreement.  We do this because we believe it s the right thing to do, both for the victims and their families and for the city. This is historic,  said Mr. Coverson.  The only city in America that has given reparations and passed a reparations ordinance, and given an official apology for the violence that the police have done to citizens. The city of Chicago on Tuesday sought to put to rest one of its most persistent scandals, proposing a $5.5 million reparations fund for dozens of torture victims connected to former Chicago police Cmdr. Jon Burge and his so-called midnight crew of rogue detectives.The proposal, negotiated with a key plaintiff s attorney and supported by Mayor Rahm Emanuel, would offer free city college tuition for victims and their families, free counseling for psychological issues and substance abuse as well as other assistance to more than 50 potential victims. The city would also issue a formal apology, create a permanent memorial recognizing the victims and ensure that eighth- and 10th-grade students attending Chicago Public Schools would be taught about the Burge case and its brutal legacy, cementing the scandal s role in city history.But as much as the proposal seeks to end a painful, controversial era   Emanuel said it would  close this book, the Burge book on the city s history    it is unlikely to stanch the flow of torture claims from victims. A Loyola University Chicago law school dean appointed by a Cook County judge has identified some 20 additional cases in which inmates may have been Burge victims. Other inmates who have made torture claims continue to fight to overturn convictions and win their freedom. And one lawsuit over the torture is pending.Already, this stubborn scandal has cost taxpayers about $100 million in lawsuit settlements, judgments and other legal costs, according to lawyers. It brings it much closer to closure, especially from the city s point of view,  said Flint Taylor, an attorney who has been pursuing the torture issue for decades and was one of the lawyers who negotiated the reparations package.  But it s not done and over.

He still collects a police pension.Burge did not return calls Tuesday to his home in Florida.But John  Jack  Byrne, Burge s former right-hand man, on Tuesday called the reparations deal a  scam perpetuated on taxpayers.

6434, GOP Anti-Trumpers Have A Hail Mary Idea To Stop Trump That Just Might Work,"As Donald Trump makes the downhill run to Cleveland this July, those loyal to the Republican party who see it as a viable political entity for the next century rather than the cesspool of racism, hypocrisy and hate run by the wealthy that it is are trying desperately to save their beloved sham. America is divided. Politically we are either in favor of progress and societal evolution or we re with the rich guys who couldn t care less, but all life matters and poor people are stealing your paycheck.It really is that simple. You don t hear about plans to save and revive the Democratic party; our numbers grow as people learn to read and use Google. How many times can a person with any intelligence land back on a  pants on fire  designation for yet another conservative  news  crock of sh*t before they figure out the GOP is a scam?? Anyway, those people who are tried and true Republicans who know that Donald Trump is about to be the laughing-stock of the nation when actual debate issues come up and the Republican party will pay dearly.As he alienates more and more groups of people, trying desperately to get elected exclusively by angry white males, the establishment Republicans charged with seeing their party into the future can t endorse it. Mitt Romney and Ben Sasse are kicking around the idea of a third-party run, not by them of course, but the inevitable result of splitting the conservative vote is a Clinton win. It looks like the inevitable result of a straight Trump versus Clinton matchup ends with a Clinton win as well, so those still interested in seeing anyone but Donald Trump represent the Republican party in November are beginning to think of longshot last plays. The #NeverTrump movement has come up with one, and if properly put into place, it could change electoral history.In order for someone to win the White House, they must receive 270 electoral votes. Democrats have a distinct lead in electoral votes before polling begins, so the GOP always faces an uphill battle to begin with. If you want to see a third-party candidate in the White House you don t have to run one in the election, you just have to make sure neither of the candidates from the major party gets to 270. What happens then? According to the Constitution, the House of Representatives will then appoint Paul Ryan or Mittens or Jeb Bush or whoever else they feel works best for their political agenda, by a simple majority vote.So how do you keep the candidates from getting enough electoral votes? The idea from #NeverTrump is simple enough in theory: Run an influential person in each state and only in that state. Take enough electoral votes that way and nobody gets to 270. Think about it What if enough people in Florida decided that they would vote for Jeb Bush because neither of the major party candidates appealed to them. They know Jeb; they trust him. If he s on the ticket there s a darned good reason. In 2000 that by itself would have sent the presidential election to a vote, not restricted to the candidates on the ballot, in the congressional lower chamber. If that happens this year, Speaker Ryan will get to appoint his first president.The #NeverTrump movement is more than likely futile because in the end the Republicans are gonna batten down the hatches and ride the Trump wave all the way to historical comedy.Featured image by Matt Mills McKnight/Getty Images",News,"May 11, 2016"
9442,JUST IN: Anti-Putin Banker Claims Firm Tied To Clinton Campaign Assisted Russians In Effort ‘To Have Me Imprisoned And Killed’,"One of the many targets of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS is accusing them of assisting the Kremlin in its effort to have him  imprisoned and killed. The strong allegation comes from Bill Browder, a London-based banker who spearheaded the Magnitsky Act, a sanctions law vehemently opposed by the Russian government.Browder made the allegation in response to the recent revelation that Fusion GPS and its founder Glenn Simpson compiled what he says is false information about him that was given to Yuri Chaika, Russia s prosecutor general, and to Donald Trump Jr. during the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting. If it is true that Glenn Simpson was supplying information about me to the Russian government, it s far more serious than smear campaigning or Foreign Agents Registration Act violations,  said Browder, the head of Hermitage Capital. It would mean that Simpson was assisting the Putin regime in their plot to get me back to Russia to have me imprisoned and killed.It was previously known that the Washington, D.C-based Fusion GPS s investigation of Browder was beneficial to the Russian government and its effort to reverse the Magnitsky Act. But it was revealed only last week that information Fusion collected on Browder was shared directly with Chaika, whose position is the Russian equivalent of the U.S. attorney general.Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian attorney who attended the Trump Tower meeting, is who provided both Chaika and Trump Jr. with the Fusion-generated information on Browder. She took a four-page report into the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower meeting, which was attended by Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort.Veselnitskaya worked with Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, on the anti-Browder project. Reuters reported on Thursday that Simpson compiled the research for the Trump Tower memo. And NBC News reported on Friday that similar research put together by Simpson was given by Veselnitskaya to Chaika in Oct. 2015.Browder, who was born in Chicago but is a British citizen, is a target of the Kremlin s ire because of his role in pushing through the Magnitsky Act, which passed Congress in 2012. The Russian government recently issued an Interpol arrest in an attempt to apprehend Browder. Vladimir Putin reportedly approved the move against the 53-year-old money manager, who wrote a book about his travails called  Red Notice,  a reference to the term used for Interpol warrants.Fusion GPS, which is based in Washington, D.C., became involved in the Browder matter after being hired by BakerHostetler, a law firm representing Denis Katsyv, a Russian businessman who faced penalties because of the Magnitsky Act.Simpson worked closely on the investigation with the Moscow-based Veselnitskaya, who represents Katsyv and his firm, Prevezon Holdings.Veselnitskaya s affiliation with Simpson is one of the stranger story lines arising from both the Trump Tower meeting and the dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and DNC.Theories have circulated that Fusion GPS arranged the Trump Tower meeting in order to compromise the Trump campaign or that Simpson relayed details of the meeting provided by Veselnitskaya to Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote the dossier.Fusion was being paid for its dossier work at the same time it was being paid by BakerHostetler to investigate Browder.Adding even more fuel to those theories was a report this week that Simpson and Veselnitskaya met just before and just after she attended the Trump Tower session:BUSTED! MEETING BETWEEN FUSION GPS AND RUSSIAN LAWYER BEFORE AND AFTER:The co-founder of Fusion GPS, the firm behind the unverified Trump dossier, met with a Russian lawyer before and after a key meeting she had last year with Trump Jr. The contacts shed new light on how closely tied the firm was to Russian interests, at a time when it was financing research to discredit then-candidate Donald Trump.The opposition research firm has faced renewed scrutiny after litigation revealed that the DNC and Hillary Clinton s campaign paid for that research. Congressional Republicans have since questioned whether that politically financed research contributed to the FBI s investigation of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign   making Fusion s 2016 contacts with Russian interests all the more relevant.DNC MONEY FUNNELED THROUGH LAW FIRM TO FUSION GPS?The June 2016 Trump Tower meeting involving Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya occurred during a critical period. Bank records show Fusion GPS was paid by a law firm for work on behalf of a Kremlin-linked oligarch while paying a former British spy Christopher Steele to dig up dirt on Trump through his Russian contacts.But hours before the Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016, Fusion co-founder and ex-Wall Street Journal reporter Glenn Simpson was with Veselnitskaya in a Manhattan federal courtroom. Court records show email correspondence and published reports corroborate the pair s presence together. They also were together after the Trump Tower meeting.Read more: Fox NewsRead more: Daily Caller",politics,"Nov 13, 2017"

This allows me to take a stand on controversial issues: In fact, it obliges me to do so because others cannot.  -George SorosMORE and OBS, two groups funded by George Soros, advertised money available for people willing to travel to protest (@organizemo is the twitter account of MORE): Listen to radical socialist George Soros talk about his innocuous <sarcasm> and oh so  transparent  little organization here:George Soros gives billions to left-wing causes: Soros started the Open Society Institute in 1993 as a way to spread his wealth to progressive causes. Using Open Society as a conduit, Soros has given more than $7 billion to a who s who of left-wing groups. This partial list of recipients of Soros  money says it all:ACORN, Apollo Alliance, National Council of La Raza, Tides Foundation, Huffington Post, Southern Poverty Law Center, Soujourners, People for the American Way, Planned Parenthood, and the National Organization for Women.George Soros wants to curtail American sovereignty: Soros would like nothing better than for America to become subservient to international bodies. He wants more power for groups such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, even while saying the U.S. role in the IMF should be  downsized.  In 1998, he wrote:  Insofar as there are collective interests that transcend state boundaries, the sovereignty of states must be subordinated to international law and international institutions. After protesters protested not getting their checks from MORE on May 14th, MORE allegedly distributed the following list as to who was paid to protest in Ferguson and elsewhere, to show where the money had been going.Obviously, as we ve mentioned before, this is far from a  grass roots spontaneous  protest.You can see money paid out to Lisa Fithian, $1,127.75 for  visit expenses .For those who do not know, Lisa Fithian is an infamous leftist organizer. She organized at Occupy, but has been used as a training organizer for many years before that. She spent time in Ferguson in 2014 training people to  simulate chaos. Is it possible that George Soros has a love affair with Lisa Fithian because of their common hatred for Israel?Also of note, you can see that some people are being paid to travel to other places to protest, you can see the travel to Selma, and to D.C., as well as money paid out for  vans , including to a union for providing the vans. Elizabeth Vega got $2000 for  activist trip to Baltimore .There is money paid for protester supplies and protester catering, as well as for video recording of the protests. Some things were not so defined such as $2000 to Taylor Payne for  support .$52,815 is paid to MORE. Money clearly was to go through them to the protesters, according to the protesters during their #Cuthtechecks protest.There are big payouts to Jeff Ordower. Jeff Ordower is a bit like a male Lisa Fithian, he was an organizer for the SEIU and ACORN. He founded MORE and his stated goal is  welcoming co-conspirators in attempts to scale up numbers of radical organizers who can financially support themselves in the work . He is the white man protesters are complaining to in this clip, when they protested not getting paid.

23326,Father of Orlando Shooter is Long-time CIA Asset,"SEE ALSO: ORLANDO  KNOWN WOLF  Watched by FBI, Worked with DHS, Amid Crisis Actors, Drills & CI s21st Century Wire says The Orlando Shooting. Many things are just not right with this story, including the father of the alleged shooter Omar Mateen, an Afghan-American, Seddique Mateen, who is closely linked to some of the most powerful leaders and agencies in Washington DC.Below is a photo of Omar s father after a meeting at the US State Dept. in Washington DC where he met with  officials , but oddly, no log of his visit is available in the public record. Image Credit: facebook.com/seddique.mateenThe alleged shooter s father played an absolute key role in setting up the entire  hate crime  narrative by inserting this quote into the MSM machine during the immediate aftermath of the sensationalized media event. Seddique Mateen said: We were in Downtown Miami, Bayside, people were playing music, and he saw two men kissing each other in front of his wife and kid and he got very angry. They were kissing each other and touching each other and he said,  Look at that. In front of my son they are doing that.  And they we were in the men s bathroom and men were kissing each other. For the media, and every other political leader in the US, this was now classified as a  hate crime , and so  case closed. In other words, a simple story line with real traction was now baked firmly into this event   about a homophobic,  ISIS-inspired,  crazed  lone gunman  who  went postal  in a Orlando gay nightclub, and coincidentally, on the eve of an international Gay Pride celebration day.Pictured below is Seddique Mateen with California Republican Congressman Dana Rohrabacher. Rohrabacher (R-CA) was initially elected to Congress in 1988, with the fundraising help of friend Oliver North.Rohrabacher s decades-long involvement in  all things Afghan  eventually earned him the nickname  Gunga Dana.  Today he chairs the United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia and Emerging Threats.This morning President Obama called him a  home-grown  terrorist.  In a series of phone interviews Monday morning, Donald Trump responded that  there s something going on  with the President s  reaction to the Orlando shooting.I guess even a stopped clock is right twice a day. It s like calling Blackwater XE Orlando shooter Omar Mateen s father said  his son was not motivated by Islamist radical ideology, but in a Facebook video posted early Monday he said,  God himself will punish those involved in homosexuality. My own suspicion was first awakened on Monday morning when U.S. news outlets uniformly reported that the father s TV show aired on a   U.S.-based Afghan satellite channel.  That sort of circumlocution is typical when something is being hidden which the corporate media prefers we not ask questions about.The name of the nameless Afghan satellite channel, Payam Afghan, is said to be widely-known in Southwest Asia as a CIA-Pakistani ISI construct, as this picture from Flicker shows.The identification of shooter Omar Mateen also involved deception. He was said to work for a security company called G4S, which few have ever heard of. However,  G4S  is merely a re-branded  Wackenhut Corporation,  a name with a storied reputation for scandal in the U.S. and around the world.Rohrabacher has stated that he sees radical Islam as the source of a major terrorist threat to the U.S.Calls to his office today to request comment on whether he views CIA assets relocated in the U.S. as a terrorist threat have not been returned.SEE FULL REPORT: ORLANDO  KNOWN WOLF  Watched by FBI, Worked with DHS, Amid Crisis Actors, Drills & CI sHelp support us by becoming a 21WIRE Member at: 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"June 15, 2016"
15672,UPDATE: JUDGE REJECTS STATE DEPARTMENT PUSH FOR JANUARY 2016 RELEASE OF CLINTON E-MAILS," A federal judge REJECTED the State Department s request of a JANUARY 2016 (right before the IOWA primary) release of Hillary Clinton s e-mails in one big batch.  U.S. District Court Judge Rudolph Contreras (Obama appointee) announced Tuesday his plans to order a  rolling production  of the emails just hours after the State Department proposed that it not be required to make the records public until January 2016, a lawyer involved said.ORIGINAL POST:In response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed this year, the State Department said that reviewing 55,000 pages of exchanges from Mrs. Clinton s private email account would be labor-intensive and time-consuming.Noting the considerable public interest in the emails, the department  is endeavoring to complete the review and production of them as expeditiously as possible,  said John F. Hackett, acting director of the Office of Information Programs and Services at the State Department.  The collection is, however, voluminous and, due to the breadth of topics, the nature of the communications, and the interests of several agencies, presents several challenges. The State Department is proposing a date of Jan. 15, 2016, for releasing the emails.The department is dividing the material into small batches, with plans to review about 1,000 emails a week. In addition to the State Department s Freedom of Information Act office, subject-matter experts within the department will review the emails before their release, as will other government agencies when relevant, including the Defense Department, the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council. Currently, this project is staffed full time by a project manager and two case analysts, as well as nine FOIA reviewers who devote the entirety of their time at the State Department to this effort, plus other analysts and information technology specialists who provide collateral assistance to this review in addition to their regular duties,  the filing stated.  The team managing this project has met daily since early April to implement and oversee this large undertaking. Read more: PoliticoRead more: NYT",politics,"May 19, 2015"
9530,VIOLENT ENVIRONMENTAL LUNATICS Cost Taxpayers MILLIONS To Protect Trump’s EPA Director After Receiving “Unprecedented” Number of Credible Death Threats,"Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt has received an unprecedented amount of death threats, requiring a 24-hour security detail, according to an editorial published in the Wall Street Journal.The paper revealed the EPA has received more than 70  credible threats against EPA staffers, with a disproportionate number menacing Administrator Scott Pruitt and his family,  since President Donald Trump took office.Credible threats from liberal opponents have resulted in the EPA s inspector general s office recommending 24/7 security detail for Pruitt, which is costing taxpayers $2 million per year. Mr. Pruitt has received more than five times as many threats as his predecessor, Gina McCarthy,  the editorial explained.  These include explicit death threats. Some have referenced Mr. Pruitt s home address. Federal law enforcement has determined that some of those threatening Mr. Pruitt are likely capable of carrying out acts of violence. Democratic lawmakers have complained that the security detail is a waste of money, claiming  there is no apparent security threat against the administrator to justify such a security detail or expenditures. EPA security has already caught suspects prowling around the Administrator s neighborhood,  the Journal reported.Liberals have justified the death threats. Last week, a San Francisco columnist argued death threats against Pruitt were justified because he is a  banally evil, milquetoast, science-denying government administrator.  The death threats  make a warped sort of sense,  wrote liberal columnist Mark Morford. Mr. Pruitt didn t invent these threats, and Cabinet members shouldn t have to fear violence as a price of public service,  the WSJ editorial board said.For entire story: WFB",politics,"Nov 2, 2017"
10861,DETECTIVE ON SETH RICH Murder Mystery Drops Shocking News [Video],"Rod Wheeler was on Hannity last night with startling information on the Seth Rich murder mystery. He spoke about the mystery of why they can t locate the computer Rich used. They went on to discuss clues in the case that point to collusion between the DC police and the DNC. The most shocking information comes at the 4:20 mark when Wheeler says this:Rod Wheeler:  Here s one other thing that is going to be startling I m just gonna say this right now. I reached out to the police department way back in March when the family first hired me right..to get involved. I didn t hear anything from the police department for 2-3 days.Guess what I learned yesterday from the family of Seth Rich? The police department did not call me back because someone, a high ranking official at the DNC check this out a high ranking official at the DNC when I called the police department, they got that information and called the Rich family wanting to know, why was I snooping around? The plot thickens in this case. Will we finally find the murderer of this young man and who is behind it?IN CASE YOU HAVEN T SEEN UPDATES ON THIS CASE:CONFIRMED BOMBSHELL: SETH RICH Sent Over 44,000 DNC Emails To Journalist, Best Friend Of Wikileaks Founder DC Police Officer Claims They Were Told To  Stand Down  On Case [VIDEO]Wow! The private investigator hired by the Rich family to look into the death of 27-year old murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich just revealed some stunning evidence. It s been confirmed that over 44,000 emails and over 17,000 attachments were sent to the now deceased investigative journalist and best friend of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Now that this new information has been made available to the public, will the media be asking Hillary or the DNC any questions about their involvement in Rich s death? Will the DOJ be opening an investigation into his death in light of this new stunning evidence? What about the alleged Russian hack of the DNC emails that the media tried to tie to President Trump?Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich s death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich s laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death.Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation. The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,  said Wheeler.  They haven t been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both. When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said,  Absolutely. Yeah. That s confirmed. Wheeler also told us,  I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said,  Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can t share any information with you.  Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don t think it comes from the chief s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor s office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].The Democratic National Committee staffer who was gunned down on July 10 on a Washington, D.C., street just steps from his home had leaked thousands of internal emails to WikiLeaks, law enforcement sources told Fox News.A federal investigator who reviewed an FBI forensic report detailing the contents of DNC staffer Seth Rich s computer generated within 96 hours after his murder, said Rich made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time.  FOX5DCHere is the tweet announcing the death of Gavin MacFayden only weeks before the U.S. presidential election:Gavin Macfadyen was mentor to Assange (and his closest friend in London), to WikiLeaks' Sarah Harrison, Joseph Farrell and many others.  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 23, 2016 I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,  the federal investigator told Fox News, confirming the MacFadyen connection. He said the emails are in possession of the FBI, while the stalled case is in the hands of the Washington Police Department.The revelation is consistent with the findings of Rod Wheeler, a former DC homicide detective and Fox News contributor and whose private investigation firm was hired by Rich s family to probe the case. Rich was shot from behind in the wee hours, but was not robbed. My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,  Wheeler said.  I do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters. The federal investigator, who requested anonymity, said 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments between Democratic National Committee leaders, spanning from January 2015 through late May 2016, were transferred from Rich to MacFadyen before May 21.   FOX NewsWe reported on this story extensively. Here are some of our stunning findings over the past 10 months. It s pretty stunning that it took so long to find out about the e-mails on Rich s laptop: Conspiracy theories have been surrounding the murder of Seth Rich. They reached a new frenzy after the hacking of DNC e-mails led to the resignation of its chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.Rich was beaten, shot and killed early on the morning of July 8 while he was walking home and talking on the phone to his girlfriend. Police have said they haven t determined if his murder was a botched robbery or something else. The killer or killers appear to have taken nothing from their victim, leaving behind his wallet, watch and phone.Wikileaks just confirmed murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was the source of the DNC leak.Wikileaks released a series direct messages from US alleged  Russian spy  Guccifer 2.0 to actress model Robbin Young (according to Young).In the stream of texts the discussion leads to the DNC leaker.His name is  Seth ** In November Julian Assange said Russia did not hack into the DNC servers. -h/t GP Here s the proof:Direct Messages from U.S. alleged Russian spy @GUCCIFER_2 to actress-model @robbin_young (according to the latter) https://t.co/uMsB9WgxRQ  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) April 8, 2017Actress Robbin Young claims she had given this information she received from Guccifer 2.0 to the authorities but,  no one cared :https://twitter.com/Robbin_Young/status/850743524953702404Actress Robbin Young states that Guccifer 2.0 told her,  i m eager to find facts about seth, i m sure it wasn t just a robbery. seth was assassinated. :Guccifer 2.0 said, ""i'm eager to find fact about seth, i'm sure it wasn't just a robbery. seth was assassinated."" #SethRich  Robbin Young (@Robbin_Young) March 29, 2017In June 2016,the hacker Guccifer 2.0 claimed responsibility for breaking into the Democratic National Committee s servers, lifting opposition research the DNC had gathered, including a 200-page document focused on presumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.The hacker s moniker is an homage to  Guccifer,  the nom de guerre of Romanian hacker Marcel Lazar who claimed a previous hack into Hillary Clinton s private email server and is now awaiting prosecution for cybercrimes.  RTWhile Wikileaks  Julian Assange was being interviewed by John Pilger, he brought up the death of Seth Rich. Watch Assange s strange and somewhat cagey reply.Here is part of the conversation:Julian Assange: Whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant risks. As a 27 year-old, works for the DNC, was shot in the back, murdered just a few weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in Washington.Reporter: That was just a robbery, I believe. Wasn t it?Julian Assange: No. There s no finding. So  I m suggesting that our sources take risks.Watch it again in slow motion below:Seth Rich s parents explain what happened only moments before his death. He was the Voter Expansion Data Director for the DNC. His parents say he was,  Making sure everyone who wanted to vote, had the opportunity :Shortly after the killing, Redditors and social media users were pursuing a  lead  saying that Rich was en route to the FBI that fateful morning, apparently intending to speak to special agents about an  ongoing court case  possibly involving the Clinton family.More recently, Wikileaks s thousands of DNC emails and voice mails have piqued Reddit s interest, with Redditors combing through years of communications looking for any clue to Rich s murder.The theory is apparently based on Julian Assange s recent ITV appearance, where he scoffed at the idea that Russian hackers could be responsible for the data dump, and said that  anyone  within the Democrats  organization could easily have sent Wikileaks the offending messages.Given that Rich as a DNC staffer presumably would have had some access to its servers, Reddit is absolutely positive Rich paid the ultimate price for exposing Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC s crusade against Bernie Sanders.

5215, Four-Year-Old Bursts Into Tears When She Learns Obama Is Leaving Office (VIDEO),"A few months ago, a story of a young African-American girl went viral on social media. The girl is a first grader named Kameria. She was devastated that President Obama would soon be leaving office and her tears appeared all over social media. Kameria isn t the only one. Another little girl s tears are going viral as she whimpers that she  will miss Obama. Abella Tomlin of Beaverton, Oregon, was in the backseat of her car and her mother was listening to the Democratic National Convention. Obama s the only president this four-year-old has ever known, but this was the first time she had to face the hard reality of term limits.The video starts off with Abella seeming to cry over whatever four-year-olds cry over. She asked her mother Andrea if she could watch a movie to  make (her) feel better.  Then, Andrea asked what was wrong and Abella cried,  I miss Obama. Andrea explained:  Abella has been an Obama fan since day one. She has grown up with him as a hero in our household, and as such has always talked about how much she loves him. I was just listening to the DNC speeches, and she asked me what they were talking about. So I explained to her that the country is getting ready to elect a new president. She immediately had tears running down her face and explained to me that Barack Obama was our president and how could we get a new one when we already had one. Source: Daily MailHere s the video: All is not lost for Abella, though. She thinks Hillary Clinton will be a good president.Andrea told Abella that maybe Obama should know how she feels, and she offered to send the President the video. Hopefully, as with Kameria, Abella will soon get an invitation to the White House.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"August 2, 2016"

Wow and it s not even October yet! Things are not looking good for #CrookedHillary The House Oversight Committee is reviewing a Reddit post that alleges an IT specialist who worked on Hillary Clinton s private server sought advice on how to alter the contents of  VERY VIP  emails, according to Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.).Meadows is the chairman of the panel s Government Operations subcommittee. The Reddit post issue and its connection to Paul Combetta is currently being reviewed by OGR staff and evaluations are being made as to the authenticity of the post,  Meadows told The Hill.

The Denver, Colo.-based firm managed Clinton s private server.The Reddit Archives that are allegedly Combetta s, can be found near end of article. Combetta was granted immunity from Obama s Department of Justice in their investigation of Clinton.Combetta was the employee who deleted all of Hillary Clinton s emails.According users on Reddit, Combetta asked for assistance in July 2014 from Reddit users on how to purge emails and how to strip VIP s email address from  a bunch of archived emails.  -GPhttps://twitter.com/juliangwan/status/778006379596509184The post, which has been deleted but can be read in images archived by Reddit users, coincides with the discovery of Clinton s use of the server.Busted:Proof of Intent to Obstruct Justice 2 Years Ago from #HillarysHackerReddit Post Reveals. pic.twitter.com/aVgdV8gDla  The Truther (@4evertruther) September 19, 2016 I may be facing a very interesting situation where I need to strip out a VIP s (VERY VIP) email address from a bunch of archived email  Basically, they don t want the VIP s email address exposed to anyone, and want to be able to either strip out or replace the email address in the to/from fields in all of the emails we want to send out,  reads the post, by a user called  stonetear.

If it is determined that the request to change email addresses was made by someone so closely aligned with the Secretary s IT operation as Mr. Combetta, then it will certainly prompt additional inquiry,  Meadows told The Hill.  The date of the Reddit post in relationship to the establishment of the Select Committee on Benghazi is also troubling. The Reddit message was sent on July 23, 2014, according to an archive of the page saved by other users. The day before, the Benghazi Committee had reached an agreement with the State Department on the production of related records, according the FBI s investigation into Clinton s use of the server.The identity of the  stonetear  user is not confirmed. Reddit users point to the fact that an account on the online marketplace Easy for a Paul Combetta has the username  stonetear  and the inactive website combetta.com is registered to the email address stonetear@gmail.com.Combetta appeared under subpoena in a committee hearing last week on the alleged destruction of evidence, but both he and colleague Bill Thornton exercised their Fifth Amendment right not to testify.borismkv: There is no supported way to do what you re asking. You can only delete emails after they re stored in the database. You can t change them. If there was a feature in Exchange that allowed this, it could result in major legal issues. There may be ways to hack a solution, but I am not aware of any. permalinkembedsavegive goldstonetear: As a PST file or exported MSG files, this could be done though, yes? The issue is that these emails involve the private email address of someone you d recognize, and we re trying to replace it with a placeholder address as to not expose it.exproject: To my knowledge, there s no way to edit existing messages, that s a possibility for a discovery nightmare. To strip/rename on outbound/inbound you could rewrite it with a transport rule.stonetear: That wouldn t work on existing messages though right?odoprasm: Is there no way to access and edb manually?stonetear: I have full access to the server   what are you suggesting with the EDB file?stonetear: I think maybe I wasn t clear enough in the original post. I have these emails available in a PST file. Can I rewrite them in the PST? I could also export to MSG and do some sort of batch find/replace. Anyone know of tools that might help with this?exproject: Just because you have the messages available in multiple formats and locations doesn t change that it s an attribute of the envelope not meant to be rewritten. The functionality is just not built into any tool I know of. Having that functionality would create the ability to screw with discovery (I mean, there could be mitigation with versioning, but that would need other configuration) While it may not be a read-only part of the envelope(I m not actually sure), the only tool that MIGHT be able to do what you want is MFCMapi, and I don t think you want to play with that for this job. The chance of getting it wrong would be pretty high I think and it is not a particularly friendly tool. I m not sure it could be scripted with it either. My recommendation would be what /u/borismkv said. Making a mailbox for VIP and telling them to use that. Forwarding to VIPs mailbox would be ripe for them to just respond directly instead of responding through his relay mailbox. As for your existing messages, if the current users absolutely cannot see the existing messages, you ll need to do a search and export and just forcibly remove the messages from their mailboxes. It s not clean and not advised by me, but if they don t want VIPs address out there it will need to be removed. I would do a search with his email address as the query with -LogOnly -LogLevel Full and see what kind of results you get.EDIT: Holy shit they actually deleted all their comments from a 2 year old reddit post, I think we hit gold on this one. Archive.is link of the deleted reddit postCan somebody make sure we have the twitter posts archived too? I really don t trust twitter to keep those up.  Gateway PunditHere is the ARCHIVE of the messages that were deleted on Reddit.UPDATE: Here s a screengrab of the archived pictures from Reddit:The committee has scheduled another hearing on the  preservation of State Department records  for Thursday.Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) has issued a criminal referral asking the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia to investigate deletions from the server.This latest probe stems from revelations from the 58-page report issued by the FBI summarizing its investigation into Clinton s use of the server.According to the FBI s report, an unnamed Platte River Networks technician deleted an archive of emails from the server in March 2015   after the House Select Committee on Benghazi had issued a subpoena for records relating to the 2012 attack on the Libyan outpost.According to the FBI s notes, longtime Clinton aide Cheryl Mills instructed Platte River Networks to delete a set of archived emails in December 2014. Mills told investigators Clinton had decided she no longer needed access to emails older than 60 days.But the technician apparently forgot the request and didn t immediately comply. According to the FBI report, between March 25 and March 31 of 2015, the technician  believed he had an  oh shit  moment and   deleted the Clinton archive mailbox from the [Platte River Networks] server. Reporting from The New York Times has since identified Combetta as that technician, citing an anonymous law enforcement official and others familiar with the FBI probe.Clinton and Mills told the FBI that they had no knowledge of the technician s deletion of the emails. The technician, according to the report,  was aware of the existence of the [Benghazi Committee] preservation request and the fact that it meant he should not disturb Clinton s email data on the [Platte River Networks] server.

Duncan Hunter, one of the lawmakers with whom the soldier spoke about Obama administration hostage rescue policies, has asked the Pentagon inspector general to investigate whether the Army is springing allegations against personnel such as the Green Beret as pure retaliation.Lt. Col. Jason Amerine, the Special Forces soldier, is due to testify before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs about what he considers reprisals against him as a whistleblower. After I made protected disclosures to Congress, the Army suspended my clearance, removed me from my job, launched a criminal investigation and deleted my retirement orders with a view to court martial me after I exercised that Constitutional right,  says Col. Amerine, according to partial remarks provided to The Washington Times by Mr. Hunter s office. For nearly five months, I have received no relief from the military and there has been no transparency in their investigation of me. My pay was even stopped briefly after the Army deleted my retirement orders. Mr. Hunter, California Republican and member of the House Armed Services Committee, wrote to Jon T. Rymer, the inspector general, about three soldiers against whom he believed Army Secretary John McHugh retaliated. He asked for an IG investigation into Mr. McHugh s use of the Criminal Investigation Command. Specifically, my concern is that the Army   under the leadership of Secretary of the Army   has used CID for the purpose of influencing actions/outcomes and retaliating against soldiers,  he wrote.He cited three soldiers:  Col. Amerine. The officer worked in a small Army unit at the Pentagon and he devoted himself to developing policies to gain the release of Americans held by Islamic extremists. He came to believe the administration s hostage policies were in disarray and told Mr. Hunter. The congressman proposed legislation to create a hostage coordinator to work with the various agencies involved, such as the FBI, Pentagon and State Department.  Maj. Matt Golsteyn. Also a Green Beret, Maj. Golsteyn saw his valor awards and Special Forces tab stripped by Secretary McHugh. The officer was accused of killing a Taliban bomb-maker, but was never officially charged. He faces a board of inquiry hearing.  Sgt. First Class Earl Plumlee. Sgt. Plumlee was nominated for the Medal of Honor, the nation s highest military award, for repelling an attack on a base in Afghanistan and saving lives. The MOH was endorsed by top commanders, including Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But Mr. McHugh downgraded the award to a Silver Star. Mr. Hunter said it was based on a  questionable CID investigation. Col. Amerine already has filed a whistleblower retaliation complaint with the IG. The Army probe began after the FBI complained that Col. Amerine was providing information to Congress. I have personally met with the Federal Bureau of Investigation on the developments leading up to the Army investigation,  Mr. Hunter told Mr. Rymer.  An investigation, I firmly believe, was not warranted, but continues to be unjustifiably delayed. Col. Amerine holds a special place in the history of the Afghanistan war. He led a joint Green Beret-Afghan team in the 2001 invasion, and fought along side Hamid Karzai, the future president.An Army spokesman has said,  As a matter of policy, we do not confirm the names of individuals who may or may not be under investigation to protect the integrity of a possible ongoing investigation, as well as the privacy rights of all involved. However, I note that both the law and Army policy would prohibit initiating an investigation based solely on a Soldier s protected communications with.Via: Washington Times ",Government News,"Jun 12, 2015"

5305, WATCH: The Amazing Moment That Made Bernie Cry At The Convention,"Bernie Sanders had an amazingly touching moment at the 2016 Democratic Convention that brought the usually stoic Vermont senator to tears. During the roll call of the states to cast their official delegate votes for the presidential nomination, the usual procedure was disrupted when the Democrats Abroad delegation was up for a vote.Bernie Sanders  brother, Larry, was part of the Democrats Abroad group, which is comprised of voters who live overseas. The delegation held back one of their votes after making their official submissions for Clinton and Sanders.Larry Sanders was designated as the person who would deliver the final vote, and he launched into a speech about the parents of the Sanders brothers. I want to read for this convention the names of our parents, Eli Sanders, and Dorothy Glassberg Sanders. They did not have easy lives, and they died young. They would be immensely proud of their son and his accomplishments. They loved him. They loved the New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt and would be especially proud that Bernard is renewing that vision. It is with enormous pride that I cast my vote for Bernie Sanders! The tearful statement was greeted with loud cheers and applause from convention goers. Sanders was later featured as Vermont made the last vote in the roll call, as he called for a vote by acclamation to declare Hillary Clinton the nominee. The motion was accepted, and Clinton became the first woman in American history to be a presidential nominee of one of the two major parties.Larry is Sanders  older brother and has lived in Oxford, England since the 1960s. He is active in UK politics and has served as a spokesperson for the Green Party of England and Wales.

8211, Bernie Was Asked To Say One Nice Thing About Trump And Cruz – His Response Is Hilarious (IMAGE/VIDEO),"Bernie Sanders made his first appearance on television after his  YUGGGEEE  win in the New Hampshire primaries with the hosts of The View  and it was the perfect mixture of seriousness as well as a little light-humored fun. Bernie began his discussion talking about  the greed and recklessness of Wall Street,  but when he was asked to say just one nice thing about Donald Trump or Ted Cruz, he couldn t!Considering his Republican rivals have never said a single nice thing about Bernie Sanders other than he s a  socialist,  his response was fitting. Here was his first reaction when asked to say something nice about Trump: What can I say? When pressed further,  come on Bernie, he has nice ties; nice hair?  he said very sarcastically  humble  earning him a huge applause. Donald Trump is anything but humble, but we have a feeling everyone already knew that. The guy puts his name on everything for crying out loud.And   when he was asked about Ted Cruz, the only thing he could say was  loud.  Come on Bernie, there must be something nice you can say about the Senator from Texas!He did have nice things to say about John Kasich, though, calling him an  old friend,  and he does think Hillary Clinton is  intelligent.  Very classy with those responses.After winning New Hampshire, Bernie is starting to get more attention from Donald Trump. He used to ignore him preferring to attack Hillary, but now things have changed. While Bernie appeared on The View, Trump was busy taking shots at the Senator from Vermont. On CBS This Morning Trump ignored the polls (go figure, right?) and suggested he would take Bernie head on in a matchup. Real Clear Politics shows Bernie beating Trump handily, though; not the other way around. I would beat Bernie easily. The one thing we have in common is trade. The difference between us is, [Sanders] can t do anything about it. I can. Pic via Real Clear PoliticsFeatured image from screen capture.",News,"February 10, 2016"
2145, Comey GOING PUBLIC With Russia/Trump Investigation After Pressure From Congress,"FBI Director James Comey could very likely be the reason we have a President Trump. Just shy of two weeks prior to the 2016 election, Comey sent a letter to Congress that essentially said that his investigation into then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton s private email server could potentially be re-opened. Despite his open condemnation of Hillary s activities, Comey kept mum on the investigations   the much more SERIOUS inquires   on the other side, which would be those into the possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign into the election s eventual outcome.Well, all of that is now coming to a head. Trump s team has been repeatedly caught being linked to Russia and lying about it. His national security adviser, Michael Flynn, was forced to resign for his lies to Mike Pence about his Russia ties, and has since registered with the United States government as a foreign agent. It has also been found that the newly confirmed Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, has been forced to recuse himself from any Russia-Trump investigations due to his lying to Senator Al Franken during his confirmation hearings regarding his own conversations with the Ambassador to Russia.Now, it seems that there is a firm way to bring this to an end. Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) seem to have had a meeting with FBI Director Comey on March 2. According to Whitehouse, during that meeting, Comey promised him and his GOP counterpart that they would have the answer we ve all been waiting for by this coming Wednesday   which is whether or not the Federal Bureau of Investigation is actively probing the activities of the Trump campaign with regards to Russia and the 2016 election.Whitehouse says that not only will Comey tell them whether or not he and his agency are investigating Trump s Russia ties, but he will also go into  the scope of their Russia/Trump investigation because he had not been able to at that point say that there was one. Well, this should definitely be interesting. After all, Comey was more than willing to throw the election to Trump by screwing Hillary Clinton with nonsense that amounted to nothing, while Vladimir Putin installed a Russian agent and his cronies as head of the United States government. Hopefully, once Comey is under oath, whatever is revealed will take Trump down once and for all.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"March 14, 2017"
18506,“THE WAR ON COAL IS OVER”…First New Coal Mine Of Trump Presidency Opens In Pennsylvania…Another Promise Kept [VIDEO]," So much winning!  Were  going to be winning so much, you re going to be sick of winning!  -Candidate Donald J. TrumpPresident Donald Trump hailed the opening Thursday of a new coal mine as proof deregulation is helping bring jobs to the industry, even though plans for the mine s opening were made well before Trump s election.Corsa Coal Corp. will supply coal used in making steel and is expected to generate up to 100 full-time jobs. The company said it decided in August to open the Acosta mine 60 miles south of Pittsburgh after a steel industry boom drove up prices for metallurgical coal.Under a tent perched hundreds of feet above a freshly dug coal pit, about 200 miners, business leaders, and politicians celebrated amid the surge of enthusiasm for the industry. Mining headgear lay atop red, white, and blue table cloths labeled  Make Coal Great Again. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf said the mine was part of an effort to bring back jobs and industry to the state. Pennsylvania awarded a $3 million grant for the project. We have not always capitalized on our standing as one of the world s leaders in these resources, but we re changing that,  Wolf said.Trump has made reversing the decades-long decline in coal mining the central tenet of his environmental policy, blaming federal regulations aimed at curbing planet-warming carbon emissions for job losses in the industry. Trump and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt have targeted laws that protected waterways from coal waste and required states to slash carbon emissions from power plants. About a dozen protesters chanted in opposition to the mine at the opening.Trump noted the impending opening of the mine last week during his speech announcing the nation s withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. He said then he had hoped to attend the event; he participated via recorded video message, taking partial credit for the opening. One by one, we re eliminating the regulations that threaten your jobs, and that s one of the big reasons you re opening today: Less regulation,  Trump said.  We have withdrawn the United States from the horrendous Paris climate accord, something that would have put our country back decades and decades, we would have never allowed ourselves to be great again.

7201, Mississippi Senate OKs Bill Giving Church Members License To Kill Perceived Threats,"Mississippi Republicans are taking a  shoot first, ask questions later  approach to preventing potential church violence with a bill that amounts to legalizing religious  security  squads tasked with killing perceived threats. This week, the state s Republican-led senate passed the so-called  Mississippi Church Protection Act  which would militarize the state s churches while also walking back gun regulations and stripping away oversight.The bill would allow churches to create security programs and designate and train members to carry concealed weapons. It would provide criminal and legal protections to those serving as church security.The bill also would allow concealed carry in a holster without a permit in Mississippi, expanding a measure passed last year that allowed concealed carry without a permit in a purse, satchel or briefcase, and another recent law that allows open carry in public.The bill also seeks to prohibit Mississippi officials from enforcing any federal agency regulations or executive orders that would violate the state constitution   an attempt to federal gun restrictions not passed by Congress.Mississippi church goers will now get to assign church members as  security  which can carry concealed weapons without permits and are protected from legal liability if their actions result in death based on a designation of  justifiable homicide    the same legal standing that we afford police officers on duty.@pourmecoffee It passed pic.twitter.com/H8WvOdHFA4  pourmecoffee (@pourmecoffee) March 30, 2016What could go wrong?Much of this baffling new legislation is in direct response to NRA lobbying directives to erode existing gun laws in order to create a  polite  society of heavily-armed citizens. Exploiting tragedy (and ignoring irony) the NRA has used recent mass shootings to push for more guns, not less. The narrative goes that if only churches would have access to firearms, shootings like the one in Charleston, South Carolina, could be prevented.The premise, as tempting as it sounds for would-be vigilantes, has been thoroughly debunked both in theory and in practice. Data suggests that as the number of guns increase, the risk of someone being shot by those guns also increases. Places with a lot of  good guys with guns  tend to have higher incidences of gun injuries. Go figure. At the same time, anecdotal evidence supports these warnings as well. We ve seen that guns in churches often lead to disastrous accidents, while at the same time not once stopping a mass shooting in a house of worship.With the removal of even permit requirements, Mississippi is planning on handing over the power of life and death to a bunch of untrained, untested amateurs who won t even have the risk of prosecution keeping their index finger off the trigger. A militarized church security unit assigned by the church, trained by the church, and meant to protect the church by any means necessary. If Mississippi legislators can t see the inherent danger in this as the bill heads to the House of Representatives to be finalized, then we are in a lot of trouble.Featured image via George Frey/Getty Images",News,"March 30, 2016"
996, Brace Yourself For 74 Percent Higher Health Care Premiums Under New Bill,"According to a new report, health insurance premiums will shoot up 74% for the Average American under the health care bill being served up by the Republican Senate. Older customers will be hit even harder with some paying twice as much for plans comparable to what they currently have.The nonpartisan group Kaiser Family Foundation analyzed the costs for individual market plans that cover 70% of medical costs   what most Obamacare plans cover   and factored in insurance prices and subsidies under the Republican bill.Mitch McConnel s health bill encourages customers to purchase plans with high deductibles, reduces subsidies for lower-income Americas, and allows insurers to charge older people more.These changes would result in plans varying dramatically due to age and income, with low-income and older persons suffering the most.People between 55 and 64 would see an increase of 115$ on average, which is more than double the Obama care prices. Low-income Americans who make less than $24,000 a year would receive an increase of 177$, versus only 57% for people that bring in more money.Younger and higher income Americans will see less sweeping changes in their insurance premiums.Customers who have the disadvantage of being bother older and low-income will see premiums go up 294%, an increase of almost fourfold.The Senior Vice President for Special Initiatives at Kaiser Family Foundation, Larry Levitt, weighed in on the drastic situation. Faced with premiums almost quadrupling, many of these low-income adults would tend to either go without coverage entirely because it s unaffordable or gravitate towards a plan with lower premiums and higher deductibles. The Congressional Budget Office even admits this bill is going to be disastrous for Americans. Their own analysis concluded that premiums will most likely be too high for low-income Americans to purchase coverage, causing millions more to be stranded without insurance than under the current health care law.Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"June 27, 2017"
1635, Donald Trump Learned A New Word And It Should Give You Chills (VIDEO),"Donald Trump isn t enjoying his time as President. In a series of interviews marking the first 100 days of his presidency, he s done an awful lot of whining and complaining, including saying that the job is much harder than he thought.One of the reasons the job is so hard for him is that he s not a dictator, as much as he d like to be one. His powers are limited by a document called the Constitution and that frustrates the hell out of him, even though he has an entirely Republican federal government.In an interview with Fox News on Friday, Trump appeared to have learned a new word, and he used it four times in reference to the Constitution. That word was  archaic,  and in his context, it was particularly disconcerting because it signaled his desire to completely do away with the constraints of the Constitution and with our system of checks and balances.Remember when White nationalist House stooge and millennial most likely to be punched Steven Miller said that  that the powers of the president to protect our country are very substantial and will not be questioned?  A collective chill went up the spines of thinking Americans. Be prepared to feel that chill again. Here s what Trump said on Friday.In an interview with Fox News to mark the 100-day mark, he declared himself  disappointed  with congressional Republicans, despite his many  great relationships  with them.He blamed the constitutional checks and balances built in to US governance.  It s a very rough system,  he said.  It s an archaic system   It s really a bad thing for the country. Here s the video:Mostly, Trump wants to get rid of the filibuster. He has no authority whatsoever over the rules of the Senate, and while the Senate leadership could change the rules, in theory, it would be quite short-sighted because it would mean that the next time Democrats have even a slim majority, Republicans would be powerless to get anything accomplished or to stop a Democratic agenda.When President Obama wasn t able to get past the filibuster, Donald Trump called him weak and ineffectual. Now that the loafer is on Trump s foot, it s the Constitution s fault. Do you have chills yet?Featured image via Getty Images/Pool",News,"April 30, 2017"
10346,JOHN MCCAIN ATTACKS President Trump From Hospital Bed Only Days After Brain Cancer Diagnosis,"Senator John McCain just couldn t help himself. While millions of Americans were praying for his recovery, after he was diagnosed with brain cancer earlier this week, McCain took to Twitter to admonish President Trump over his decision to end a failed program that was supposed to train, fund and arm Syrians to fight Assad and ISIS.The program has been a complete failure and cost Americans millions of dollars.The Hill  In February, 2012, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who both serve on the Senate Armed Services committee urged that the United States arm opposition forces in Syria. War-hawks McCain and Graham argued that arming rebel fighters in the country could help beat back a Syrian government with close ties to Iran. Breaking Syria apart from Iran could be as important to containing a nuclear Iran as sanctions,  Graham said at a press conference in Kabul, according to the New York Times.  If the Syrian regime is replaced with another form of government that doesn t tie its future to the Iranians, the world is a better place. Where have we heard that strategy before? Oh yeah in Libya and in Iraq. How did that work out for America and for the Middle East John? McCain was apparently well enough by yesterday to warn tweeted his  sparring partners  in Congress that he d  be back soon  and told them to  stand-by!  Goodness knows, America couldn t survive without the votes and guidance of Trump-hater and leader of the Republican  we don t have to do what the American voters elected us to do  opposition party.I greatly appreciate the outpouring of support   unfortunately for my sparring partners in Congress, I'll be back soon, so stand-by!  John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) July 20, 2017Only one hour later, war-hawk McCain fired back with another tweet admonishing President Trump for ending the failed program created to assist the Syrian opposition.

14720,"Serial Plagiarist Does Victory Dance Over White People Dying, Trump Can’t Save You!","White people the only lives that DON T matter. Imagine the outrage if he were taking a victory lap over a study showing Muslims dying in increasing numbers Citing a study that shows Middle American whites are dying in increasing numbers, like a twisted and bitter eugenicist, serial-plagiarist Fareed Zakaria doesn t even attempt to contain his glee. By painting those who are supposedly dying as useless, drug-addicted ragers, he paints a picture of a weak, angry, and ultimately stupid ethnic group getting what it deserves.If this were any other group, Zakaria would not be using the pages of the Washington Post for a victory dance. Instead, he would be launching an emotional blackmail campaign to cure this  epidemic  with hundreds of billions of federal dollars. Like most of the elite media, though, Zakaria despises Middle America, so he joyously assumes the study is accurate and bloodlessly screams  Told You So! The headline says it all:  America s Self-Destructive Whites,  and naturally the opening paragraph contains the words  Donald  and  Trump. Why is Middle America killing itself? The fact itself is probably the most important social science finding in years. It is already reshaping American politics. The Post s Jeff Guo notes that the people who make up this cohort are  largely responsible for Donald Trump s lead in the race for the Republican nomination for president. What does this  epidemic  mean to Zakaria?That it s time for compassion?Time for government action?Time for understanding?No. It means  more rage  from creepy Middle America:The key question is why, and exploring it provides answers that suggest that the rage dominating U.S. politics will only get worse.Zakaria hints that the study s numbers are a tad shaky, but that doesn t stop him from doing a happy dance around the fact that Middle America s Got It Coming .The main causes of death are as striking as the fact itself: suicide, alcoholism, and overdoses of prescription and illegal drugs.  People seem to be killing themselves, slowly or quickly,  Deaton told me. These circumstances are usually caused by stress, depression and despair.Middle America s a Bunch of Wussies .A conventional explanation for this middle-class stress and anxiety is that globalization and technological change have placed increasing pressures on the average worker in industrialized nations. But the trend is absent in any other Western country   it s an exclusively American phenomenon. And the United States is actually relatively insulated from the pressures of globalization, having a vast, self-contained internal market.Stupid Middle America Should Stop Voting Against the Welfare State Deaton speculated to me that perhaps Europe s more generous welfare state might ease some of the fears associated with the rapid change.Middle America s Spoiled By White Privilege [O]ther groups might not expect that their income, standard of living and social status are destined to steadily improve. They don t have the same confidence that if they work hard, they will surely get ahead. In fact, Rouse said that after hundreds of years of slavery, segregation and racism, blacks have developed ways to cope with disappointment and the unfairness of life[.]They do not assume that the system is set up for them.

1027, Donald Trump Jr. Throws Massive Hissy Fit Over Johnny Depp’s Bad Joke,"Donald Trump Jr. is so furious over Johnny Depp s bad assassination joked that he wants Disney to fire the actor.Speaking in England on Thursday, Depp made a joke about actors assassinating presidents. When was the last time an actor assassinated a president? I want to clarify,  he continued,  I m not an actor. I lie for a living. However, it s been awhile, and maybe it s time. By the way, this is going to be in the press and it ll be horrible,  Depp acknowledged.  It s just a question; I m not insinuating anything. Well, the Pirates of the Caribbean star was right about the last part. His comments did end up  in the press  and it was  horrible.  Depp quickly realized that this bad joke was a mistake and apologized just hours later. I apologize for the bad joke I attempted last night in poor taste about President Trump,  he said in a statement to PEOPLE magazine.  It did not come out as intended, and I intended no malice. I was only trying to amuse, not to harm anyone. To be clear, no, jokes like this are not acceptable, especially in today s tense political climate. But Donald Trump Jr. is absolutely beside himself over Depp s remarks and so he did what all Trumps do: he threw a temper tantrum all over Twitter. Junior s goal?

So here goes.Numerous reports coming out of the Senate Judiciary Committee last week said that former FBI Director James Comey made the decision not to refer Clinton for prosecution long before he even interviewed key witnesses, including Hillary.Remember, the Republicans now control this committee. So bad news isn t going to be stifled anymore.Clinton, you probably remember,  lost  her private emails, which she d been storing on a personal computer server. Comey chastised her harshly in a televised speech but then said there was a unanimous decision not to recommend prosecution.Clinton s emails, which were stolen by the Russians, have never been found. But as I ve mentioned numerous times, the messages are still in the possession of the National Security Agency (NSA), which offered to give them to the FBI.Comey turned down that offer, according to a source who has been very reliable.I ve also mentioned that Comey fibbed when he said his agents unanimously agreed that prosecution was unnecessary. In fact, my source says that FBI agents were irate about the decision not to go after Clinton.   NYP ",left-news,"Sep 5, 2017"

9892,Trump Posed For Pic With Two Kids And Everyone Immediately Noticed One Shocking Thing In It,"As one of the most approachable presidents in history, President Donald Trump didn t hesitate to partake in a picture when two kids approached and asked for a photo. He s seen smiling in between a brother and sister duo in the picture. As soon as the photo hit the Internet, everyone noticed one shocking thing in it.The photo looks like every other fan shot out there, with two beaming children who happened to get the opportunity to meet the president. However, it s now gone viral after viewers realized who the children were and why their paths had crossed with the president s.Elijah and Gianna Lucas live in Fresno, California but were in Washington, D.C. on Monday to attend a ceremony in honor of National Peace Officers  Memorial Day. Like thousands of others, they sat in the crowd and listened to our Commander-in-Chief speak about the importance of police work in America and the sacrifice it often is, which has gone without recognition for eight years under Barack Obama. Trump not only showed deep appreciation for the men and women in law enforcement but their families as well, many of whom are left to pick up the pieces after losing their hero in the line of duty.While Obama routinely recognized thugs shot by cops and incited riots around it, Trump does just the opposite in addressing the senseless loss of life by those who work to serve and protect everyone and mentions them by name. This means more to Elijah and Gianna than it does for most since these siblings are two of five in their family who are now growing up without their father, who died while on duty on October 31, 2016. President Trump holds Fresno County Sheriff s Sgt. Rod Lucas  sheriff s identification card as he poses with Lucas  children, Elijah and Gianna Lucas, at the Capitol in Washington, D.C.I don t recall Obama ever announcing his condolences when an officer of the law was killed, let alone take time to meet personally with their families and take a selfie with their children. He did this for thugs  moms seeking vengeance in their criminal child s death by cop but refused to give the same attention and respect where it really belongs   on the true victims.What s seen in this shot of the president with Fresno officer Sgt. Rod Lucas  kids is a genuine joy that the Trump had to be a part of this day for them, to personally tell them that their dad was a hero who is appreciated for his service. Lucas died an accidental death at the hands of one of his law enforcement colleagues on October 31, 2016. They were shifting guns around, talking about different ways to carry a second gun, when a gun was accidentally discharged, and a bullet struck Lucas in the chest,  Breitbart reports.  Investigators determined no foul play was involved. Rather, Lucas, a 20-year-veteran of the force, was  having a conversation with a nine-year veteran detective about the various ways to carry backup weapons when the shot was fired . In years past during Police Week, families and children of fallen officers didn t get the recognition they deserved from our president. Now that Trump is in office, he s more than making up for that lost time under Obama and ensuring children who woke up to bad news that their mom or dad wasn t coming home, feel that they aren t forgotten.In an incredible moment at the same event on Monday, held in front of the U.S. Capitol in D.C., Trump turned his speech to a 6-year-old boy named Micah, who he saw in the audience. Micah had lost his officer father in a shootout he was involved in while on the job in Phoenix, Arizona. Trump wanted to give him something special and personal and did so by tossing the boy his hat he had under the podium, which he was saving for himself to wear after the event until he found a far better use for it.Until Trump took office, the presidency was more concerned about disarming our officers and sympathizing with the families of thugs who died in the commission of a crime. Whenever a cop was killed, the past president wouldn t have even addressed it. However, that era officially ended on Monday when Trump posed for a selfie with two fatherless kids and tossed his hat to this little boy before saying,  I want you to know that patriotic Americans of all backgrounds truly support and love our police.

6340, Trump Just Proved He Has The Foreign Diplomacy Skills Of A Whiny Child,"Donald Trump has so many feuds going on at the moment it can be hard to keep track of them all. One of the most potentially damaging feuds, though, is with the United Kingdom s Prime Minister David Cameron. Now, that feud continues with Trump s latest comments directed towards Cameron.Cameron has made his opinion of the guaranteed Republican presidential nomination very clear. Back in December, Cameron publicly stated that he thinks Trump s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States is  stupid, divisive and wrong.  Cameron s statement couldn t be more accurate, as Trump s proposal goes against the very basic principles of the United States and would be logistically impossible to enforce.During an interview with Piers Morgan, Trump spoke out against Cameron s comments, offering a sad attempt at an olive branch towards Cameron, where he insisted that he is not stupid and is a unifier. It looks like we re not going to have a very good relationship. Who knows! I hope to have a good relationship with him but it sounds like he s not willing to address the problem either,  Trump said in the interview, according to the Jerusalem Post.  Well, number one I m not stupid, Okay. I can tell you that, right now   just the opposite. Number two, in terms of divisive: I don t think I m a divisive person. I m a unifier, unlike our president now, I m a unifier,  he Trump concluded.As bizarre as it is to hear a grown man insist to another that he is in fact not stupid, Cameron never actually called Trump himself stupid. He called his policy stupid because it is. It s also nothing more than an incredibly xenophobic, racist, and ridiculous bit of fear mongering. It s one of the first policy proposals that Trump introduced. It sounded the alarm bells that Trump is more than just a buffoon looking for attention, it showed the world that he could actually be a very dangerous threat to the United States and the world if given the opportunity to seize actual political power.Featured image from (Photo by Isaac Brekken/Getty Images)",News,"May 16, 2016"
16494,FBI AND CIA Host Job Fair In U.S. City With 40% MUSLIM Population…Feeling Safer Yet?,"Who better to help root out terror than a person whose religion forbids them from ratting out someone of their own faith? The FBI and CIA are looking to increase the  diversity  of their agencies and that includes hiring more Arab Americans.One of the ways it hopes to achieve its goal of greater diversity is by holding a career fair in America s most Islamic city   Dearborn, Michigan.In  Stop the Islamization of America: A Practical Guide to the Resistance,  renowned activist Pamela Geller provides the answer, offering proven, practical guidance on how freedom lovers can stop jihadist initiatives in local communities.Notices about the career fair have been posted on the Arab-American Chamber of Commerce s Facebook page, as well as in local news publications in Dearborn.The Press and Guide, for instance, ran a public notice that stated the following; Learn about working for two top government agencies during an informational session being held by The Central Intelligence Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation. Attendees will learn about both agencies and have the chance to hear about career opportunities as well as network with CIA and FBI representatives. The event takes place at 6 p.m. July 19 at the Ford Motor Company Conference & Event Center, 1151 Village Road, Dearborn. A formal presentation will run from 6 to 7:30 p.m. followed by networking from 7:30 to 8:30. Both the FBI and CIA are seeking to increase diversity within the organizations and find specifically skilled applicants to fulfill critical roles within the agencies. Those at the event will hear about specific job positions and qualifications through a panel discussion as well as the agencies  similarities, strategic differences and shared commitment to thwart threats to national security. Dinner will be provided, but seating is limited. RSVP by July 12 to Christina Petrosian at chrissp@ucia.gov. Petrosian did not immediately respond to emails from WND.Dick Manasseri, communications director for Secure Michigan, a citizen-watchdog group fighting what it sees as the Islamization of Michigan, said he found the advertisements troubling, but not surprising. How can the FBI/CIA vet job applicants when they cannot mention the word Shariah?  Manasseri said.Manasseri was referring to the scrubbing of all FBI training manuals, removing all references to Shariah and Islam that were seen as discriminatory by Muslim groups. That concession was made in response to complaints by the Council of American-Islamic Relations, or CAIR, by then-Deputy National Security Adviser John Brennan, who is now in charge of the CIA. How can the FBI/CIA vet the information provided on applications from Shariah-adherents who are encouraged to lie to non-Muslims when it furthers the goals of Shariah?  Manasseri told WND.The Obama administration has also invited former CAIR officials into its circle of advisers within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The opportunities for further federal government infiltration increases the probability that we will see Shariah courts in Southeast Michigan before long,  Manasseri said.Dearborn s population is about 40 percent Arab and includes both Sunni and Shiite Muslims. A minority of the Arab-American community in Dearborn are Christian.And the Dearborn area is getting more Muslim by the month thanks to the current Syrian refugee program being carried out by President Obama. Just in the last nine months the U.S. State Department has delivered 143 Syrians to Dearborn for permanent resettlement.Another 174 Syrians have been sent to Troy, which is only 25 miles north of Dearborn.Michigan has been targeted to receive nearly half of the 10,000 Syrian refugees Obama has promised the United Nations he would admit into the U.S.After getting off to a slow start, Syrian arrivals are now occurring by the hundreds per day. On Wednesday another 249 Syrians arrived in the U.S. for permanent resettlement.Obama s pledge of 10,000 Syrian refugees in fiscal 2016, which ends Sept. 30, now appears to be a deadline he will make. His State Department has delivered nearly 60 percent of the 10,000 with two and a half months to go. Via: WND ",Government News,"Jul 16, 2016"
3947, Former Classmate: Trump Smacked His Son So Hard It Knocked ‘Him To The Floor’,"We ve all seen pictures of the Trumps in their home surrounded by tacky gold decor, complete with their young son Barron in a suit with toys in front of him while he stares at the camera off to the side of his parents. It s a life most of us can never imagine while we re paying our monthly bills. So what s it like growing up with Donald Trump as a father? According to Scott Melker, a former classmate of Donald Trump Jr. s, at the University of Pennsylvania, being the former reality show star s son wasn t what one might imagine. Or, given Trump s temperament, it might be exactly what you d imagine.On Facebook, Mekler told of the animosity Trump s son had for this father. I was hanging out in a freshman dorm with some friends, next door to Donald Jr. s room. I walked out of the room to find Donald Trump at his son s door, there to pick him up for a baseball game,  he recalls.  There were quite a few students standing around watching, trying to catch a glimpse of the famed real estate magnate. Don Jr. opened the door, wearing a Yankee jersey. Then Mekler told of the moment Trump slapped his son in the face in front of others. Without saying a word, his father slapped him across the face, knocking him to the floor in front of all of his classmates. He simply said  put on a suit and meet me outside,  and closed the door,  Melker wrote. Donald Jr. was a drunk in college. Every memory I have of him is of him stumbling around campus falling over or passing out in public, with his arm in a sling from injuring himself while drinking,  he continued.  He absolutely despised his father, and hated the attention that his last name afforded him. His nickname was  Diaper Don,  because of his tendency to fall asleep drunk in other people s beds and urinate.   I always felt terrible for him,  he continued.Mekler said part of his reason for voting for Hillary Clinton is because  in light of what I saw that day, it is clear to me that Donald Trump lacks the temperament and basic social decency to run our country. To be clear, we are not demonizing Trump s son for having an alleged drinking problem during his college days. Whether Melker s story is accurate or not, we re not sure, but given Trump s awful temper, it s difficult to discount it.Photo by Saul Loeb-Pool via Getty.",News,"November 4, 2016"
18659,LIST OF COMEY’S 10 BIGGEST SCREW UPS As FBI Director…Why His Firing Was Long Overdue,"Comey will inevitably be remembered for the controversial role he played in the 2016 presidential election, where his agency conducted surveillance of the Trump campaign as well as investigated the Clinton camp for mishandling classified materials, giving both sides arguments for how the FBI ultimately swayed the vote.But even before the 2016 campaign, the FBI endured a number of humiliations under Comey s tenure. Most damning were revelations that the FBI was generally aware of almost every terrorist who successfully struck America over the last eight years.1. Before he bombed the Boston Marathon, the FBI interviewed Tamerlan Tsarnaev but let him go. Russia sent the Obama Administration a second warning, but the FBI opted against investigating him again.2. Shortly after the NSA scandal exploded in 2013, the FBI was exposed conducting its own data mining on innocent Americans; the agency, Bloomberg reported, retains that material for decades (even if no wrongdoing is found).3. The FBI had possession of emails sent by Nidal Hasan saying he wanted to kill his fellow soldiers to protect the Taliban   but didn t intervene, leading many critics to argue the tragedy that resulted in the death of 31 Americans at Fort Hood could have been prevented.4. During the Obama Administration, the FBI claimed that two private jets were being used primarily for counterterrorism, when in fact they were mostly being used for Eric Holder and Robert Mueller s business and personal travel.5. When the FBI demanded Apple create a  backdoor  that would allow law enforcement agencies to unlock the cell phones of various suspects, the company refused, sparking a battle between the feds and America s biggest tech company. What makes this incident indicative of Comey s questionable management of the agency is that a) The FBI jumped the gun, as they were indeed ultimately able to crack the San Bernardino terrorist s phone, and b) Almost every other major national security figure sided with Apple (from former CIA Director General Petraeus to former CIA Director James Woolsey to former director of the NSA, General Michael Hayden), warning that such a  crack  would inevitably wind up in the wrong hands.6. In 2015, the FBI conducted a controversial raid on a Texas political meeting, finger printing, photographing, and seizing phones from attendees (some in the group believe in restoring Texas as an independent constitutional republic).7. During its investigation into Hillary Clinton s mishandling of classified material, the FBI made an unusual deal in which Clinton aides were both given immunity and allowed to destroy their laptops.8. The father of the radical Islamist who detonated a backpack bomb in New York City in 2016 alerted the FBI to his son s radicalization. The FBI, however, cleared Ahmad Khan Rahami after a brief interview.9. The FBI also investigated the terrorist who killed 49 people and wounded 53 more at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Fla. Despite a more than 10-month investigation of Omar Mateen   during which Mateen admitting lying to agents   the FBI opted against pressing further and closed its case.10. CBS recently reported that when two terrorists sought to kill Americans attending the  Draw Muhammad  event in Garland, Texas, the FBI not only had an understanding an attack was coming, but actually had an undercover agent traveling with the Islamists, Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi. The FBI has refused to comment on why the agent on the scene did not intervene during the attack.Via: Grabien",left-news,"May 9, 2017"

640, Trump Loves To Say The New York Times Is ‘Failing’ – So They Just Effortlessly Embarrassed Him With Simple Numbers,"Print journalism and longstanding papers have been struggling since the advent of the internet and increased competition faced by blogs and op-ed sites. That, combined with poor understanding of marketing on new platforms, has combined to really cause a struggle in the journalism industry.So, on a certain level, journalists can thank Trump. Despite unleashing a war on freedom of the press never before seen in our nation s history, he s been a boon to business, with massive public backlash against Trump and his fake news army resulting in a thirst for facts and information.Take the New York Times, for example. In the first quarter of 2017, the NYT signed on more new subscribers than any other period in history. Stock is up 50 percent. Digital advertising revenue went up nearly 20 percent. So when Donald Trump says  when is the failing NYT going to go out of business,  as he did today, the answer is  not soon.  They ve been around for 160 years and don t look to be going anyplace anytime soon.Here s the specific tweet in question:How much longer will the failing nytimes, with its big losses and massive unfunded liability (and non-existent sources), remain in business?

But he s provided no details on what that plan would look like or how he d handle the millions of people who have obtained insurance under the law.

13577,"BLOODY 4TH OF JULY WEEKEND UPDATE: Obama’s Hometown Of Chicago…64 Shot, 6 Killed, Including 39 Yr Old Father, 3 And 10 Yr Old Daughters…Black Reverend Cautions Those Who Blame Guns or Cops","Just another big city destroyed by Democrats As the nation took to backyard BBQs and paused to celebrate the birth of our nation, the incessant gang warfare in and around the Chicago area continued without a hitch with 37 shootings and six deaths over the three-day weekend. The tragic toll included the death of a 39-year-father and his two young girls in a nearby Chicago suburb.At least 64 people were shot in the nation s third largest city over the Independence Day weekend, including four people who were fatally wounded. The grim violence in Chicago, which has recorded 329 homicides already this year, continued despite stepped up street patrols by the Chicago Police Department and the arrest of 88 gang members in two of the city s most violent neighborhoods ahead of the holiday weekend.Friday was atypical in that the shootings were relatively few and no one died, but the rest of the weekend more than made up for it. Friday featured only five citizens wounded, all in separate incidents.Saturday rang in with a vengeance with 11 shootings and two deaths, while Sunday saw 14 shootings and one death. Sunday also saw an additional three people murdered in a nearby suburb. By Independence Day itself, another four citizens were wounded.One of the most tragic shootings of the holiday weekend was the death of 39-year-old Dionus M. Neely, who was shot and killed along with his ten-year-old and three-year-old daughters, Elle and India.The murders took place in the nearby Chicago suburb of Hazel Crest on Sunday morning just after 2 AM, police report. Anyone who could kill a three-year-old and a ten-year-old, no matter what the circumstances, is nothing but pure evil as far as I m concerned,  Hazel Crest Police Chief Mitchell Davis III said on Sunday afternoon.The long weekend brings the list of violence to 2,008 total Chicagoans shot, and 302 shot and killed, among the total 336 homicides in the Windy City thus far this year.  BreitbartReverend Jesse Lee Peterson has some thoughts on why crime is so high in majority black cities and why Americans need to STOP blaming cops for the fatherless crisis that is plaguing inner city communities.Fatherless homes   combined with the left s policies and attacks on free speech   are creating thugs and cop killers. It s important to shine a light on this anti-cop mentality that has so contaminated America s inner cities.   The underlying cause of all this of course? Young black men growing up without fathers.Progressives of all colors have intimidated most white Americans with the  R  word (racist), and now whites rarely comment on black criminality. These same progressives are perpetuating the fatherlessness and anti-police attitude that is wreaking havoc on America s inner cities.Many blacks today have a serious issue with authority figures. This problem starts in the home and manifests itself as early as preschool.A Department of Education study found that blacks make up 18 percent of all preschool children, but they account for 42 percent of suspensions.Education Secretary Arne Duncan blamed the problem on  racial disparities,  and was  stunned that we were suspending and expelling 4 years olds.  Duncan is more  stunned  by the disciplinary action of the schools than he is by the rotten behavior of the kids. No surprise. Rotten kids are anti-authority   so are progressives.Attorney General Eric Holder said a  zero-tolerance  approach eventually leads many students into the criminal justice system and promised to end the  school-to-prison pipeline.  In other words, according to Holder, disciplining bad kids is creating a path to prison! This is progressive  wisdom. Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, the NAACP, the Congressional Black Caucus and other leftist black  leaders  have been excusing black criminals and stoking hatred toward police for decades.The 1992 Los Angeles riots, sparked by the police beating of Rodney King, resulted in the deaths of 60 people. But Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., didn t call it a riot; she called it a  rebellion. The rap music industry has long promoted violence toward cops. The most notorious perpetrators include: N.W.A. (Niggaz with Attitudes) with their  F  tha Police  lyrics, rapper ICE-T s  Cop Killer  album, and Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg s  187  (about murdering cops). Video games like  Grand Theft Auto  also reinforce anti-police attitudes.Progressive mayors are allowing thugs and cop haters to flourish in our cities.Leftist NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio ended previous Mayor Rudy Giuliani s successful  stop, question, and frisk  program after complaints that it unfairly targeted minorities, and now violent crime has skyrocketed.According to CompStat figures, 129 people were shot last month   a 43 percent increase over the same period last year.In  Chicagoland,  progressive policies and fatherlessness have created  killing fields.  The recent Independence Day massacre, where 82 shootings resulted in 15 people killed, doesn t help the city s image.Instead of aggressively going after Chicago s gangs, Obama former Chief of Staff and now Mayor Rahm Emanuel is focused on the guns, even though Chicago has some of the nation s toughest gun-control laws.Progressives have created an environment that rewards irresponsibility and dependency. Sending welfare payments to single women with children has resulted in the decline of black marriages. Today, 73 percent of black kids are born out of wedlock.Since most black fathers are not around, these children never develop respect for authority. In fact, they grow to hate the impatience and pressure their mothers put on them.Recently I interviewed Paul Raeburn, author of  Do Fathers Matter?  Here are just a few of his findings:  When fathers are absent during mother s pregnancy, the baby is more likely to be born prematurely. The baby is four times as likely to die in the first year.  If the man is depressed, the child is eight times as likely to have behavior problems and 36 times as likely to have difficulty getting along with peers.   Kids with dads around are less likely to become  bullies : Oxford researchers said when fathers were absent, children had higher rates of aggressive behavior.Obviously the missing link to end the cycle of violence and the anti-police attitude in the black community is to rebuild black families. Progressive policies of providing financial incentives for single mothers who have kids out of wedlock must end.Progressives also bully people into not speaking truth about moral cause and effect. They re not just immoral   they are  anti-moral. Yet, Americans   especially white Americans   have to start speaking out about the anti-authority mindset destroying our inner cities. If whites and blacks allow the lawlessness to continue, the chaos and anti-cop violence will spread everywhere. And when police are not safe   no one is safe. Via: WND ",politics,"Jul 5, 2016"
22164,"BEYOND MISSION CREEP: U.S. Planning to Send 1,000 More Ground Troops into Syria"," Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireJust as 21WIRE reported last week   the US mainstream media are still black-balling any substantial reporting about US boots on the ground in Syria. Instead, America s media are obsessing over Trump s tax returns, various Russian conspiracy theories, and Michael Flynn s Moscow public speaking engagement in 2015. With this latest Pentagon announcement of an additional 1,000 US troops to Syria, that would bring the total combat deployment to approximately 4,000 inside of Syria.Considering the amount of media coverage and political debate over the 5,000 US military personnel send to Iraq over the last 3 years   one must ask why the silence in US media about the stealth build-up for a major battle in Raqqa, Syria.Previously, 21WIRE reported how the United States has sent in combat troops to support YPG fighters (Kurdish People s Protect Units in Syria)   much to the dismay of Turkey, and to the annoyance of both Russian and Syrian planners. Turkey has been pressing the US to change its strategy for fighting Islamic State in Syria by abandoning the YPG whom it deems as terrorists (in league with the Kurdish PKK in Turkey).The other aspect of this is being ignored by western media and their legion of panel  experts . There are a number of rival factions and militias being backed by the US besides the Syrian Democratic Forces (comprised of Kurdish YPG). the US-led Coalition have substantial investments in Sunni extremist (terrorist) fighting groups allied under the Al Nusra (al Qaeda in Syria) umbrella. Consider how back in late 2015, the US deployed 5o US Special Forces in Syria as  human shields    arguably to salvage its  rebels assets being ravaged by Russian airstrikes.After the Coalition s epic loss when Al Nusra-led brigades were driven out of terrorist stronghold in East Aleppo, one must ask if there an element of this in US positioning around Manbij and Raqqa?With so many stakeholders, the margin for error is extremely thin. The situation is fraught with risks for all parties. NOTE: This is taking place amid a political storm in Washington   as the entire Democratic Party, half the Republican Party and the whole of the US mainstream media are all trying to bring down the Trump Administration. If Raqqa is deemed a success, it will effectively give Trump a win. If it is deemed a disaster, then it will be used to fuel the anti-Trump resistance in the US. If the White House is too desperate for a win, then the prospect of a mistake or miscalculation becomes ever riskier. If a major world war is to be triggered   it could very well happen here. Clearly, the US and others are planning a massive operation to lay siege to Raqqa, the ISIS stronghold in Syria. However, if the other similar allied operation in Mosul, Iraq is anything to go by, then expect massive civilian  casualties in this battle too. The civilian carnage has been mostly censored from mainstream in the US and Europe, the  Coalition  are afraid of the negative public relations backlash in the event that western public received too much negative news about the haphazard operation in Mosul.  After early reports of massive civilian casualties in late 2016, it seems that the Pentagon have given the order to mainstream editorial desks to back off on negative reporting. How else can we explain how hundreds, and possibly thousands, of civilians killed in this month alone   has managed to escape any and all media scrutiny?To underline this matter, yesterday, Human Rights Watch issued two new reports accusing Iraqi troops of using indiscriminate shelling into civilian areas in the fight to liberate Mosul from ISIS control.Based these recent reports, it s becoming more clear that US-led Coalition is sacrificing civilians in their objective to target ISIS fighters.To make matters worse, ISIS, like Al Nusra terrorists in Aleppo, have been using Mosul civilians as human shields. The only difference in this comparison is that western media were condemning the Syrian and Russian militaries for their anti-terror operations in Aleppo, while giving a free pass to clear US Coalition atrocities against civilians in Mosul.Forget about any word from the US State Dept. either   as they run point on the cover-up: The other conversation which has been deemed off limits by US and western media   is the fact that this US deployment inside of Syria is completely illegal under every international law, as well as in total violation of the US Constitution. US were not invited by the Syrian government   therefore, like its fellow NATO member Turkey, the US has effectively invaded Syria.US involvement in Syria is now way past mission creep.More on more US troops in Syria from the Washington Post .  . Thomas Gibbons-Neff Washington PostThe U.S. military has drawn up early plans that would deploy up to 1,000 more troops into northern Syria in the coming weeks, expanding the American presence in the country ahead of the offensive on the Islamic State s de facto capital of Raqqa, according to U.S. defense officials familiar with the matter.The deployment, if approved by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and President Trump, would potentially double the number of U.S. forces in Syria and increase the potential for direct U.S. combat involvement in a conflict that has been characterized by confusion and competing priorities among disparate forces.Trump, who charged former president Barack Obama with being weak on Syria, gave the Pentagon 30 days to prepare a new plan to counter the Islamic State, and Mattis submitted a broad outline to the White House at the end of February. Gen. Joseph Votel, head of U.S. Central Command, has been filling in more details for that outline, including by how much to increase the U.S. ground presence in Syria. Votel is set to forward his recommendations to Mattis by the end of the month, and the Pentagon secretary is likely to sign off on them, according to a defense official familiar with the deliberations.While the new contingent of U.S. troops would initially not play a combat role, they would be entering an increasingly complex and dangerous battlefield. In recent weeks, U.S. Army Rangers have been sent to the city of Manbij west of Raqqa to deter Russian, Turkish and Syrian opposition forces all operating in the area, while a Marine artillery battery recently deployed near Raqqa has already come under fire, according to a defense official with direct knowledge of their operations.The moves would also mark a departure from the Obama administration, which resisted committing more ground troops to Syria.The implementation of the proposed plan, however, relies on a number of variables that have yet to be determined, including how much to arm Kurdish and Arab troops on the ground, and what part regional actors, such as Turkey, might have in the Raqqa campaign Continue this story at The Washington PostREAD MORE SYRIA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Syria FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",US_News,"March 17, 2017"

The stories of at least 2 of his accusers have been unraveling after non-mainstream media uncovered that one of the anti-Trump accusers worked for Hillary and openly promoted Moore s Democrat opponent on her Facebook page. The mother of another accuser is challenging the truth behind the Washington Post s hit story as well.Curiously, the person who sent the tweet that Keurig responded to is none other than Angelo Carusone, the president of GEORGE SOROS  Media Matters of America. Here is Carusone s  tweet to Keurig.Angelo, thank you for your concern and for bringing this to our attention. We worked with our media partner and FOX news to stop our ad from airing during the Sean Hannity Show.

16357,DID HILLARY REALLY THINK She’d Get Away With Telling Big Fat Lie About Obama’s “Red Line” Comment?,"It s not a big surprise given her propensity for lying, but when Hillary knew she was getting destroyed by Trump on her ineffective, embarrassing record as Secretary of State, she lied about not being Obama s Secretary of State during his ridiculous  red line  comment During Sunday night s presidential debate, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton denied that she was in office as Secretary of State when President Barack Obama refused to punish Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad for using chemical weapons against civilians after calling chemical weapons use a  red line  which could not be crossed. They had a chance to do something with Syria, and that was the line,  Republican nominee Donald Trump said of his Democratic rival and the administration in which she worked.  You were there as Secretary of State with the so-called  line in the sand. No, I wasn t, I was gone,  Clinton replied.President Obama delivered his famous  red line  speech   in which he described the use of chemical weapons against civilians by Assad as a  red line  that Assad could not cross without suffering serious international consequences   in August 2012. We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus,  President Obama said at the time.Hillary Clinton served President Obama as Secretary of State from January 21, 2009 to February 1, 2013, according to the State Department. She was not in office when Assad used chemical weapons yet again in 2015, violating international law. The White House did not respond to Assad with any direct military retaliation.

In a normal world, our president would be holding a press conference to tell people they will be held accountable for their actions.

4384, LEAKED AUDIO: Trump Picked Miss USA Contestants Based On DISGUSTING ‘Trump Rule’,"In new leaked audio that will make your skin crawl, Donald Trump s incredible misogyny is clearly displayed.When the Republican nominee bought the Miss USA contest he instituted a rule he calls the  Trump rule  in which he and his staff line all of the contestants up so that he can ogle them up close and only pick the most beautiful women to compete in the pageant.First, Trump lines up the women and starts dividing them based on their looks. At one point in the audio Trump remarks that women in West Virginia don t know what cellulite is, a backhanded comment meant to fat-shame women who don t meet his personal standards.He also asked contestants to choose contestants they think are pretty enough to compete for the Miss USA title, essentially allowing certain contestants to judge the others. Thus, the women were divided into groups based on which women made Trump horny.Trump went on to complain to the women about how the judges were supposedly judging the contest wrong and that the most beautiful women were left backstage instead of being picked to win.While Trump is obsessed with the women s looks, the contest has not been just about who is the prettiest. Personality is also judged.But Trump thinks only looks matter, so he and his team inspected the women and jotted down notes on a pad of paper about each one. So if a woman had a mole that Trump didn t like, it was more than likely marked down and used against her in the judging.Here s the audio via The Daily Beast:This is about as creepy as it gets, and as Raw Story points out, confirms what former Miss USA 2009 runner-up Carrie Prejean wrote in her book about Trump. Prejean described the experience of Trump looking over the girls as  humiliating. We were told to put on our opening number outfits   they were nearly as revealing as our swimsuits   and line up for him on stage,  she wrote.  Donald Trump walked out with his entourage and inspected us closer than any general ever inspected a platoon. He would stop in front of a girl, look her up and down, and say,  Hmmm.  Then he would go on and do the same thing to the next girl. He took notes in a little pad as he went along. Many of the girls found this exercise humiliating. Some of the girls were sobbing backstage after he left, devastated to have failed even before the competition really began to impress  The Donald. Donald Trump is a creep who doesn t deserve a single vote from any woman in America. As Bill Maher noted during his show on Friday, the only concrete position Trump has taken throughout his campaign is  no fat chicks.  It s a cruel and creepy policy Trump has held his entire life and he should be punished for it in November. He and the Republican Party need to learn that women come in all shapes and size and that women are sick of the bullshit way they are treated by them.Featured Image: Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images",News,"October 3, 2016"

14058,GRIFTER HILLARY CLINTON WAS PAID For Speeches Given To Government Contractors…No Ethics!,"A new report tells us what we already knew about Hillary s speeches government contractors paid Clinton big bucks for speeches opening a conflict of interest up that calls into question the ethics of the woman who wants to be our next president  Grifters like the Clintons don t care much for ethics though so this will be spun by the mean stream media and her supporters. Pitiful! WASHINGTON (AP)   It s not just Wall Street banks. Most companies and groups that paid Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to speak between 2013 and 2015 have lobbied federal agencies in recent years, and more than one-third are government contractors, an Associated Press review has found. Their interests are sprawling and would follow Clinton to the White House should she win election this fall.The AP s review of federal records, regulatory filings and correspondence showed that almost all the 82 corporations, trade associations and other groups that paid for or sponsored Clinton s speeches have actively sought to sway the government   lobbying, bidding for contracts, commenting on federal policy and in some cases contacting State Department officials or Clinton herself during her tenure as secretary of state.Presidents are not generally bound by many of the ethics and conflict-of-interest regulations that apply to non-elected executive branch officials, although they are subject to laws covering related conduct, such as bribery and illegal gratuities. Clinton s 94 paid appearances over two years on the speech circuit leave her open to scrutiny over decisions she would make in the White House or influence that may affect the interests of her speech sponsors.Via: AP",politics,"Apr 23, 2016"
2812," ‘Calexit’ Is Really A Thing, Might Mean Actual Secession (DETAILS)","California has had a movement going for the last couple of  years that is pushing for the large, deep blue state to leave the union. This state has long been the leader of progressive policies and movements, and with the election of Donald Trump and his supporting regressive federal government, it is looking more and more like California just might be fed up enough to leave the United States permanently.The movement is led by the Yes California Independence campaign, and they have been given the green light to begin collecting signatures to get on the ballot. Thanks to the fact that the Trump administration wants to take America back to the dark ages where people of color are more disenfranchised than ever, where LGBTQ people are subjected to abuses like conversion therapy and routinely discriminated against, where women have no reproductive rights   well, let s just say the idea just got a whole hell of a lot less far-fetched. It s not a stretch to believe that the majority of Californians do not want to live under the tyranny of Trump and Pence and the GOP Congress.The green light is a sign that this could really happen. Yes California has 180 days to rack up 585,407 signatures to be on the ballot in time for the 2018 election. If they get this passed via the voters, there will be another election specifically to decide whether or not California wishes to be its own country. In that instance the state would repeal the part of the state constitution that says that the United States Constitution is the  supreme law of the land,   as well as law codifying California as an  inseparable part of the United States. On the one hand, this sounds like some kind of liberal utopia, and if it were to happen, I d personally be there in a heartbeat. On the other hand, the remaining parts of the United States would be subjected to Christofascist GOP rule for the rest of eternity, because California is a key state when it comes to delivering Democratic victories in presidential races, with its 55 electoral votes. Further, it could lead to a Brexit-like breakdown of the United States, which could spell trouble for democracy at large, with the break-up of countries like the United States and alliances like the European Union. This could be a world-destabilizing force.Either way, it could be interesting to watch, and one must wonder how a huge state like California, which has the world s sixth largest economy, would be stopped from leaving the GOP-infested hellhole that Trump and Pence are sure to turn America into in short order.Featured image via KTLA",News,"January 28, 2017"
23221,CIA GATEKEEPER? CNN’s Chris Cuomo says Americans are ‘criminals’ for reading WikiLeaks’ Clinton email dump," 21st Century Wire says CNN s Chris Cuomo (image, above) is certainly one of America s most maligned and gaff-prone mainstream media pundits. But are these really gaffs, or is there more to this media operative?This week, Cuomo went into full establishment mode, by attempting to scare the American public into NOT viewing Wikileaks emails online.Cuomo declared this week,  Also interesting is remember, it s illegal to possess, ah, the stolen documents   it s different for the media. So everything you re learning about this, you re learning from us. After Cuomo s fatal misstep, he quickly began back-pedaling and obfuscating his troubling position regarding public access to items that are in the public interest:What is even more disturbing about Cuomo s off-hand legal declarations here, is that he is doing so in defense of Hillary Clinton s presidential run   whose numerous scandals are pervasive throughout the Wikileaks emails. This is hardly the role of a  journalist. NEWSFLASH FOR CNN: If the leaked documents are about elected and appointed public officials (especially those seeking the presidency), and the content exposes illegal and unethical activities   and is clearly in the public interest (which these emails are)   then any decent journalist worth their salt (no such thing at CNN) would publish them and even encourage the public to comb over the documents, unless the media outlet in question functions as a gatekeeper (which CNN does). SEE ALSO: Congressman Jim Jordan stops CNN gatekeeper Chris Cuomo on Benghazi cover-upAs the son of former New York governor Mario Cuomo, and the brother of New York governor Andrew Cuomo, Chris is part of a political dynasty family and member of an elite establishment. It s doubtful he would ve been given such a prominent position in a major broadcast network if he wasn t part of that establishment.Last year, 21WIRE ran a scathing report criticizing CNN s Cuomo over his reliance on dubious ISIS and al Qaeda  online magazines  for his news  breaking news  reports. After a bomb brought down a Russian Metrojet Airbus A321 leaving Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, Cuomo cited an ISIS Monthly  aka DABIQ Magazine claiming that a  Schweppes Bomb  brought down the airliner.21WIRE tweeted the CNN host our critique and in response, Chris Cuomo then blocked @21WIRE from viewing his Twitter page:For a self-described  journalist  hosting a major broadcast TV network program, is Cuomo so insecure that he blocked a small independent news site for criticizing a CNN report  which relies on ISIS as its source?Q: Is Chris Cuomo a media gatekeeper?

It is well documented that the CIA has a number of media infiltration and propaganda programs, including Operation Mockingbird.Is Cuomo participating in such a program, in this case, being run out of CNN?*** SEE ALSO: CNN s New  Source  is ISIS Magazine   Claims a  Schweppes Bomb  Brought Down Russian AirlinerREAD MORE WIKILEAKS NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Wikileaks Files ",Middle-east,"October 20, 2016"

This week, while promoting her new book,  The Secrets of My Life,  she admitted that while she is a Republican and voted for President Donald Trump she is not happy with all of the president s policies and actions.Jenner spoke to a packed audience at the 92nd Street Y Community Center in New York this week. She says that she is looking into where her voice can be heard the loudest and how she can do the most to impact her community. She says that she does not regret voting for the president but she is not thrilled with everything has done. In the past she has said that she is a Republican because she supports  the Constitution and limited government. While she says that she has no regrets about voting for the president, Jenner admits,  As far as LGBT issues, yes, he s made some mistakes. I don t support him in everything that he does. But we needed to shake the system up. At the same time, Jenner said,  My loyalties are not with Donald Trump. I will come after him and come after Republicans if they come after my community. I ve got a voice and they better listen, OK? I will come after them. When a member of the audience asked if she had any plans to run for elected office, Jenner replied,  Would I be better working from the inside? If that is the case   I would seriously look at a run. It just depends where I could be more effective. Some people know Jenner from her time as Bruce when she won multiple gold medals in the Olympics during the 1970s. Younger generations know her from the show  Keeping Up with the Kardashians.  Viewers watched her before her transformation, through the process and then after. The family has not responded well to her new book.Before she told the world that she was transgender, Jenner thought she had  too many skeletons  in her closet. Now that the world knows about that, she says,  Now, I have no more secrets.

8604," Skip The Flowers, Just Don’t Vote For Trump, Asks PA Man’s Obituary","Jeffrey Cohen was a man who believed The meaning of life is  OOPS!'  according to his obituary. The 70-year-old Pennsylvania man passed away Sunday morning at his childhood home in Squirrel Hill, a suburb of Pittsburgh. He was a person who  took pride in being the only Jewish cowboy that he knew of,  and an accomplished chiropractor   one who treated Gold Medal-winning Olympians, members of the Pittsburgh Ballet, professional boxers, and many of the Pittsburgh Steelers throughout his career. Even  Weird Al  Yankovich stopped by to see him.He is described as  compassionate and kind    someone who would  always put others before himself, happily and without hesitation.  His love of dirty and  groan-inducing  jokes was legendary. He also has one final request of those who love him and all who read his obituary   don t f*ck up the next election, or at least do some good in the world:Jeffrey would ask that in lieu of flowers, please do not vote for Donald Trump. (Also acceptable   donations to the Nimmo Educational Foundation   www.nimmoed.org   or a charity of your choice .)That s right   to honor his memory, Cohen asks one simple thing: Don t vote for Trump. Don t throw away our future.His obituary does not indicate whom he would choose as president, but he doesn t want people to vote for someone who would ban Muslims from entering the United States, throw them into concentration camps (after forcing them to register in a national database and wear special badges, of course), or any of the multitude of horrific ideas the brain-gerbils that reside beneath his hairpiece suggest. Cohen doesn t want a  big beautiful wall  running the length of our (southern) border, nor does he want someone who would allow Sarah Palin to speak.This request is the opposite of an obituary request that popped up earlier this month when a Virginia man asked,  in lieu of flowers please vote for Donald Trump.  The billionaire tweeted the obituary, declaring thanking the deceased man and declaring him to be  a great person.  It seems as though Cohen made this request as a light-hearted retort to the Trump fan s suggestion that Americans vote for someone who would later be endorsed by Sarah Palin.Thank you so much.

3919, Bill Maher Has A DIRE Election Message The Whole Country Should Listen To (VIDEO),"We are now down to the wire in the all-important and hotly contested 2016 election. Everyone has crawled into their corners, and in this most bizarre and contentious year, we re all ready to end it already. People have lost friends, relationships have ended the tone of this campaign has been good for no one. That is all due to one man s toxic rise to the top of the GOP presidential ticket: Donald Trump.There s one thing that we all need to remember, though: This was no accident. Trump is a classic demagogue. He has brought out the worst in the entire country, has appealed to people s deepest, basest levels of prejudice, hate, and fear. He s made those of us who are minorities feel especially vulnerable, because we know what is really at stake here. Well, comedian Bill Maher has a very important message regarding all of this   and especially the rise of Donald Trump   no matter which side of the political aisle you fall on.Maher, like most liberals, has spent years excoriating the GOP for their bigotry, lack of belief in science, religious fanaticism, war- mongering, and fantasy economic proposals. However, he says he was wrong. Men like Mitt Romney and John McCain were nowhere near as dangerous as Trump. To that end, he had this to say the the nation on Friday night s edition of his HBO program Real Time: So I ve heard these young people on the news they say things like Donald Trump I don t like him but Hillary, I can t vote for a liar. First of all, it s just apples, and oranges   and orange. After those opening lines, Maher got uncharacteristically grave and serious, saying: This is different. I promise it, this will not make your life better. And also, once fascists get power, they don t give it up. You ve got President Trump for life. I know liberals made a big mistake because we attacked your boy [George W.] Bush like he was the end of the world, and he wasn t. And Mitt Romney we attacked that way. I gave Obama a million dollars because I was so afraid of Mitt Romney. Maher then went on to offer olive branches to Republicans, while giving a warning about Trump: They were honorable men who we disagreed with and we should have kept it that way. So we cried wolf and that was wrong. But this is real. This is going to be way different. Bill Maher is right. Donald Trump is a dangerous demagogue. He s a literal fascist who has shown that he cares not about the Constitution, civil liberties, or any of the things we  have come to take for granted as Americans. Trump is Hitler-level dangerous. Just like they treated the last Fuhrer as a clown and a buffoon prior to his rise, just as establishment types thought they could control him and use him as a puppet to get him elected   so is the same with Trump. Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.America   don t make Germany s mistakes. This man is not who you think he is. I promise, we ll all live to regret it if we elect him.Watch Bill Maher s all too correct warning below:[ad3media campaign= 1311 ]Featured image via video screen capture ",News,"November 6, 2016"
7359, This 19 Second Video Of Trump Shows Why Democrats Should Not Support Israel (VIDEO),"Like all other presidents since George H.W. Bush   President Obama has worked to build a closer relationship with Israel while still pushing them publicly to stop the development of their  Jews only  settlements that have all but made a 2 state solution impossible. The progressives in the Democratic party have pushed for accountability with Israel due to its horrific human rights violations against the Palestinians, which rules over them and denies them the most basic of human rights in the West Bank and Gaza. Yet, despite the billions of dollars of tax payer money we give but can t afford to give to Israel, politicians are tripping over each other to grovel to the American Israel Public Affairs committee (AIPAC), the powerful pro-Israel lobby group that can make or break a political career.That s why all the political candidates lined up to speak at the AIPAC conference yesterday (minus the only Jewish candidate   Bernie Sanders) to see who can kiss Israel s a** the best; each of the Republican presidential candidates using Israel as a cudgel to hammer President Obama for not sufficiently bowing to the needs of the Israel first   AIPAC conference.It was quite embarrassing to watch American leaders grovel to a group whose sole reason for being is to push the interests of a foreign country. Out of all of the pandering and ass kissing that happened at AIPAC   there was one moment that brought a long ovation from the crowd. And this one moment really encapsulates the sense of entitlement for Israel.Trump s best line:  with President Obama in his final year, yay! And the crowd erupts. One would think there was a Rosh Hashanah celebration with the kind of applause heard in the crowd, but alas   it was a group of right wing Americans applauding President Obama being in his final year in office.Because from their vantage point   President Obama is secretly trying to destroy Israel. Despite the billions of dollars sent each year, the diplomatic cover the president has provided Israel at the United Nations for its war crimes and apartheid state   they hate him. Despite the years of partisanship by Prime Minister Netanyahu   where he inserted himself into the 2012 Presidential election to help Mitt Romney or the multiple years of public defiance over international agreements on the Iran peace deal having brokered a deal with the Republican party to speak to Congress behind President Obama s back   they blame him.AIPAC is upset because of the president s deal with Iran over its nuclear weapons and would rather see America s kids go to war on Israel s behalf than have the diplomatic solution the president was able to broker, which the great majority of US military leaders have called a good deal.

7160, So Much For Outreach: Black Staffers Are Jumping Ship From The RNC,"When Republicans examined why they lost the 2012 Presidential Election, leadership concluded that they needed better outreach to groups such as women and African-Americans. And it s not going well.As it turns out, the Republican National Committee began by hiring some black employees to head up the outreach program in order to bring more black voters to the party.But as Donald Trump soars in popularity among white supremacists and gets ever closer to capturing the Republican nomination, the national director of African-American Initiatives at the RNC appears to have decided to throw in the towel on that effort to work for Maryland Governor Larry Hogan instead.In a statement to Huffington Post, Kristal Quarker-Hartsfield failed to mention why she chose to leave the RNC, saying only that she enjoyed her time working there and praised Reince Priebus as a good leader. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at the RNC. she said. It has been an honor to work for Chairman Priebus during an exciting time in politics. It has been exciting to have a front row seat to a national Republican movement to maintain the House and win back the Senate. Chairman Priebus is an innovative leader who empowers his team, and serves my Party as a humble servant leader. It could merely be a coincidence that Quarker-Hartsfield just happens to be abandoning her post at a time when it s likely the racist Trump has destroyed just about every effort the GOP has tried to attract minority voters.But when you consider that three other black staffers have jumped ship over the last few months, it becomes less of a coincidence and more of a sign.Huffington Post reports:Quarker-Hartsfield joins several other staffers of color who have departed the RNC recently. Orlando Watson, communications director for black media, left earlier this month. Tara Wall and Raffi Williams, son of Fox News political analyst Juan Williams, both left their press positions at the RNC late last year.Though Williams denies that he left the RNC because of Trump or the racist rhetoric that has taken over the GOP, one can t help but wonder if it bothers him and the other black staffers on any level.Clearly, the RNC is experiencing problems reaching out to minority voters and Trump is making that effort even more difficult as Hispanics, women, African-Americans, and Muslims have all been targeted by Trump supporters and Trump s nasty rhetoric.It certainly appears that with Trump in the lead, some black staffers at the RNC just didn t want to waste their time trying to reach out to voters because it is kinda hard to convince minority voters that your party isn t racist when a racist has been all but crowned as the Republican nominee. It also makes one wonder how these staffers could be Republicans in the first place. Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 1, 2016"
10059,AMERICAN-MADE CONFEDERATE FLAG FACTORY Sees A Huge Change In Sales After Charlottesville,"You d think people would be afraid to order a Confederate flag after the riot in Charlottesville BUT this Alabama flag factory is seeing a huge jump in sales The story of how this single flag manufacturer was started and has flourished is bittersweet ALABAMA FLAG & BANNER SALES SURGE!Sales of Confederate flags surged at Alabama Flag & Banner, which may be the only company still manufacturing the flags in the United States. Belinda Kennedy, the owner, sees the flag as a historical symbol.Rebel flag sales are up since Charlottesville. One north Alabama shop may be the only flag manufacturer in America meeting the increased demand.Alabama Flag & Banner is located in a small strip near downtown Huntsville. Two years ago, the company began manufacturing the Confederate flag after retailers pulled it from their shelves in the wake of the mass shooting at the Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, S.C. in which nine people were killed by a white supremacist who d been photographed holding a Confederate flag.The country s major flag manufacturers stopped producing rebel flags. Eventually, said longtime owner Belinda Kennedy, Alabama Flag & Banner became the go-to manufacturer for hundreds of retailers across the country looking to stock American-made Confederate flags. Online orders boomed, too.Two weeks ago, after the deadly Charlottesville rally sparked a national debate about whether Confederate monuments should be removed from parks around the country, flag sales spiked again. After the church shooting (in 2015), Amazon and Walmart stopped selling (the flag) and people were afraid they wouldn t be able to buy it,  she said.  And then you started seeing streets renamed, schools being renamed, mountains being renamed. And then people started getting angry. And then there s another surge (in sales). Since 2015, Alabama Flag & Banner has sold an average of 600-800 Confederate flags a year. Before that, they typically made a handful of special orders per year because they were able to order flags from a larger manufacturer.Kennedy said there are now Chinese-made flags available elsewhere, and she s seen a handful of individuals online who hand-sew flags to order, but as far as she knows her business is the only one in the country currently manufacturing Confederate flags.About half of the Confederate flags at her shop are a more labor-intensive appliqued flag which retails for anywhere from $93 to upwards of $200. The rest are a less expensive screen-printed flag, which costs $38.50 for a 3  x 5  flag. Everybody s got a different reason (for buying),  she said.  By and large, I think people are afraid they may not be able to get it one day. Confederate flags represent only a fraction of her business, she said, and she has not needed to hire any extra help so far. She has a team of seven or eight seamstresses, some of them Hispanic, who work on the manufacturing side, hand-stitching appliqued flags and preparing the screen-printed flags.Downstairs in Kennedy s office is a double-frame picture of two of her great-great-grandfathers, who fought for the South in the Civil War. I think there is a bigger racial divide in our country than what we ve had in many years,  said Kennedy.  I think a lot of it is (because) we re trying to sanitize history. You ve got white supremacists, but then you ve got people like me who are history buffs, pushing back and saying, don t change history. Removing Confederate monuments is not right, she said. She echoed President Donald Trump s remarks about the Charlottesville violence, asking where the country should draw the line at removing monuments because founding fathers like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson owned slaves.The Confederate flag, in her view, has been co-opted for something it doesn t represent. She hated seeing it carried by white supremacists in Charlottesville. When you ve got people like the Ku Klux Klan and these neo-Nazi groups, the white supremacists, when they hijack the flag, that should be a crime,  she said,  because that s not what the flag is about. But that s what makes people so vehemently, adamantly opposed to the flag. Since 2015, Kennedy has been no stranger to attention, though she said she dislikes most of the publicity and news coverage surrounding the Confederate flag. Outlets such as CNN and Yahoo News have already interviewed Kennedy this week as part of coverage of the monument debate.A self-avowed Daughter of the Confederacy, Kennedy does not see herself as a crusader for the Confederate cause. But she doesn t accept that the flag   or monuments, for that matter   are anything more than a symbol of heritage or history. When we start trying to rewrite our history, we are forgetting our history,  she said.  Does anybody really think by taking down monuments and renaming mountains and taking down Confederate flags, that we are really going to see racism end? That s not going to fix it.Read more: AL.com",politics,"Aug 23, 2017"

We wish we knew the name of the jackhole reporter who asked the question!

4032, WATCH: Anderson Cooper And Ana Navarro NAIL Hypocrite Newt Gingrich To The Wall,"Newt Gingrich must really be regretting his little temper tantrum on Megyn Kelly s show now.Because his tirade about Kelly being more  fascinated  with sex than policy really has backfired spectacularly in the last 24 hours, culminating in a brutal takedown on CNN.All Megyn Kelly did was correctly point out that Donald Trump is possibly a sexual predator, which caused Gingrich to explode in rage and be completely disrespectful towards Kelly.Anderson Cooper and his panel discussed the former House Speaker s hissy fit on CNN on Wednesday night, and it didn t take long for Gingrich to be slammed for being a total hypocrite because of his past sexual misconduct.Cooper fired the first shot by calling it  ironic  that Gingrich would call Kelly  fascinated by sex  when he cheated on his first two wives, including an affair that took place during the impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton. For Newt Gingrich to accuse Megyn Kelly of being fascinated by sex,  Cooper said after turning to Trump supporter Scottie Nell Hughes for a response.  This is a guy, who s what, on his third marriage, cheated on his first two wives and was having an affair when he was impeaching Bill Clinton. Isn t that right? Hughes used the  glass houses  defense and tried to turn the discussion into one about Hillary Clinton.Needless to say, Hughes and fellow Trump supporter Kayleigh McEnany humiliated themselves by trying to defend Gingrich s offensive outburst.But GOP consultant Ana Navarro had no problem blasting Gingrich, and she corrected Cooper before proceeding to rip Gingrich a new one. I think the word you were looking for was  hypocritical.  Remember Newt Gingrich s wife? When he was running in 2012, told all of us, told the media, said it to the camera. Newt Gingrich offered her the choice between an open marriage or a divorce. So maybe, just maybe, if all of that baggage is on your shoulders, maybe you shouldn t be the surrogate out there wagging your finger and accusing the woman who was reporting on sexual assault   let me explain it slowly   sexual assault and sex are two things. One is unwanted. One is wanted. So maybe they need to understand that to begin with. Let us not confuse sexual assault and sex. And if you are going to get a surrogate to speak on it, and wag his finger on national TV, maybe, just maybe, go find the Pope or somebody that s been on his knees in a chapel for the last 20 years. Not Newt Gingrich. Here s the video via YouTube.Gingrich should publicly apologize to Megyn Kelly for his behavior on Tuesday night. It was unacceptable and only demonstrated precisely why Trump is getting hammered at the polls by women right now. Scottie Nell Hughes should tell Gingrich all about glass houses next time she sees him because he certainly could have used that advice before making a jackass out of himself. Or better yet, Gingrich should just keep his mouth shut and disappear from the political landscape entirely.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 27, 2016"
10436,NEW BOMBSHELL REPORT Shows DNC Emails Were Copied On East Coast ONLY 5 DAYS Before SETH RICH Murder…Disproves Russian Hacking Theory,"DNC staffer Seth Rich was shot in the back several times while walking home late at night, when he was only blocks from his home. Rich was on the phone with his fianc  when he was shot and left for dead. Seth Rich was hired by the Democrat Party as the official  voter expansion data director.  Although there is no confirmed connection yet, he was clearly privy to information that could potentially harm the Democratic Party, and more specifically Hillary Clinton s chances of winning the election in November. Although the DC Police Department ruled the crime a  botched robbery,  nothing was stolen from Rich after he was shot. Many believe that Rich was the person who copied the DNC emails and sent them to Wikileaks via a middle-man. Was Guccifer 2.0 the middle man?Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has strongly hinted that the source for the DNC emails he released was Seth Rich. In this interview with Julian Assange, he seems to suggest on Dutch television program Nieuwsuur that Seth Rich was the source for the Wikileaks-exposed DNC emails and was murdered:On August 9, 2016, Assange offered  a $20K reward for information leading to the conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich. ANNOUNCE: WikiLeaks has decided to issue a US$20k reward for information leading to conviction for the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich.  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) August 9, 2016The report shows the DNC files were copied only 5 days before the unsolved cold-blooded murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich. h/t GPOn Sept. 13, 2016, POLITICO reported on Guccifer 2.0 s alleged hack into the DNC servers:If authentic, the documents would represent the latest strike from the mysterious hacker persona that has already roiled the 2016 election with leaks of documents stolen from the DNC and the House Democrat s campaign arm, the DCCC. Earlier document dumps include the internal communications that forced the resignation of former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz this summer and fueled allegations of party bias against Bernie Sanders.The following statement from FBI Director James Comey seems to back up the assertion that Guccifer 2.0 was not the hacker. Comie testified to Congress that it was the assessment of the FBI that,  hostile actors gained access to the private commercial email accounts of people with whom Secretary Clinton was in regular contact from her personal account.  (like Seth Rich?)According to Fox News   In May, 2016, Guccifer repeatedly claimed to Fox News during a series of interviews that he had successfully breached Clinton s private server. Guccifer made the same claims to NBC News, which published his claims later.In July, when FBI Director James Comey was asked about this claim before Congress, he testified,  He did not [gain access to Clinton s server], he admitted that was a lie. Guccifer 2.0 was arrested and extradited to Romania where he is currently serving time for hacking offenses. In communication from jail, Guccifer 2.0 adamantly refuted the claim that he is Russian or tied to the Russian government via The Hill: I really hope you ve missed me a lot. Though I see they didn t let you forget my name. The U.S. intelligence agencies have published several reports of late claiming I have ties with Russia,  reads the post. I d like to make it clear enough that these accusations are unfounded. I have totally no relation to the Russian government. Guccifer told Fox and NBC News that he breached Clinton s server, but in his May 2016 interview, when pressed by the FBI, Guccifer said the claims were not true. Here are a few key highlights from the bombshell report by The Forensicator that backs up Guccifer 2.0 s claim to FOX and NBC in 2016 that he did NOT hack the DNC emails and offers evidence that the emails were hacked locally (by Seth Rich?) and that the data was copied on a  fairly slow USB flash drive:This study analyzes the file metadata found in a 7zip archive file, 7dc58-ngp-van.7z, attributed to the Guccifer 2.0 persona. For an in depth analysis of various aspects of the controversy surrounding Guccifer 2.0, refer to Adam Carter s blog, Guccifer 2.0: Game Over.Based on the analysis that is detailed below, the following key findings are presented: On 7/5/2016 at approximately 6:45 PM Eastern time, someone copied the data that eventually appears on the  NGP VAN  7zip file (the subject of this analysis). This 7zip file was published by a persona named Guccifer 2, two months later on September 13, 2016. Due to the estimated speed of transfer (23 MB/s) calculated in this study, it is unlikely that this initial data transfer could have been done remotely over the Internet. The initial copying activity was likely done from a computer system that had direct access to the data. By  direct access  we mean that the individual who was collecting the data either had physical access to the computer where the data was stored, or the data was copied over a local high speed network (LAN). They may have copied a much larger collection of data than the data present in the NGP VAN 7zip. This larger collection of data may have been as large as 19 GB. In that scenario the NGP VAN 7zip file represents only 1/10th of the total amount of material taken. This initial copying activity was done on a system where Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) settings were in force. Most likely, the computer used to initially copy the data was located somewhere on the East Coast. The .rar files and plain files that eventually end up in the  NGP VAN  7zip file disclosed by Guccifer 2.0 on 9/13/2016 were likely first copied to a USB flash drive, which served as the source data for the final 7zip file. There is no information to determine when or where the final 7zip file was built.Here are a few key conclusions from the report:Conclusion 6: The initial DNC file collection activity began at approximately 2016-07-05 18:39:02 EDT and ended at 2016-07-05 18:53:17 EDT. This conclusion is supported by the observed last modified times and the earlier conclusion that the ex-filtrated files were copied to a computer located in the Eastern Time zone.Conclusion 7: A transfer rate of 23 MB/s is estimated for this initial file collection operation. This transfer rate can be achieved when files are copied over a LAN, but this rate is too fast to support the hypothesis that the DNC data was initially copied over the Internet (esp. to Romania). This transfer rate can also be achieved when copying directly from a computer s hard drive to a fairly slow USB flash drive; there is a lot variability in USB flash drive speeds. We can shorten this statement and say that the 23 MB/s transfer rate supports the conclusion that the files were initially copied locally and not over the Internet.For an in depth analysis of various aspects of the controversy surrounding Guccifer 2.0, refer to Adam Carter s blog, Guccifer 2.0: Game Over.Here is an excerpt from Guccifer 2.0 s What Happened and When Did It Happen timeline: A lot of people are concerned if I have any links to special services and Russia?I ll tell you that everything I do I do at my own risk. This is my personal project and I m proud of it. Yes, I risk my life. But I know it s worth it. No one knew about me several weeks ago. Nowadays the whole world s talking about me. It s really cool!How can I prove this is true? I really don t know. It seems the guys from CrowdStrike and the DNC would say I m a Russian bear even if I were a catholic nun in fact. At first I was annoyed and disappointed. But now I realize they have nothing else to say. There s no other way to justify their incompetence and failure. It s much easier for them to accuse powerful foreign special services. They just f*cked up! They can prove nothing! All I hear is blah-blah-blah, unfounded theories and somebody s estimates.Specialists from Eastern Europe, Russia, China, India work for the leading IT-companies such as Google, IBM, Microsoft, Apple. There s no surprise that many hackers are descendants from these regions.Almost all recent famous hacker attacks have been attributed to Russia. the researchers supposed that the same instruments were implemented during the attacks. But I d like to reveal a secret to all those cool IT-specialists: all the hackers in the world use almost the same tools. You can buy them or simply find on the web.This line in Guccifer 2.0 s message is very interesting and extremely plausible:Guccifer 2.0 timeline.

CEO Mark Fields responded to Trump s criticism in a recent interview with CNN s Poppy Harlow. He said Ford is committed to adding jobs in the U.S.Last July, Trump blasted Ford for having manufacturing operations in Mexico.  What does that do? We don t get anything. Does Mexico come here and build factories here? We lose a fortune with every deal  that adds jobs overseas, Trump claimed.Fields defended Ford s track record on supporting American jobs.  We ve created 25,000 jobs [in the U.S.] since 2011, and going forward over the next four years we ve agreed to either retain or add another 8,500 jobs,  Fields said.  The amount of money that we invest in [research and development] here is more than companies like Apple. Ford invested nearly $7 billion in R&D in the U.S. in 2014 alone, Field said.The Republican presidential frontrunner s criticism of Ford largely centered around Ford s plans to invest $2.5 billion in its Mexican operations.Then in October, Trump took credit for Ford supposedly canceling those plans and opening a new factory in Ohio instead.In fact, Ford said it planned to go forward with its $2.5 billion expansion in Mexico.

16605,"PUTIN Threatens To Release 20,000 “Top Secret” Emails From Hillary…Why Judge Napolitano Says This Is Very Bad News For Hillary [VIDEO]","Putin may be the one person Obama has absolutely no influence over. With Obama unable to use his Chicago thug-like political tactics on Putin, could this finally be the end of Hillary Clinton s career in politics? Hillary Clinton sits at the center of a raging firestorm concerning her arrangement of a private email account and server set up in her home   from which top secret information may have been deleted. But despite Bernie Sanders  apparent annoyance with the  damn emails,  the scandal just exponentially intensified, when Judge Andrew Napolitano revealed on Monday that Russia has possession of around 20,000 of Clinton s emails   leaving open the possibility her deletions might not have been permanent after all. There s a debate going on in the Kremlin between the Foreign Ministry and the Intelligence Services about whether they should release the 20,000 of Mrs. Clinton s emails that they have hacked into,  Napolitano told Fox News  Megyn Kelly in an interview for The Kelly File.https://youtu.be/oounggTI-jkWith Clinton s repeated claims she employed the personal email server only for mundane communications and non-sensitive State matters having been proven outright lies, the deletions of 31,830 emails   in the new context of Napolitano s statement   have suddenly become remarkably relevant.As the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton s questionable email practices deepens, the question of who had access to what information previously located on the former secretary of state s server is now more critical than ever.One such individual, Romanian hacker Guccifer, who was abruptly extradited to the United States, revealed he had easily and repeatedly accessed Clinton s personal server   and he wasn t the only one. For me, it was easy,  the hacker, whose given name is Marcel Lehel Lazar, exclusively told Fox News;  easy for me, for everybody. If Guccifer and Napolitano are right, Russia may, indeed, have possession of highly-sensitive information courtesy of Clinton s arrogant failure to adhere to the obligation to use a government email account during her tenure as secretary   a situation worsened by the now-mendacious claim no sensitive information had been sent through the personal account.In fact, if Guccifer is to be believed   as his extradition by the U.S. indicates   news of the Kremlin having obtained potentially top-secret material may be the tip of a gargantuan iceberg. Using a readily available program, the Romanian hacker also claimed he observed  up to 10, like, IPs from other parts of the world  during sessions on Clinton s personal server. If just one of those unknown parties was connected to Russia, who the other nine might be could be central to the FBI s decision whether or not to charge Clinton for mishandling classified information.Adding yet another nail in the coffin case against Hillary on Thursday, the Hill reported conservative watchdog Judicial Watch revealed, pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request, frustration with technical difficulties in obtaining a secure phone line led the secretary to direct a top aide to abandon the effort and call her without the necessary security in place.

9922,Nasty Liberal Lawyer Just Got A Dose Of Karma After Saying He’d ‘Be Ok’ If Female Trump Official Was Sexually Assaulted,"Texas Civil Rights lawyer, Rob Ranco made a really bad move last Friday evening when he took to twitter to make a disgusting comment about Betsy DeVos:  I m not wishing for it  but I d be ok if #BetsyDevos was sexually assaulted.

Luckily, the tweet was captured before he deleted it.Ranco had more to say to Education Secretary DeVos:  Make the world more dangerous for my daughters   intentionally   and your well being is not my concern. Full stop. Ranco was responding to DeVos  reversal of an OBAMA policy that intervened in local school procedures by imposing un-American, unfair, and downright scary  rules  that automatically ruin the lives of male college students so long as any wack job nut accuses him of something. Kangeroo college  tribunals  railroad these people. That was OBAMA s doing.

That is too much for denizens of the modern MSM to tolerate.On today s Reliable Sources on CNN, Schieffer reported the glaringly obvious truth: that President Trump gave a good speech in Saudi Arabia today.

16192,WATCH: TED CRUZ SKEWERS DEMS for Hypocritical Questioning of Supreme Court Nominee [Video], ,Government News,"Mar 21, 2017"
8100, What Ted Cruz Said In Church Sounds Like Sharia Law For America (VIDEO),"Presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) visited a South Carolina church on Sunday and in a message broadcast to several other houses of worship, made an argument for a government based on the principles of the religious far right, rather than the American Constitution.Echoing Middle Eastern extremists who believe that the law of God trumps existing laws, Cruz told the crowd what they wanted to hear about where a candidate like himself would take America.Cruz, an avowed evangelical, made his case in front of a packed house of nearly 2,000 churchgoers.His sermon, titled  Faith in Action,  pressed a range of conservative hot buttons, from religious liberty to abortion rights to the Second Amendment.Cruz warned that a  radical   left-wing majority  on the Supreme Court could result in  unlimited abortions on demand across this country   with taxpayer funding and no parental notification. He called the high court s decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide  fundamentally illegitimate, lawless, unconstitutional and wrong. Cruz has previously demonstrated that he believes religious faith trumps the law of the land, with his support for rogue clerk Kim Davis in Kentucky. Cruz was among the woman s most vocal supporters as she refused to grant marriage certificates for same-sex couples, even after the Supreme Court had ruled that same-sex marriages were legal in all fifty states and the District of Columbia.Over his campaign, Cruz has tried to appeal to the faction of conservative Republican voters who have a view of the role of government that is similar to Middle Eastern  sharia,  where religious texts and beliefs have more sway than the written rule of law. Cruz found success, when those voters backed him in the Iowa caucus and led to victory for his campaign. He had a setback with New Hampshire s less religious and more independent primary voters, where he finished in third place. Cruz is hoping that more religious extremist voters in South Carolina will allow him to regain the momentum he may have lost.Featured image via YouTube",News,"February 15, 2016"
1710, Sean Hannity Loses His Sh*t After Getting His Ass Handed To Him By New York Times Writers,"It s time for Sean Hannity to join Bill O Reilly in the unemployment line.On Saturday, the New York Times published an article reporting that Donald Trump gets policy advise from Sean Hannity among many others outside the White House. Sean Hannity tells the president that keeping promises on core Republican issues is crucial Presidents always deploy surrogates to appear on television to spout their talking points, but Mr. Trump has expanded on that by developing relationships with sympathetic media figures like Mr. Hannity who also serve as advisers. Mr. Hannity, the Fox News host, defends Mr. Trump s most controversial behavior in public, but privately, according to people close to Mr. Trump, he urges the president not to get distracted, and advises him to focus on keeping pledges like repealing the Affordable Care Act. Indeed, Hannity served as Trump s chief propagandist during the 2016 campaign and often did interviews with Hannity in order to get the kid gloves treatment.Of course, Hannity had a complete meltdown on Twitter over the article and proceeded to accuse the New York Times of  colluding  with Hillary Clinton and referred to them as  fake news,  which is something Trump would do.@nytimes You colluded with HRC in 2016. It s none of your business who i do or do not talk too. Total fake news speculation about me/@POTUS  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 22, 2017Hannity even accused the Times of spying on his private conversations.@nytimes Any conversation I have with ANYONE is supposed to be PRIVATE. I have NEVER talked to you. Was I surveilled and unmasked by u/NSA?  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 22, 2017That s when several New York Times writers jumped in to defend their publication.Maggie Haberman fired back by informing Hannity that sourced cited him as a person Trump talks to for advise and further informed Hannity that Fox News did not object to the story when the New York Times reached out to the network.W all due respect, we were interested in who POTUS talks to, not you, and several ppl close to him cited you https://t.co/sb9y4nDJYt  Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) April 22, 2017Also reached out to Fox News pr, who took no issue w it. And it was hardly critical of you. Not sure why the reax https://t.co/sb9y4nDJYt  Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) April 22, 2017Hannity then claimed that he doesn t talk to the New York Times and said that he doubts Trump does either.The @nytimes has no clue who I talk to as I refuse to EVER TALK TO THEM! @POTUS knows you are FAKE NEWS and I doubt he talks to u either.  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 22, 2017But he s wrong. It turns out Trump has done two in-depth interviews with the New York Times in the last month.Then Glenn Thrush chimed in.I was once sitting with a Republican elected official preparing for an interview when he got an email from u giving him political advice https://t.co/lhn4UFQn7I  Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) April 22, 2017Apparently, Hannity forgot about that. He also forgot that he has, indeed, spoken with the New York Times and Nick Corasaniti was kind enough to provide a link to the interview.Here s an interview I did with Sean last year: https://t.co/uUMU1yGcoe https://t.co/QzNFgNxSMi  Nick Corasaniti (@NYTnickc) April 22, 2017Yeah, that has to be embarrassing.Anyway, the night passed and Hannity was apparently still pissed off so he imploded on Sunday morning in a series of tweets directed at the trio of writers.Maggie have you ever publicly commented on how @wikileaks revealed the @nytimes colluded with HRC? And then hired @GlennThrush also exposed https://t.co/xPLZpLLzy6  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) April 23, 2017Maggie, why should people ever accept  several people close to him  as a source, especially when you never contacted me.

13847,TRUMP COMES OUT SWINGING: New Ad Features One Of Bill’s Rape Victims…With Surprise Ending [VIDEO],"Bill s gonna wish his corrupt wife never ran for President by the time Trump is finished exposing this family of grifters. This is more than just about Trump winning, it s about Trump doing the job the media should have been doing to expose Hillary Clinton as an accomplice to her perverted husband for decades Fresh from using the  R  word during a recent sit-down with Sean Hannity, Donald Trump on Monday released on Instagram a new campaign ad against Hillary Clinton featuring the voice of Bill Clinton s rape accuser, Juanita Broaddrick. He starts to bite on my top lip and I try to pull away from him,  Broaddrick is heard saying in the brief ad. Bill Clinton can be seen in the background with a cigar in his mouth.Watch here:Is Hillary really protecting women?A video posted by Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on May 23, 2016 at 8:27am PDTYou gotta love the cackle at the end The Broaddrick audio comes from an emotional interview that she gave to NBC s Dateline in 1999 describing the alleged rape.Broaddrick says Clinton raped her at a hotel when she was a nursing home administrator volunteering for then-Arkansas Attorney General Bill Clinton s 1978 gubernatorial bid.She told NBC s Dateline that she resisted when Clinton suddenly kissed her:Then he tries to kiss me again. And the second time he tries to kiss me he starts biting my lip   He starts to, um, bite on my top lip and I tried to pull away from him. And then he forces me down on the bed. And I just was very frightened, and I tried to get away from him and I told him  No,  that I didn t want this to happen but he wouldn t listen to me.   It was a real panicky, panicky situation. I was even to the point where I was getting very noisy, you know, yelling to  Please stop.  And that s when he pressed down on my right shoulder and he would bite my lip.   When everything was over with, he got up and straightened himself, and I was crying at the moment and he walks to the door, and calmly puts on his sunglasses. And before he goes out the door he says  You better get some ice on that.  And he turned and went out the door. In an interview with this reporter last week, Broaddrick was asked to comment on the statements made by Trump at a campaign stop earlier this month, where the presidential candidate slammed Hillary Clinton as  unbelievably nasty, mean enabler  who  destroyed  the lives of her husband s mistresses and alleged victims.Broaddrick replied:  I feel like she has been the enabler behind him in allowing him to continue on the same path that he did back in the  70s and  80s and  90s. He has absolutely no morals when it comes to women. Via: Breitbart News",politics,"May 23, 2016"
3877, Lindsey Graham Sends A Final ‘F*** You’ To Trump As He Announces Who He Voted For (TWEETS),"This election has been hard for South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham. After fighting his little Republican heart out in the primaries only to see a reality TV star defeat him and every other more qualified GOPer, Graham continued to be devastated long after Trump became the Republican nominee.Graham s journey through Trump s campaign has been nothing short of an emotional roller coaster, starting with him trashing The Donald and refusing to keep his promise to support the party s nominee regardless of who it was. Then, Graham eventually decided to support Trump after much hesitance, only to completely disown him in the end after one too many offensive statements and erratic stunts. Needless to say, Graham is probably one of the most relieved people in the GOP that this election has finally come to an end.On Tuesday, Graham decided to celebrate Election Day with one more final  F*ck You  to Trump, someone that Graham clearly doesn t think deserves to be anywhere near the White House. Using his hatred for Trump as the inspiration behind his voting choice, Graham announced who he actually voted for on Twitter, and it s going to break Trump s little black heart:TwitterTwitterTwitterGraham decided that since he can t stand the thought of voting for Trump but didn t want to vote for Hillary Clinton, either, that he would just vote for the next best thing in his mind   Evan McMullin, who came into the election late with the simple goal of being an alternative to Trump.Graham is the very first senator to publicly say that he s voting for the conservative independent candidate, and it s a huge slap in the face to Trump. We expect that many more disgruntled Republicans will be making similar choices, although many may not have the courage to actually admit it.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla and Alex Wong / Getty Images",News,"November 9, 2016"
4322, David Letterman Calls For ‘Damaged’ Donald Trump To Get A Psychological Exam,"David Letterman may be retired but his opinion about Donald Trump still carries a lot of weight, especially when you consider that he has interviewed him many times over the years.In an interview with the New York Times, the legendary comedian who formerly hosted The Late Show talked about the Republican nominee and how the two used to interact on the program whenever Trump was a guest. Nobody took him seriously, and people loved him when he would come on the show,  Letterman said.  I would make fun of his hair, I would call him a slumlord, I would make fun of his ties   and he could just take a punch like nothing. He was the perfect guest. That s a complete flip from the Trump the public has seen over the last year and a half. Trump is known for having a thin skin and he often lashes out over the smallest slights against him. Just a simple criticism is enough to send him over the edge, whether it s on Twitter or during his rallies.It was during one such rally when Trump attacked a reporter critical of his campaign by mocking his disability on stage in one of the most disgraceful moments of the 2016 Election season.And it s a moment Letterman says should have disqualified Trump and made him a pariah in our society. I can remember him doing an impression, behind a podium, of a reporter for the New York Times who has a congenital disorder, and then I thought, if this was somebody else   if this was a member of your family or a next-door neighbor, a guy at work   you would immediately distance yourself from that person. And that s what I thought would happen. Because if you can do that in a national forum, that says to me that you are a damaged human being. If you can do that, and not apologize, you re a person to be shunned. Letterman then suggested that Trump is behaving so badly that he should get his head examined. I don t know anything about politics. I don t know anything about trade agreements. I don t know anything about China devaluing the yuan. But if you see somebody who s not behaving like any other human you ve known, that means something. They need an appointment with a psychiatrist. They need a diagnosis and they need a prescription. Indeed, Trump s mental health has been a great concern to many people. Even Dr. Drew and board-certified psychiatrist and Fox pundit Charles Krauthammer have weighed in on the subject.But regardless of why Trump is acting the way he is, the point is that it is far from presidential and should disqualify him from ever holding the office. America does not need a president who is easily provoked, especially when he will have the nuclear codes. We need a president who is good at working with others and has a calm steady hand. That person is not Donald Trump.Featured image via Salon",News,"October 7, 2016"
208, WATCH: George W. Bush Calls Out Trump For Supporting White Supremacy,"Former President George W. Bush gave a speech on Thursday in which he said that  bigotry seems emboldened  in the U.S. and warned that Americans need to reject  white supremacy.  This is the speech that Trump should have given even before the Nazi march in Charlottesville. Donald Trump was backed by every white supremacist group across the board during his divisive campaign. Although Bush pointed to the  governing class,  he did not mention the former reality show star s name, but it was obvious that he was talking about Trump, his policies, and his base.Bush spoke of our  discourse being degraded by casual cruelty.  He continued to say that we ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism  and added that  we need to recover and recall our own identity. Discontent deepened and sharpened partisan conflicts  in recent years, Bush said in remarks from New York City at a forum focused on security and sponsored by the George W. Bush Institute. Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seem more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication,  the former President continued.Bush also warned against  a new era of cyber threats  including Russia s attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election, a thing which Donald Trump has called a hoax. Ultimately this assault won t succeed, but foreign aggressions including cyber attacks, disinformation, and financial influence should never be downplayed or tolerated,  he said. Bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed,  Bush continued.The Hill reports:Bush, who advocates free trade, promoted multilateral and bilateral trade deals during his presidency. Trump is now demanding that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico be renegotiated, under the threat of a U.S. withdrawal. We cannot wish globalization away,  Bush said, then he went on to urge society to  adapt  to economic and social change.Bush went on to warn that democracies face  new and serious threats  today.Economic, political and national security challenges  proliferate,  he said. And they re made worse by the tendency to turn inward,  he said.  The health of the Democratic spirit itself is at issue and the renewal of that spirit is the urgent task at hand. Our governing class has often been paralyzed in the face of obvious and pressing needs. The American dream of upward mobility seems out of reach for some who feel left behind in a changing economy,  he added.Watch:President George W Bush in NYC:  We ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism we need to recall and recover our own identity  pic.twitter.com/dsiSkFzEVp  Pat Ward (@WardDPatrick) October 19, 2017While Bush wasn t a great president, he wasn t an evil man (his vice-president was a doozy, though).

22637,"‘Vote All You Want, The Secret Government Won’t Change.’","21st Century Wire says Those who pull the strings behind the curtain will be a lot harder to get rid of than the puppets which they control.Watch a video of this report here:Tufts University political scientist Michael J. Glennon gave a strong warning to the American people back in 2014 that you can vote all you want   but the Secret Government won t change.Glennon s argument is that a small clique of so-called national security experts, who might otherwise be called elites from the military industrial complex, are always influencing policy makers and over-emphasising security threats.Currently, the only candidate posing a real threat to these elites appears to be Donald Trump, who is claiming he wants  to get along with foreign countries , particularly Russia.But, what is the main reason why we cannot fix this problem? Glennon says it s  the pervasive political ignorance on the part of the American people .Here are the key questions and responses from the interview:What evidence exists for saying America has a double government?GLENNON: I was curious why a president such as Barack Obama would embrace the very same national security and counterterrorism policies that he campaigned eloquently against. Why would that president continue those same policies in case after case after case? Why would policy makers hand over the national-security keys to unelected officials?GLENNON: It hasn t been a conscious decision. Members of Congress are generalists and need to defer to experts within the national security realm, as elsewhere. They are particularly concerned about being caught out on a limb having made a wrong judgment about national security and tend, therefore, to defer to experts, who tend to exaggerate threats. The courts similarly tend to defer to the expertise of the network that defines national security policy.Isn t this just another way of saying that big bureaucracies are difficult to change?GLENNON: It s much more serious than that. These particular bureaucracies don t set truck widths or determine railroad freight rates. They make nerve-center security decisions that in a democracy can be irreversible, that can close down the marketplace of ideas, and can result in some very dire consequences.Couldn t Obama s national-security decisions just result from the difference in vantage point between being a campaigner and being the commander-in-chief, responsible for 320 million lives?GLENNON: There is an element of what you described. There is not only one explanation or one cause for the amazing continuity of American national security policy. But obviously there is something else going on when policy after policy after policy all continue virtually the same way that they were in the George W. Bush administration.This isn t how we re taught to think of the American political system.GLENNON: I think the American people are deluded to believe that the institutions that provide the public face actually set American national security policy. They believe that when they vote for a president or member of Congress or succeed in bringing a case before the courts, that policy is going to change. Now, there are many counter-examples in which these branches do affect policy. But the larger picture is still true policy by and large in the national security realm is made by the concealed institutions.Do we have any hope of fixing the problem?GLENNON: The ultimate problem is the pervasive political ignorance on the part of the American people. And indifference to the threat that is emerging from these concealed institutions. That is where the energy for reform has to come from: the American people. Not from government. Government is very much the problem here. The people have to take the bull by the horns. And that s a very difficult thing to do, because the ignorance is in many ways rational. There is very little profit to be had in learning about, and being active about, problems that you can t affect, policies that you can t change.Read Mark Glennon s 2014 epic Op Ed from the Boston Globe here GET THE FULL STORY ON THE 2016 ELECTION: 21st Century Wire Election Files",US_News,"March 9, 2016"
7639, Obama Just Got A Little More Than Pissed At Those Claiming He’s Soft On Wall Street,"When President Obama took office in January of 2009, the United States of America was on the brink of utter economic collapse. Jobs were being lost at the rate of 750K per month, but have made consistent gains throughout all of Obama s tenure as Commander-in-Chief. Part of bringing us back from the worst recession since the Great Depression included several Wall Street reforms and a Credit Card Bill of Rights.Clearly, we ve come along way from the financial crisis that took place from 2007-2009, and sure, we have a long way to go to ensure that sort of crisis doesn t happen again, but President Obama had some choice words for those who claim he s been soft on Wall Street.On Monday, while standing with Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and several other top regulators, the president stated: I want to emphasize this because it is popular in the media and the political discourse, both on the left and the right, to suggest that the crisis happened and nothing happened. That is not true. I want to dispel the notion that exists both on the left and on the right that somehow, after the crisis, nothing happened. We did not just rebuild this, we rebuilt it better, and we ve rebuilt it stronger. According to Reuters: Obama said regulators appear set by the end of the year to have achieved most of the goals he set out for the financial system in 2008, when he first took office, although he noted there was still work to do on rules for hedge funds and asset managers in what he called the  shadow banking system. He then explained why that work hasn t been done yet: One of our projects is to make sure that we are covering some of those potential gaps. We may need at some point help from Congress to do that. Which is exactly right. In order for those gaps to be filled we need Congress to cooperate, and it s not enough to just blame leadership, we have to hold our Congresspeople accountable. That s why elections, and not just presidential elections, matter so much. Republicans want to weaken regulations and make it possible for the practices that caused the financial crisis to occur, to create a future crisis. If anything, we need to embrace and expand President Obama ideas and goals on Wall Street, not condemn them. He has every right to be mad at those claiming he s done nothing, because that s an outright lie.Featured image: White House flickr",News,"March 7, 2016"
4149, REPORT: Trump Laughed After Woman Was Grabbed ‘By The P*ssy’ On Apprentice Set,"Donald Trump is again under fire from allegations of misbehavior on the topic of sexual conduct on the set of his reality show, The Apprentice. Trump has increasingly been criticized for his actions with women, as they have come forward one-by-one making claims that the Republican presidential nominee forced himself on them.The latest claim, uncovered by The Daily Beast, involves Trump s failure to act.Oscar nominee Gary Busey allegedly sexually assaulted a female Apprentice employee during his time on the show, five Apprentice employees tell The Daily Beast. Donald Trump knew about the incident, laughed it off, and kept Busey on his TV series, these staffers said.Multiple Apprentice employees, including the alleged victim herself, told The Daily Beast that the Academy-Award-nominated actor  grabbed  one of their colleagues  firmly between [the] legs  during the 2011 season of Celebrity Apprentice. Busey also forcibly put the female staffer s hand on the crotch of his pants. The alleged incident, which they say took place during a location shoot in SoHo in New York City, prompted a firestorm among members of the Apprentice crew.The report comes as the Trump campaign has begun a public relations offensive featuring Trump s current wife, Melania. She appeared on several outlets and claimed that the women coming forward to accuse her husband were all lying. Melania Trump also claimed that the audio tape in which Trump joked about sexually assaulting women was simply a matter of the 59-year-old Trump acting like a  boy  and being egged on by Access Hollywood host Billy Bush.Newly released polls show that a majority of woman voters do not take such a charitable view of Trump s actions, and instead are overwhelmingly choosing Hillary Clinton as their candidate. Clinton is even winning a plurality of support with married women, previously a weak spot for Democratic candidates.Featured image via YouTube",News,"October 17, 2016"
6433, Ann Coulter: Trump Doesn’t Need GOP’s Support – ‘He IS The Party’ (VIDEO),"Conservative columnist Ann Coulter took her vomit-inducing support of Donald Trump onto MSNBC yesterday to argue that the presumptive Republican nominee shouldn t even bother trying to convince prominent GOPers like House Speaker Paul Ryan to support him. She said it was a complete waste of the business mogul s time because he pretty much owns the GOP and represents the  heart and soul  of the Republican party now.As the discussion about Trump s Thursday meeting with Ryan was being discussed, host Chris Matthews wondered what might actually convince Ryan to support a presidential candidate that he was clearly having reservations about   and who could blame him?! Coulter shrugged this off and laughed, asserting her opinion that Trump was only having this meeting with Ryan out of the goodness of his heart. Coulter told Matthews: It shows that Trump is being unbelievably gracious. He doesn t need to have this meeting [with Paul Ryan]. He is the party. He is the heart and soul of the party. Pointing out just how incredibly  gracious  this stunt by Trump is, she told Matthews that he could have just said,  hope he comes aboard, we re gonna have a lot of fun, but if he doesn t, oh well  after Ryan withheld his endorsement.To make Coulter s appearance on the show even more outrageous, she made sure to promote her new book, In Trump We Trust. She said that in the future, she hoped that Trump wouldn t waste any more of his precious time convincing the GOP to back him. The people are with him, and there s no point in meeting with all these generals without armies. According to Ryan, his meeting with Trump will be centered around  how to unify the Republican Party.  Ryan said: It s been a bitter and divisive primary. It s going to take more than one week just to repair and unify this party. Apparently, Trump thinks he s got this one in the bag.TwitterFeatured image is a screenshot",News,"May 11, 2016"

3111, RNC Mouthpiece Launches Petty Whinefest; Escalates Trump’s Feud With The Media,"Sean Spicer is the former communications man for the Republican National Committee. He will also be joining the communications team for the upcoming Trump Administration, and he is getting a head start by stoking the fires of Trump s ongoing feud with the press. Speaking with The Hill, Spicer whined about how the media treats Trump. He began: There s some positive aspects here and there, but largely it still continues to not treat him with the respect that he deserves. I think for a lot of folks inside the beltway, and inside pundit-world, they don t fully appreciate the understanding that he has of where the American people are. They continue to mock him in ways, when it frankly just shows the lack of understanding that they have of where the American people are and what they think. Spicer then went on to whine about the positive coverage of Democrats in the press, saying: There are countless examples of the media engaging   overtly or covertly   cheering on Democrats and there s no accountability. But it s also not even frowned upon. The thing is, though, the press realizes what the Republican Party doesn t, which is that Trump is a petty, vengeful, lying, unqualified, corrupt Russian stooge who has duped just enough Americans in the right states to be elected president. That does not mean that he is deserving of respect, though. In fact, respect is earned, not given, and Trump has shown the media zero respect. Rightfully, they are giving it back in kind. He has not earned their respect, and therefore should not expect them to roll over and give it to him.Spicer then went on to give the press another reason to be frustrated with Trump, saying that the White House press briefings that they   and the American people   have become so accustomed to might not be the same in a Trump White House: It will be a daily something. When I say  something,  maybe it s a gaggle, maybe it s an on-camera briefing. Maybe we solicit talk radio and regional newspapers to submit questions   because they can t afford to be in Washington   but they still have a question. Maybe we just let the American people submit questions that we read off as well. This is most definitely vague, and when it comes to vague with Team Trump, that is an ominous sign, most likely.Spicer then said that he had spoken with former White House press secretaries, from both major parties, and said of them: Whether Republican or Democrat, every one of these predecessors has been unbelievably generous with their time, counsel and advice. The respect for the institution is one that is shared by all of them. Speaking of former Bill Clinton White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry s saying that perhaps these briefings should no longer be televised, Spicer said: I think his conclusion   his points are right. The second the cameras come on it becomes more of a show than an attempt to be more informative. So, in other words, they want to cut the American people off from knowing the day to day workings of our own government. The talk then turned to Trump s insistence on using Twitter for insults, policy announcements, and everything in between. Many Americans   including Trump s own supporters   believe he needs to stay off Twitter. Spicer, however, scoffed at this notion: I think this is nonsense. I really do. Because at the end of the day the American people want more than anything else is results. And success. And he s delivering already. And I think the American people   the people who have their jobs because of his actions   the taxpayers who have watched him save tax dollars, are appreciative, and I m not too sure they re concerned with the means by which he achieves that. So, in other words, we can look forward to the Tweeter-in-Chief. We already knew that, though. Spicer ended his remarks with words of caution to the press: Journalists and everyone in America has a Constitutional right to express themselves or write what they want to write. But he equally has a right to make sure that the record is set straight, the facts are known, and that people can t just take potshots without being held accountable. So, this war with the media will continue for the next four years. Considering Trump s thin-skinned, vengeful, vindictive nature, this could mean that he and his sycophants use the bully pulpit of the White House to bully journalists and dismantle the First Amendment. Scary times indeed, folks. #RESIST.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"January 8, 2017"
22040,Trump Thanks Putin for Slashing US Embassy Staff: ‘It Cut Our Payroll’,"21st Century Wire says Speaking to reporters from his summer golf retreat in New Jersey, President Donald Trump publicly thanked Russian leader Vladimir Putin for previously ordering the US to slash its embassy staff in Moscow and close two of its storage facilities there. Much to the chagrin of the adversarial media, Trump crowed, that Putin has helped him achieve a  smaller payroll. Last month 21WIRE reported how Russia ordered Washington to remove 755 its 1,200 US embassy staff in Moscow as part of a retaliatory diplomatic tit-for-tat after the US leveled another round of sanctions against Russia. I want to thank him because we re trying to cut down our payroll and as far as I m concerned I m very thankful that he let go of a large number of people,  said Trump.Meanwhile, it emerged this week that FBI special counsel Robert Mueller ordered a pre-dawn raid on former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, seizing personal documents and equipment.Trump told reporters,  They do that very seldom. I was surprised to see it,  and  I thought it was a very strong signal. Sympathising with Manafort s situation, he added that the raid was a  pretty tough stuff. Trump also went on to comment on the North Korea situation and defensed his previous comments against the regime in Pyongyang.Watch the full press conference here: .

12769,WOW! 1996 NYT’s Stunning Article SLAYS First Lady Hillary Clinton…Calls Her A “CONGENITAL LIAR”…”she is in the longtime habit of lying; and she has never been called to account for lying”,"How did we ever get to the point where we would even  consider electing a woman who is the most well-known liar in America? The media has been buzzing since what many consider an inappropriate private conversation that Donald J. Trump had with another man 11 years ago was released. Funny how the media is willing to gloss over a shameful career of a  congenital liar  simply because her last name is Clinton (wife of the former President Bill Clinton who was impeached for lying under oath to a Grand Jury) and because she comes equipped with the right genitatlia   Americans of all political persuasions are coming to the sad realization that our First Lady   a woman of undoubted talents who was a role model for many in her generation   is a congenital liar.Drip by drip, like Whitewater torture, the case is being made that she is compelled to mislead, and to ensnare her subordinates and friends in a web of deceit.1. Remember the story she told about studying The Wall Street Journal to explain her 10,000 percent profit in 1979 commodity trading? We now know that was a lie told to turn aside accusations that as the Governor s wife she profited corruptly, her account being run by a lawyer for state poultry interests through a disreputable broker.She lied for good reason: To admit otherwise would be to confess taking, and paying taxes on, what some think amounted to a $100,000 bribe.2. The abuse of Presidential power known as Travelgate elicited another series of lies. She induced a White House lawyer to assert flatly to investigators that Mrs. Clinton did not order the firing of White House travel aides, who were then harassed by the F.B.I. and Justice Department to justify patronage replacement by Mrs. Clinton s cronies.Now we know, from a memo long concealed from investigators, that there would be  hell to pay  if the furious First Lady s desires were scorned. The career of the lawyer who transmitted Hillary s lie to authorities is now in jeopardy. Again, she lied with good reason: to avoid being identified as a vindictive political power player who used the F.B.I. to ruin the lives of people standing in the way of juicy patronage.3. In the aftermath of the apparent suicide of her former partner and closest confidant, White House Deputy Counsel Vincent Foster, she ordered the overturn of an agreement to allow the Justice Department to examine the files in the dead man s office. Her closest friends and aides, under oath, have been blatantly disremembering this likely obstruction of justice, and may have to pay for supporting Hillary s lie with jail terms.Again, the lying was not irrational. Investigators believe that damning records from the Rose Law Firm, wrongfully kept in Vincent Foster s White House office, were spirited out in the dead of night and hidden from the law for two years   in Hillary s closet, in Web Hubbell s basement before his felony conviction, in the President s secretary s personal files   before some were forced out last week.Why the White House concealment? For good reason: The records show Hillary Clinton was lying when she denied actively representing a criminal enterprise known as the Madison S.& L., and indicate she may have conspired with Web Hubbell s father-in-law to make a sham land deal that cost taxpayers $3 million.Why the belated release of some of the incriminating evidence? Not because it mysteriously turned up in offices previously searched. Certainly not because Hillary Clinton and her new hang-tough White House counsel want to respond fully to lawful subpoenas.One reason for the Friday-night dribble of evidence from the White House is the discovery by the F.B.I. of copies of some of those records elsewhere. When Clinton witnesses are asked about specific items in  lost  records   which investigators have   the White House  finds  its copy and releases it. By concealing the Madison billing records two days beyond the statute of limitations, Hillary evaded a civil suit by bamboozled bank regulators.Another reason for recent revelations is the imminent turning of former aides and partners of Hillary against her; they were willing to cover her lying when it advanced their careers, but are inclined to listen to their own lawyers when faced with perjury indictments.Therefore, ask not  Why didn t she just come clean at the beginning?  She had good reasons to lie; she is in the longtime habit of lying; and she has never been called to account for lying herself or in suborning lying in her aides and friends.No wonder the President is fearful of holding a prime-time press conference. Having been separately deposed by the independent counsel at least twice, the President and First Lady would be well advised to retain separate defense counsel.

21218,GERMAN COURT RULES “Sharia Police” Patrolling City Streets Did NOT Break Law…INSANE Video Shows Muslim Men Patrolling Streets,"These videos are very disturbing. Americans are headed down this path if we don t fight back against the Left who put political correctness before our national security A German court has ruled that Islamists who patrolled a city s streets as  Sharia police  did not break the law and will not be prosecuted.Here is what a Sharia Patrol looks like:Nine were arrested in September 2014 after patrolling streets in Wuppertal, western Germany. They wore bright orange jackets with the words  Sharia police . They told passers-by not to frequent discos, casinos or bars.The court said they had not violated laws on uniforms and public gatherings.Prosecutors have now lodged an appeal.The group of Salafists   ultra-conservative Islamists   included Sven Lau, a preacher whose passport was seized this year after he visited Syria and a photo surfaced, showing him posing on a tank, with a Kalashnikov rifle slung around his neck. He is suspected of trying to recruit Muslims to join jihadists fighting in Syria or Iraq and has spent some time in prison previously. He said he had gone to war-torn Syria in 2013 on a humanitarian mission.Sharia, the revealed, sacred law of Islam, governs all aspects of a Muslim s life.The group s appearance at night in Wuppertal, in the industrial Ruhr region, triggered sharp criticism in Germany. A film of their  patrol  appeared on YouTube:The action was condemned by the Central Council of Muslims in Germany, who said it was  harmful to Muslims .The group also carried notices proclaiming in English a  Sharia Controlled Zone . The notices spelled out prohibitions like those in force in some Gulf Arab countries, outlawing alcohol, drugs, gambling, music and concerts, pornography and prostitution. Activists in the anti-Islam Pegida movement   campaigning to stop immigration to Germany   demonstrated in Wuppertal last year. They have staged regular marches against  the Islamisation of Germany  nationwide. Via: BBC",left-news,"Dec 16, 2015"
17386,[VIDEO] FLASHBACK…MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. ON RIOTS: “We Can’t Win A Violent Revolution”,"Wouldn t it be great if our first  Black  President would make an effort to quell the angry and violent crowds in Baltimore by and asking for calm? Is it too much to ask that he take this opportunity to address our nation and behave like a leader for the entire country and not like a Community Organizer with an agenda? As long as the negro finds himself living every day in a major depression, then every city will sit on a powder keg and will explode over the slightest incident. This is why I have constantly said that riots are socially destructive and self-defeating. After all, the negro ends up on the losing end. We can t win a violent revolution. The persons who end up not being able to get milk for their children are the negros, because things where they have to live are destroyed.

9682,WATCH: FORMER CHILD ACTOR Tried To Call Out Powerful Hollywood Pedophiles on The View…Barbara Walters and Female Co-Host Shamed Him: “You’re damaging an entire industry!”,"Child actor Corey Feldman appeared on The View in 2013 to talk about his book that exposed some of the richest and most powerful people in the business [Hollywood], who are pedophiles that prey on young actors. Corey s brave admission of his experiences in Hollywood should have been treated as a public service announcement for parents who had child actors working in Hollywood, as he was giving them a  heads up  to take the extra steps to protect them. Instead, he was shamed Feldman appeared in a 2103 episode of The View where Barbara Walters and Star Jones went out of their way to discredit and shut him up. I m saying there are people that were the people that did this to both me and Corey [Haim] that are still working. They re still out there, and that are some of the richest most powerful people in this business. Walters tried to interupt, but Feldman continued,  And they do not want me saying what I am saying right now. Walters asked Feldman,  Are you saying they are pedophiles  and that they are still in this business?  Feldman replied,  Yes. Feldman went on to say,  They don t want me here right now. They want me dead! Star Jones quickly jumped in to try to shut Feldman up so he doesn t scare parents who want their kids in the industry.Feldman clarified, that he s just warning parents to  be careful what you wish for. Don t go into it with naivety.  Instead of considering Feldman s warning, that may be of interest to parents who have children in the industry, Walters interrupted him to admonish him,  You re damaging an entire industry! Feldman apologized,  I m sorry. After several years of being shamed by his peers and high-profile women in the industry like Barbara Walters, child actor Corey Feldman may finally find someone who will finally take him seriously, now that Harvey Weinstein has been exposed.Cernovich   The recent exposure of serial sexual predator and Hollywood Democrat kingpin Harvey Weinstein raises, even more, questions than it answers.In a now famous photo, Weinstein can be seen grabbing young actress Emma Watson in a compromising position.While the public controversy currently centers around Weinstein s sexual abuse of power over young women, the question remains   how young were Weinstein s victims?Former child actor Corey Feldman has publicly stated that  I was molested and passed around,  while discussing how in Hollywood adult males in the industry would pass young stars  back and forth to each other.  Feldman revealed that his co-star Corey Haim was raped at 11-years-old.Actor Elijah Wood confirmed Feldman s claims in May 2016, describing Hollywood as a den of  vipers  in an interview, and saying  If you can imagine it, it s probably happened. Wood said he was protected from abuse by his mother, who didn t let him go to Hollywood parties, but he said other young child actors were regularly  preyed upon  by those in power.Wood also compared Hollywood s sexual predators with known pedophile and English TV personality Jimmy Savile. You all grew up with Savile,  Wood said.  Jesus, it must have been devastating. Clearly something major was going on in Hollywood. It was all organized. X-Men director Bryan Singer is among those publicly accused of sexual abuse of young boys in Hollywood.",politics,"Oct 14, 2017"
7375, Christian Evangelist Says Jewish Bernie Sanders Is The Next Hitler (VIDEO),"This pastor s church should be heavily taxed for this kind of political speech.Democratic Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is the first Jewish candidate to win a state primary in American history, pulling off the feat in New Hampshire last month in an incredible upset of Hillary Clinton.The self-described Democratic Socialist has excited crowds across the country with his vow to reign in Wall Street and end income inequality. Sanders is particularly popular with young people who see him as a desperately needed agent of change who can turn the system around and ensure a better future for all Americans.And it s because college students support him that one Christian televangelist is calling Sanders the next Adolf Hitler. You know, the Nazi Germany dictator who ordered the extermination of six million Jews during World War II. Yeah, that Hitler.During a sermon, disgraced pastor Jim Bakker openly compared Sanders to Hitler citing his socialist beliefs and claimed that if he s elected every American will be dead in a year. One of the most popular politicians right now is a socialist   And who is his biggest following? The young people of America, from the colleges. Maybe you understand a little bit what it felt like to live when Hitler was reigning and the church had to sit by and keep watching it and watching until millions, tens of millions   they had to build factories to kill people. All it takes is a couple bombs and all of America will be dead within a year, less than a year, just months. Bakkers audience, of course, consisted of a bunch of easily frightened old conservative white people.Here s the video via YouTube.There are many problems with Bakker s comparison.First of all, while young people are flocking to Sander s campaign, they are doing so on their own volition while Hitler and the Nazi Party actually went into schools to indoctrinate the German youth to get their support.Second, Bernie Sanders is a Democratic Socialist, which is totally different from a National Socialist.As Sanders explained in November, Democratic Socialism  builds on what Franklin Delano Roosevelt said when he fought for guaranteed economic rights for all Americans. And it builds on what Martin Luther King, Jr. said in 1968 when he stated that,  This country has socialism for the rich, and rugged individualism for the poor.  It builds on the success of many other countries around the world that have done a far better job than we have in protecting the needs of their working families, the elderly, the children, the sick and the poor. Indeed, Sanders believes in  economic equality, universal health care, Wall Street reform, universal college education, paid family leave. In addition, Sanders also seeks  political reforms to limit the power of the wealthy so there is  democratic socialism for working families, not just Wall Street, billionaires and large corporations National Socialism, on the other hand, is a brutal and authoritarian fascist ideology practiced by the Nazis and other right-wing groups who believe in a racial hierarchy with whites at the top. Nazis support policies that push national power, demonize intellectualism, subjugate women, punish homosexuality, censor the free press, and are over-obsessed with Christianity among multiple other aspects you can find by clicking here.In NO way does National Socialism apply to Bernie Sanders. Jim Bakker would be thinking of THIS guy:Image via ImgurNeed proof of Trump s fascism? Well, there s the fact that he ll soon have his own version of Hitler s Brownshirts. Then there s the fact that legendary investigative journalist Carl Bernstein explained why Trump is a fascist. There s this excellent comparison made by the Daily Show. And there s the fact that neo-Nazis show up to support Trump at his rallies.Seriously, Jim Bakker is either oblivious to the real fascism being pushed by Trump or he supports Trump and just wants to shift the accusations of fascism to Sanders to protect the Republican front-runner. Either way, Bakker and his church should face steep taxes for engaging in political speech, especially the kind that pushes outright lies.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 21, 2016"

As it turns out, ABC News got it wrong. But no worries, several hours later, they  clarified  how the story should have read ABC News  major report on Michael Flynn and President Trump s direction on reaching out to the Russians has been corrected.

The idea that Howard Schultz believed he could say Starbucks would make hiring 10,000 refugees a priority, while so many Americans are out of work, and it wouldn t harm the Starbucks brand is beyond foolish Howard Schultz, the current CEO of Starbucks, will step down from his role at the giant coffee chain next month.The move comes after his vow to hire thousands refugees in response to President Donald Trump s first travel ban appeared to hurt customer sentiment and dent their sales.Trump supporters have called for a boycott of the chain since January 29, when Schultz vowed to hire 10,000 refugees over five years.Schultz in a letter to employees said the promise of the American Dream was  being called into question  and that  the civility and human rights we have all taken for granted for so long are under attack. He was also a public Clinton supporter and prominent democrat, and even considered as a running mate for the Democratic nominee at one point.Almost immediately consumer perception levels took a hit as measured by YouGov BrandIndex s Buzz score, falling by two-thirds between January 29 and February 13.At the time, analysts at Credit Suisse said the coffee giant s move had a negative impact on recent sales, and could continue to hurt them in the near future.Schultz, with an estimated net worth of $3.1billion, will remain at Starbucks as executive chairman and will focus on strengthening the company s high-end coffee shops.Schultz will be replaced as CEO by Kevin Johnson, Starbucks  chief operating officer, on April 3, 2017, The Seattle Times reported.

The Republican responded: I was affected by it, but I thought we should ve had the same kind of reaction when James Foley was beheaded, when San Bernardino and Paris occurred. That s the kind of reaction I had when those occurred. Really? He can t understand why the news of twenty FIRST-GRADERS being murdered in their classrooms was a little bit more emotional? These children, six-and-seven years old, were itty bitty and each of their bodies had between three and eleven bullets in them; they were literally riddled with bullets. All of the mass shootings we have experienced over the last decade and a half have been horrifying, but this one was especially hard because the majority of the victims were so small. But Paul Ryan can t understand why this particular one makes the president cry. Okay.Ryan wasn t done yet, he went on to say that the president was using gun control as a  distraction : What I think he s trying to do is distract from basically his failed policies I think the president should put as much effort into going after homegrown jihadists and going after terrorist infiltration of our refugee network and going after defeating ISIS as he is in trying to frustrate the law-abiding citizens  Second Amendment rights. This scumbag actually believes that trying to prevent more gun massacres is the president trying to distract from  real  problems. As if keeping our kids alive isn t a big deal. He thinks our time would be better spent going after the mythical ISIS fighters who are hiding among refugees or  homegrown jihadists ? Why? Because going after  law-abiding  citizens like Dylann Roof, Adam Lanza and the hundreds of other white American terrorists we have in this country is tyranny. Seems legit.Ryan opened his mouth and proved to us, once again, why it is so damn important that we get off of our sofas and vote next November. If we sit at home, we are just giving the Gun Nuts of America  license to kill more of our kids and loved ones. We are one of the most powerful countries in the world and we can t even send our children to school and know that they will come back to us.

4679," As World Trade Center Fell, Donald Trump Boasted His Tower Was Now The Biggest In Manhattan","September 11 was arguably the worst day in American history. All Americans were shell-shocked, fearful, and lost in grief and confusion.Well, almost all Americans were grief stricken, except of course Donald Trump. In his typical form, Trump used an unimaginable horror to prop himself up and pat himself on the back.As the World Trade Center collapsed to the ground, Trump, in a by-phone T.V. interview, boasted that his building, 40 Wall Street, was now the tallest building in lower Manhattan.Reporter: You have one of the landmark buildings down in the financial district there, 40 Wall Street   uh   did you have any damage? What s happened down there?Trump: Oh, it s an amazing phone call I made, 40 Wall Street actually was the second tallest building in downtown Manhattan and it was actually before the World Trade Center was the tallest, and when they built the World Trade Center it became known as the second tallest. But now it s the tallest.Congratulations, Trump. As thousands of people lie dead in a mast of rubble and debris, you single handedly turn a national tragedy into praise for yourself and your buildings.Imagine if Hillary Clinton, who was Senator of New York at the time, had said something so incredibly offensive, so devoid of sympathy or empathy for New Yorkers.Of course his supporters   Republicans who exploit 9/11 to draw out our fears   will dismiss this as another liberal character assault. Coupled with his lies about Muslims, the theft of his  charity  for 9/11 survivors, it should come as no surprise that Donald Trump did not care on iota about what happened.Only a egomaniacal narcissist would take the opportunity to plug in his business as being the biggest (and thus the best) as an iconic hallmark of the world crumbles.Watch the exchange for yourself and share it with all your  patriotic  Trump-supporting friends and family.

13916,OBAMA FAN CLUB PRESIDENT GEORGE CLOONEY Tells France: “There’s Not Going To Be A President Trump” [VIDEO],"There s nothing quite like an arrogant actor who lives in Europe, supports Hillary, blames the press for making Trump popular, and for not properly vetting him, while hanging out at the White House with the least vetted President in American history.George Clooney is making his disdain for Donald Trump known not just here in the United States but also overseas.The actor was interviewed by members of the international press at the Cannes Film Festival on Thursday afternoon, and took some time to share with them his opinion of Trump. There s not going to be a President Donald Trump,  said Clooney, who held a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton last month in Los Angeles where tickets reportedly went for $353,400 per couple. That s not going to happen. Fear is not going to be something that drives our country. We re not going to be scared of Muslims or immigrants or women. We re not actually afraid of anything. That whole  We re not afraid of Muslims  thing ought to go over pretty well with the victims and families of victims who have been attacked in Paris twice over the past couple of years. Tell that to French residents who live in or near  no-go-zones  George. Of course, you wouldn t know, because you have the best security detail money can buy hypocrite!Clooney, who was on the Croisette to promote his film Money Monster, went on to say;  Trump is actually a result in many ways of the fact that much of the news programs didn t follow up and ask tough questions.

315, Target Just Made A Major Move That’s Going To Blow Conservative Minds (VIDEO),"Conservatives, who are notoriously anti-labor, are going to be outraged by the move Target just made.Target will be raising their national minimum wage to $15 by 2020, starting with an immediate raise next month. Here s more via Jessica Castro, an anchor for ABC7 out of the Bay Area:#breaking Target will increase its minimum wage nationwide to $15 by 2020; If you work there, this means RAISES next month! #livedesk pic.twitter.com/0BXcHJoBdC  Jessica Castro (@JessicaABC7) September 25, 2017Republicans have repeatedly tried to make the case that raising wages kills jobs and raises prices, but that s not true. Target is making the right call. The current federal minimum wage, at $7.25, is extremely low compared to historic averages when adjusted for inflation.In fact, when you adjust for inflation, the minimum wage has steadily dropped since 1968.Republicans also try to make the case that most minimum wage workers have just entered the workforce and are not supporting families on their income (i.e. are students). This, too, is false. Less than half of minimum wage workers are aged 16-24. Additionally, tens of millions of hardworking Americans are paid nearly minimum wage, and would also be affected by proposed raises. It s not high schoolers with after-school jobs being paid minimum wage   it s anybody working a job at a business that can get away with shifting the burden of its employees to the public.And make no mistake   if you re a taxpayer, you re supporting underpaid employees. People working full-time (or part-time and can t get more hours) who are under the poverty line are eligible for benefits, and many choose to take them, being partial to eating and whatnot. That means if a business isn t paying their employees enough to eat, the government has to subsidize that employee. If a business can t afford a living wage, it has no right to exist.From Pew Research:While the idea of raising the minimum wage is broadly popular, a Pew Research Center survey this past August found clear partisan and racial differences in support. Overall, 52% of people favored increasing the federal minimum to $15 an hour, but that idea was favored by just 21% of Trump supporters (versus 82% of Clinton backers). And while large majorities of blacks and Hispanics supported a $15 federal minimum wage, 54% of whites opposed it.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"September 25, 2017"
16302,GREAT! PRO-COAL OKLAHOMA AG Tapped For Head Of EPA," When the Environmental Protection Agency proposed rules regulating carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, Scott Pruitt sued. When the Justice Department offered legal status to young undocumented immigrants, Scott Pruitt sued. And when the Obama administration sought to give tax credits to states that hadn t set up their own health insurance exchanges, Scott Pruitt sued.Since becoming Oklahoma attorney general in 2010, Pruitt has filed or joined lawsuits against federal agencies at least a dozen times. Even when Oklahoma isn t an actual party in litigation, the state often submits a legal brief against the federal government. Besides air pollution, immigration and health care, Pruitt has fought federal laws and regulations on banking, contraception and endangered species. These days, whenever states go to court against the Obama administration, the chances are that Pruitt is somehow involved.Not that Pruitt is alone. During Obama s presidency, the entire cadre of Republican attorneys general (27 at present) has coordinated cases against federal agencies at an unprecedented pace. But Pruitt is at the center of the action. He has set up a first-in-the-nation  federalism unit,  which seeks to combat instances of federal overreach by every possible means.Read more: Governing",Government News,"Dec 7, 2016"
1122, Bizarre Late Night Statement Proves Deputy AG Is Just Another Water Carrier For Trump,"Donald Trump s administration and White House is the leakiest in living memory. This is because even his own staff knows that he is incompetent, intemperate, childish, narcissistic, and completely unfit for the office he holds. Despite the fact that they all know this, the sycophants around him just keep on doing his bidding   and they keep leaking. These leaks seem to be worrying Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein   or rather, likely Trump s open rage with regards to them has forced Rosenstein s hand.Instead of defending the integrity of Special Counsel Robert Mueller as Trump and his minions have spent the last few days attacking this decorated public servant, Rosenstein instead decided to issue a bizarre statement late Thursday night that shows that he, too, is now shilling for Trump. The statement attacks the credibility of anonymous sources, saying:Americans should exercise caution before accepting as true any stories attributed to anonymous  officials,  particularly when they do not identify the country   let alone the branch of agency of government   with which the alleged sources supposedly are affiliated. Americans should be skeptical about anonymous allegations. The Department of Justice has a long established policy to neither confirm nor deny such allegations.Fired U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara pointed out that Rosenstein should be defending Special Counsel Mueller instead of shilling for Trump:Where is Rod Rosenstein's overdue statement responding to the President's repeated attacks on his appointment of Robert Mueller? pic.twitter.com/y7dwtWTQ4G  Preet Bharara (@PreetBharara) June 16, 2017This is beyond strange. The Department of Justice is not supposed to be politicized, but still the people therein serve at the pleasure of the president. More than likely, Trump ordered Rosenstein to do this, since so many damning stories about the Russia investigation are coming out on an almost hourly basis. Trump is reportedly completely obsessed with the Russia story, and still hasn t let go of the idea of somehow getting rid of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. In fact, the only reason Mueller is still there is because White House aides talked Trump off the ledge when he was about to order his firing.Conservative commentator Bill Kristol has an excellent theory as to what is going on with Rosenstein s behavior, and it s terrible for the nation:The Rosenstein statement suggests there must be a heck of a Trump story coming based on alleged information from anonymous foreign officials  Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) June 16, 2017In the Age of Trump, the independence of the Department of Justice is definitely shot, and this proves it. While it was clear that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was a part of Trump s campaign and one of his staunchest supporters was nothing but a Trump shill, we had all hoped that Sessions  recusal from the Russia investigation and Rosenstein s taking over would give the whole situation a bit more credibility, but no.All I can say is thank goodness for Robert Mueller. Hopefully, firing him would be a bridge too far   even for Congressional Republicans.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"June 16, 2017"

14189,AFTER GM’S TAXPAYER BAILOUT AND $10 BILLION IN FORGIVEN DEBT…Cars Now Made In China [Video],"Was the GM bailout REALLY about American jobs? The taxpayers were sold a bill of goods on the GM bailout and still haven t seen anything but jobs going overseas. The American worker and American taxpayer deserve better!In 2016, General Motors will roll out for the first time in the United States a new model of Buick built exclusively in China: the Buick Envision.It s the first time the iconic American auto manufacturer will sell cars built in China in the United States since receiving a sizable taxpayer-funded bailout at the end of the George W. Bush administration and beginning of the Barack Obama administration.The Buick Envision which was available in China for purchase as far back as 2014 will make its official debut in the United States in the summer of 2016.The Buick Envision bills itself  a luxury crossover designed to turn heads and welcome you in. A quick search of  Buick Envision  leads to the Buick Envision s website where one can explore all the features and design of the vehicle. The website doesn t appear to make any reference to the fact that the Envision is manufactured in China.The issue of U.S. auto manufacturers moving production facilities overseas has taken a center stage this presidential election, with the rise of both billionaire Donald Trump in the Republican Party and of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)16% of Vermont in the Democratic Party.Trump has drawn attention to GM competitor Ford for the company s decision to move manufacturing to Mexico, but Ford wasn t the recipient of a taxpayer-funded bailout. Sanders, meanwhile, has used his opposition to the bailouts to show that he isn t influenced by crony capitalism all while former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has tried to take credit for saving the auto industry with her support of the bailout.Breitbart News reached out to American Jobs Alliance to get its reaction to GM s decision to import Chinese-produced cars.  When the taxpayers bailed out General Motors, we were told it was all about saving jobs in America. Now GM turns around and throws Americans under the wheels of Buicks made in China. Where does it stop? Will General Motors build Cadillacs, Chevys and GMC trucks in China next?  Curtis Ellis executive director American Jobs Alliance told Breitbart News.General Motors has also announced plans to sell a Chinese manufactured hybrid Cadillac, the CT6 in American markets. Flint was known for decades as Buick City. It s now jobless, bankrupt and destitute,  Ellis continued.Read more: Breitbart",politics,"Mar 31, 2016"
6095, Republican Senators Don’t Want Ted Cruz Anywhere Near Their Re-Election Campaigns,"Ted Cruz thinks he could be an asset to the campaigns of his fellow Republican senators. There s just one problem, though: most of them don t like him.Republicans currently face an uphill climb this year, especially with Donald Trump at the top of the 2016 ballot. The nomination of Trump presents a major problem for Republicans who hope to keep their seats or take seats away from Democrats.Indeed, instead of riding Trump s coattails to victory, Republicans are looking at down-ballot rejection as people associate them with the Republican nominee and his vile campaign.Despite being destroyed by Trump, Texas Senator Ted Cruz wants to lend a hand to his colleagues. That can go a long way toward establishing good relationships,  one Cruz adviser told The Hill.  At the same time, though, I d be wildly surprised if he suddenly started moderating his principles just to get along. Establishing good rapport with colleagues is incredibly crucial to running for higher office. But Ted Cruz has alienated and pissed off most of his Senate colleagues because of his aggressive losing strategies in recent years, the biggest of which is undoubtedly the government shutdown in 2013.Cruz incited the shutdown because he thought it would force President Obama to dismantle Obamacare. In the end, it was a PR nightmare for Republicans as the American people rightfully blamed them for shutting the government down.But the Cruz adviser thinks his colleagues will be interested in taking Cruz s help. I think politicians are practical people,  he said.  They re going to be pretty interested in the kind of support he can give them I think fewer people would say they don t want him now. Unfortunately for Cruz, he seriously underestimates just how much his colleagues loathe him.As it stands, incumbent Republicans facing tough re-election battles don t want Ted Cruz making their lives more difficult.When asked by The Hill if she would accept help from Ted Cruz, New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte said,  Uh, no. I don t think I d ask anyone to come up, generally, other than I had [Sens.] Joni [Ernst (Iowa)] and Shelley [Moore Capito (W.Va.)] up,  she continued.  This is about me campaigning for New Hampshire. I m going to be focusing on my campaign for me. It s not a reflection on him, or anyone else he hasn t contacted me, but I m sure there s a lot of different races out there. In other words, please don t come to New Hampshire, Ted.In Pennsylvania, Senator Pat Toomey also faces a tough campaign, but that doesn t mean he wants Cruz there to make it worse.[Cruz is] not going to [be] into what my campaign is doing,  Toomey insisted.And then there is Arizona Senator John McCain, who has famously referred to Cruz as a  whacko bird.  Yeah, he definitely does not want Cruz stumping for him in his home state.McCain said he only seeks help from people he is close to.  I m not close to Sen. Cruz,  McCain declared.So it looks like many Republicans would rather not have Cruz s support, which isn t surprising considering how extreme he is on several issues.Frankly, if Cruz wanted his colleagues to be more enthusiastic, perhaps he should have thought about that before becoming the most annoying voice in the Senate.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"May 31, 2016"

16328,NATIONAL ARCHIVES MISSING Massive Data From Clinton White House Records,"The National Archives inspector general investigated the theft. Later emails released by the State Department do not indicate if the federal government ever found the hard drive.There s also the separate case of Sandy Berger who literally stuck documents in his clothes and left the National Archives with them. He was later found cutting the documents up with scissors! It s understood that he wanted to destroy any papers with writing/notes written in the margins. He was the National Security advisor for the Clinton administration and it appears he was a good and loyal soldier to the Clintons when he destroyed evidence These two case of stolen documents have not been solved and we feel it s yet another case of a Clinton coverup A newly released email from the State Department shows that Hillary Clinton was informed in April 2009 of a massive theft of data pertaining to former President Bill Clinton s White House records.On April 13, 2009, Clinton attorney Cheryl Mills informed newly sworn-in Secretary of State Hillary Clinton via email that the National Archives could not account for a two-terabyte hard drive. The drive may contain a wide range of memos, emails, and other electronic documents from the Clinton White House.  The hard drive contained information from the administration of her husband, former President Bill Clinton.The email was made public from State Department files on Thursday as part of an ongoing release of recovered emails that had been previously deleted from Clinton s private server.The forwarded email said the National Archives had a duplicate and was examining it to know what was stolen. It was stolen or misplaced between Jan. 30, 2009, and March 24, 2009.The possible data losses were all serious but only three documents were classified. Social Security numbers and dates of births may have been lost to thieves. Political information may have been stolen too. Two terabytes is a very very large amount of data; the drive may contain a wide range of memos, emails, and other electronic documents from the Clinton White House,  wrote Blake Roberts, deputy associate White House counsel for President Barack Obama.  All the material is unclassified, except for three documents which Bill Leary has examined and does not believe present any significant risk. But the loss was still serious. Based on its analysis, NARA (National Archives) believes the drive contains other sensitive material, including: There is at least a 50% likelihood that the personal information (including DOB and SSN) of all individuals placed through the Clinton Presidential Personnel Office was on the lost hard drive,  wrote Roberts.  There is a 90% likelihood that the personal information (including DOB and SSN) of all Clinton WH staff was on the lost hard drive. There is a 100% chance that some of it was on the lost hard drive. The three classified documents were authored by Lael Brainard, then a top nominee for the Department of the Treasury, Roberts wrote. There are almost certainly records from many other White House officials,  he said.The National Archives inspector general investigated the theft. Later emails released by the State Department do not indicate if the federal government ever found the hard drive. The federal government said they would notify affected people of the breach.The National Archives later did issue a press release on July 16, 2009, updating the public on the search for the hard drive. It offered a reward of $50,000. It also said 15,750 individuals had to be notified by mail of the possible theft.It s not clear why the hard drive was stolen eight years after Bill Clinton left office, and at the start of a new Democratic administration that included his wife, Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state.Theft of records from the National Archives had happened before.The late Sandy Berger, Bill Clinton s national security adviser from 1997 to 2001, removed several documents from the National Archives between Sept. 2, 2003, and Oct. 2, 2003.Berger removed the classified documents from the National Archives by sneaking them out in his socks and pants. Berger then stored and retained such documents at his place of employment. He pleaded guilty in 2005 but received no prison time, according to CNN.",Government News,"Nov 3, 2016"

2676, Dianne Feinstein: Trump Is ‘Splitting’ The United States Apart,"Senator Dianne Feinstein went on Fox News this Sunday and ripped President Trump a new one.Pointing out the rank hypocrisy over Trump s executive actions and how Republicans treated President Obama, Feinstein called on the president to unite the country. Instead of uniting, Feinstein said, he s splitting it apart even more:You ve got people in the streets here. This president has not brought this nation together. He says he s working for his base. Well, there are a majority of people who are outside of that base. My best advice has been, and I was able to say this to him directly,  Please Mr. President, you have to bring this country together.  What he s doing is splitting it apart.Currently, the majority of the United States has an unfavorable view of Trump, who set a record for quickest descent into net negative approval ratings over 50 percent. In contrast, it took President Obama almost 1,000 days to reach that point. Trump did it in eight.Feinstein also blasted Trump for his immigration ban, telling Chris Wallace that he is  not a dictator  and that the Supreme Court will ultimately decide if his executive action is unconstitutional.Similarly, the majority of Americans are sharply disapproving of his immigration executive order, and his handling of terrorism, national security, and immigrant, all key tenets to his 2016 campaign.The most shocking statistic comes from Public Policy Polling, which found 40 percent of the American public wants to impeach President Trump. That number is up 5 points from a similar question asked just a week ago. In comparison, it took 16 months after Watergate for the American public to reach that number in support of Nixon s resignation. Trump s done it in two weeks.Not surprisingly, 88-92 percent of Republicans support of the job President Trump is doing. Only 7-10 percent of Democrats believe so. And every major poll has shown independent voters to be sharply divided, with all polls tilting negative.Senator Feinstein is right: President Trump is splitting this country apart all to appease the small minority who voted for him. All his promises of being the president who bridges the two Americas has completely fallen flat.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"February 5, 2017"

Germany s Angela Merkel has just promised to dial back on immigration but it s really too late now as you can see in this video from Vlad Tepes: Quantifying the Impact of Border Trash:Apprehensions of individuals by the U.S. Border Patrol as a result of illegal immigration vary every year. Current U.S. Border Patrol statistics indicate that in federal fiscal year 2015, which ended on September 30, approximately 63,400 border crossers were apprehended in the Tucson Sector, which doesn t count the many others who get through. The border crossers leave approximately six to eight pounds of trash in the desert during his or her journey. The cost of disposing of this trash is high for local communities.

These fees do not include costs for materials, equipment, labor and transportation for the collection and transfer of the trash to the landfill.",Government News,"Dec 16, 2015"
7781, White Supremacists Robocall For Trump Ahead Of Super Tuesday (AUDIO),"A Super PAC representing white nationalists is robocalling voters in Vermont and Minnesota, urging them to vote for Donald Trump.According to Minnesota s StarTribune, the American National Super PAC is not being particularly discriminate with the calls.

Minnesota s StarTribune published a transcript of the call, which reads, The American Nationalist Super PAC makes this call to support Donald Trump. I am William Johnson, a farmer and white nationalist. The white race is dying out in America and Europe because we are afraid to be called racist. This is our mind-set: It s OK that our government destroys our children s future, but don t call me racist. I m afraid to be called racist. It s OK to give away our country for immigration, but don t call me racist. It s OK that few schools anymore have beautiful white children in the majority, but don t call me racist. Gradual genocide against the white race is OK, but don t call me racist. I m afraid to be called racist. Donald Trump is not a racist, but Donald Trump is not afraid. Don t vote for a Cuban; vote for Donald Trump.  This call is not authorized by Donald Trump.

Sigh.Posted by David Dwyer on Saturday, January 9, 2016Donald Trump has the white supremacist vote all tied up, much to the dismay of the other Republican candidates.Trump has doubled-down on the party s long history of using dog-whistle politics to appeal to the lowest element of society. Instead of dog-whistles, Trump has brought the Republican party s racist views to the forefront, using a giant bullhorn.The candidate s racist comments about Hispanics, Blacks, Muslims, Asians, along with every other group that white KKKristian society loves to blame for the problems caused by their own party, has rocketed Trump straight to the head of the pack (or Super PAC).It makes sense. After all, conservative voters have been answering the GOP s more-subtle calls, packed with racist innuendo, for a very long time.Right-wing voters are frustrated and angry at mainstream conservatives, whom they see as too concerned with  political correctness,  to come right out and say what they mean.They re sick and tired of their political leaders denying and walking back racist comments. They want Trump s brand of  honesty  and  sincerity.  They want the GOP to openly promote the party s racists views, helping to make their hate seem more  acceptable,  and  mainstream. To hell with the dog-whistles.With Trump they have a leader who will blast their white supremacist views on a bullhorn, and that s exactly what they want.Image credit from Gage Skidmore, via Flickr",News,"February 29, 2016"
5464, Ivanka Trump’s Rabbi Decides Not Speak At RNC For A Very Good Reason,"With the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio just days away, presumptive GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump s list of speakers just got shorter. Many Republicans are opting out of attending the event with the exception of an underwear model, Gov. Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Chris Christie and Ben Carson. And now, Ivanka Trump s Rabbi has decided not to attend.Politico obtained an email from Rabbi Haskel Lookstein to his congregation in which he explained after a backlash that he accepted an invitation from Trump s daughter to deliver the convocation in Cleveland  out of respect for her and our relationship. But that s all changed now and he explained to his congregation why he had a change of heart.Politico reports: Unfortunately, when my name appeared on a list of speakers at the convention, without the context of the invocation I had been invited to present, the whole matter turned from rabbinic to political, something which was never intended,  wrote Lookstein, who also served as the principal of the prominent Orthodox Jewish school Ramaz.But there may be more to it than that   like the backlash that ensued when it was revealed that Lookstein was to speak at the convention.Earlier on Friday, the Jerusalem Post reported that 600 Ramaz alumni had written Lookstein a letter, condemning his decision to speak at the convention.  This is the single action history will remember you by, and history will not be kind,  it read.Lookstein noted in the email the prayer he intended to deliver at the convention, which reads, in part: We thank you for our constitutional government that has created and fostered the American ideals of democracy, freedom, justice and equality for all, regardless of race, religion or national origin. Almighty God: We know that we are living in very dangerous times, when all of these blessings are threatened from without, by forces of terror and unimaginable brutality, and from within, by those who sow the seeds of bigotry, hatred and violence, putting our lives and our way of life at risk. He was seriously going to say that at the divisive GOP candidate s convention. With Ted Cruz, Huckabee and Trump in the room, he was going to speak against bigotry? Wow. That would have gone as well as Ted Nugent speaking at the Democratic Convention. That is, if we even believe the Rabbi s excuse. The letter penned by 600 Ramaz alumni likely had something to do with Lookstein s decision.The Donald is having a very bad day. Tim Tebow released a video in which he strongly denies a story circulated by Trump s presidential campaign that he will be a speaker at the Republican Convention. Many GOP leaders as well as rising stars in the party are opting out of speaking at the event. However, Trump does have his family members penciled in to offer praise for the hotel magnate. And that includes Ivanka   but without her Rabbi.Featured image via John Sommers II/Getty.",News,"July 15, 2016"
681, Australia Prime Minister Tells Trump To Man Up And Accept Refugees Because ‘A Deal’s A Deal’,"The  deal-maker  just got owned.Donald Trump embarrassed himself and America again during a recent phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.As we all know, President Obama struck a deal with Australia in 2015 agreeing to take 2,000 refugees from Nauru and Papua New Guinea s Manus Island.But Trump doesn t want to honor the deal, so he whined about it. I hate taking these people,  Trump said.  I guarantee you they are bad. That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people. The refugees are in a detention camp right now because they have been denied entry into Australia. They are not necessarily  bad  people.Trump s  milk people  remark is a reference to the American dairy industry.It s a racist remark, of course. Because not all immigrants perform farm work. Some become doctors and businessmen. Some become teachers and police officers. Some even go into politics.The fact is that United States can also hold these refugees until a thorough vetting process is complete before allowing them to resettle. Therefore, Trump s concern that these refugees are  bad  is ridiculous.Anyway, Turnbull, who is also a businessman, told Trump to suck it up and honor the terms of the agreement. There is nothing more important in business or politics than a deal is a deal,  Turnbull reminded Trump.  You can certainly say that it was not a deal that you would have done, but you are going to stick with it. In other words, the man who allegedly wrote  The Art of The Deal  just got schooled on deal-making by Australia s prime minister.Turnbull is right. A deal is a deal and Trump must comply with it or risk angering and alienating one of our closest allies.Trump cannot just go back and examine every deal made in American history and go back on it if he doesn t agree with it. That s not how governing works. Sitting presidents must honor the agreements made by their predecessors. Anything else violates trust between nations and hurts our reputation around the globe.He can try to renegotiate a deal if he wishes and some deals can even be voided by Congress. But the deal with Australia will be hard to renegotiate because Turnbull expects America to honor it.And we should. It s the right thing to do.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"August 3, 2017"

5653, NC Governor Robs Disaster Relief Fund To Hire Lawyers To Defend Trans Bathroom Bill,"Can you put a price on bigotry? North Carolina Republicans just did. It s $500,000.North Carolina is a state precariously placed in the danger zones of both hurricanes and tornadoes. It s suffered its fair share of disastrous floods. It s warm enough to be a fertile ground for the mosquitoes experts warn could be spreading the devastating Zika virus. So it s more than just a little crazy that Republican Governor Pat McCrory announced that he would be robbing his state s own disaster relief fund to pay for the defense of his illegal trans bathroom bill.Led by McCrory, state Republicans have diverted half a million dollars from the state s  Emergency Response and Disaster Relief  fund and say they will use it to hire lawyers to fight tooth-and-nail against the federal government which has deemed the anti-trans bill known as HB2 unconstitutional. Considering how obvious it is that this violates the Civil Rights Act, the money will serve only to delay the inevitable for as long as possible.The law has already cost the state tens of millions of dollars in lost business, boycotts, and bad press. Adding the $500,000 is only going to make things worse. This is particularly dire because the fight against the Zika virus continues to go unfunded at the federal level. A recent bill proposed by Republicans to give some of the funds was shot down by Democrats after they insisted on including an amendment to defund Obamacare. The premise, to take away millions of Americans health insurance during the outbreak of a potential health epidemic was, to put it lightly, repugnant on every level.So rather than get serious at a state level, North Carolina decided to defund itself. It will now head into the eye of the Zika storm with a pitiable amount of money to combat it. Instead, they will pay for a few lawyers to ensure trans people are victimized for just a few months longer. If that doesn t say it all, I don t know what does.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"July 1, 2016"

As people sitting around the Thanksgiving table talking about these issues as they should and I m sure they will all across the country, I hope that s a question that will be raised and asked by members around the table,  Earnest said, referring to a bill supported by Democrat to ban people on the no-fly list from purchasing a gun.Earnest attributed opposition to the bill from Republicans and some Democrats to  fear  of the National Rifle Association.But as Breitbart News gun reporter AWR Hawkins has noted, the campaign is misguided as the no-fly list is imprecise.

16815,"TREASON? White House Says It’s “Entirely likely,” “Even expected” Iran Will Use $Billions In Sanctions Relief For Terrorism [VIDEO]","So can anyone please explain what the U.S. got in return for Obama s brilliant  nuclear deal? White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Thursday it was  entirely likely  and  even expected  that Iran will continue to support terrorism as it receives tens of billions of dollars in sanctions relief through the Iran nuclear deal.The deal brokered by the Obama administration and other world powers gives Iran, the world s largest state sponsor of terrorism, $100 billion in sanctions relief in exchange for compliance with the agreement meant to stop the rogue regime from getting nuclear weapons.After Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged Thursday that  some  Iran deal money would go to terrorists, CBS reporter Margaret Brennan asked Earnest at the White House briefing whether he agreed. I think that reflects his rather logical conclusion that a nation that supports terrorism may use some of the money that s coming into the country to further support terrorism,  Earnest said.  The thing that s important for people to recognize is that critics of this agreement often exaggerate the value of the sanctions relief that Iran will obtain, and they often overlook the rather severe economic priorities that are badly underfunded inside of Iran. Earnest said the White House had been honest about acknowledging that the nuclear deal would not assuage their concerns about Iran s  bad behavior. It is entirely likely, I think it s even expected, that Iran will continue to support terrorism, but because of Iran s intention that we assess to continue to support terrorism, that s what makes it so important that we prevent them from obtaining a nuclear weapon,  Earnest said. To be clear, what you re saying is while, some may conclude, and it would be logical to conclude, that some monies may flow to groups labeled terrorists, you think you can mitigate the threat, but you do say it could flow there,  Brennan said.

7049, Bill O’Reilly DESTROYS Donald Trump In A Rant That Shakes Fox News (VIDEO),"In growing signs that rumors of a Fox News split on GOP frontrunner Donald Trump are true, Bill O Reilly is the latest Fox News heavyweight to take a swing at the Trump Campaign. The O Reilly Factor host described the behavior of Donald Trump as  not presidential,  and called on the campaign to  stop the nonsense. O Reilly starts with Trump s response to losing to Ted Cruz in Wisconsin, which for those who missed it, was to issue an aggressive statement denouncing  Lyin Ted : Last night after losing Wisconsin, Trump issued a statement calling Ted Cruz names. Not Presidential. Not a smart move.Seems the Trump campaign is confused.We were hoping the candidate would appear on the Factor this evening, we negotiated with his team for days. But he declined.That of course, is his prerogative. Apparently there is angst in the Trump campaign because Charles Krauthammer sometimes hammers Trump on the Factor. So that s what has driven the Trump Campaign into a frenzy. Like any playground battle amongst toddlers, it is all about who is hanging out with whom. O Reilly is known to have Pulitzer prize-winning columnist Charles Krauthammer on his show fairly frequently, but Krauthammer hates Donald trump, which means the Trump campaign hates Charles Krauthammer and everyone is now throwing sand in each other s faces.And just to reassure you: if this all sounds like the sort of immature behavior that is demeaning to the office for which Donald Trump is running, you re right   it is. But this is the gutter into which the Republican party has dragged itself in recent years, and where it may well die in its own juices.In a week where Greg Gutfeld and Megyn Kelly gave powerful denunciations of Donald Trump and their colleagues who soft pedal interviews and debates with him, O Reilly stepped up with some home truths of his own. The veteran host made it absolutely clear that his team would not be intimidated by the schoolyard bully tactics of the Trump campaign, drawing a clear line in the sand. We have been very fair very fair to Donald Trump on this program, but that does not mean we ll not criticize him or cancel guests who have a dim view of him. O Reilly goes on to demand the Trump campaign  stop the nonsense  and learn to answer fair questions directly, because it will be the only way he gain the support to win. His current level of support  not nearly enough to secure him the White House. Ouch. It seems the Trump campaign is busy alienating every friend it ever made, by demanding an exclusivity of pro-Trump content  or else. Donald Trump was clearly watching the show, as he took to Twitter immediately to refute O Reilly with a one-liner   totally proving O Reilly s point.I was not scheduled to be on the @oreillyfactor.

283," Trump Lashes Out At Puerto Ricans, Calls Them ‘Ingrates’ In Self-Congratulatory Tweets","Again, these are AMERICAN citizens he is talking about.If Donald Trump had treated Texas and Florida the way he is treating Puerto Rico right now, there would be riots in the streets and massive protests in front of the White House.But apparently, people don t seem to understand that the people of Puerto Rico are American citizens who should be given the same respect and treatment that Texans and Floridians received after hurricanes slammed their states.Trump has not done that so far. Not only was he too slow in responding because he focused more on trying to force NFL players to stand during the national anthem, he has not sent nearly enough troops or equipment or supplies to Puerto Rico. And he is insulting them to add insult to injury.Trump has taken to Twitter to constantly brag about the recovery operation despite his response being worse than President George W. Bush s response to Hurricane Katrina. Puerto Rico was devastated by two Category 5 hurricanes, yet less water and food has been sent to the island.When Trump s administration tried to frame the disaster as a  good news story,  San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz fired back by pointing out that people are dying. Trump threw a temper tantrum in response and suggested that Puerto Ricans are lazy people who won t help themselves.On Sunday morning, Trump lashed out again. While bragging about the recovery effort as if it s the best recovery effort in history, Trump congratulated himself and called Puerto Ricans who criticize the weak effort  ingrates.

4973, WATCH: Joy Reid Shuts Down Right-Wing Pastor For Lying In Defense Of Racist Trump,"A pastor shamefully lied in defense of Donald Trump on Saturday and Joy Reid shut him down HARD.During an interview on MSNBC, conservative  Christian  pastor Darrell Scott, who is one of the few black people in America who support the Republican nominee, pretended that Trump is not a racist and denied that Trump had anything to do with the birther movement against President Obama.Trump tried to sell himself to black voters on Friday in front of an audience of white people by telling them they have  nothing to lose  by voting for him. That led Reid to ask,  If Donald Trump makes a speech to black people when there are none around to hear it, did he make a sound? Reid turned to Scott and noted that Trump has made two appeals to black voters in recent days in places where the black population only makes up about 1 percent of the total.  Why is he making those appeals in front of almost exclusively white audiences?  she asked.Scott made excuses for Trump, claiming that it doesn t matter where he speaks because all African-Americans hear him. When pressed on why Trump has not accepted invitations from the NAACP, the Urban League, and the National Association of Black Journalists because he supposedly had better things to do already on his schedule.Reid smiled as Scott called Trump  a cultural phenomenon  who draws rock star crowds. Reid then zinged back that those crowds are devoid of black people.Reid slammed Trump for pushing the false notion that every black person in America is living in poverty and going to failing schools and then asked Scott about Trump s history of housing discrimination, which has been cited by the Justice Department because the Republican nominee refused to rent to black people.Scott claimed that it was just an accusation and denied that Trump discriminated against black people, but the record shows that Trump settled the case with the government because there was a strong case against him, hardly the action of a man who didn t commit such an offense.Reid then asked Scott about Trump s prominent role in the birther movement. Despite multiple video tapes of Trump pushing the birther conspiracy and demanding President Obama s birth certificate, Scott also denied that Trump had anything to do with the movement. Don t tell me you agree with the bitherism, sir,  Reid pleaded.  Don t tell me you agree with that. Scott replied by claiming that Hillary Clinton started the birther movement, a notion that is totally false. And Reid shut Scott down for blatantly lying on her show. That s wrong. Even a pastor cannot make things up on this show,  she cautioned. I respect you as a pastor, but you re not going to come on and make things up. Here s the video via MSNBC.Donald Trump is desperately trying to save his flailing campaign and that s the only reason why he is making feeble attempts to court black voters now. If he really cared about black people he would have been courting them from the beginning. Instead, he has been palling around with white supremacists and encouraging violence against black protesters at his rallies. Scott can t sit there and call himself a man of God while lying through his teeth to defend a bloated racist. It s just not going to fly.Featured image via screenshot",News,"August 20, 2016"

American Military News   U.S. Special Operations Forces have captured a top militant who was  instrumental  in the Benghazi attack in Libya in 2012 that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens, an information management officer, and two former Navy SEALs, according to a report by the Associated Press.The Associated Press reported Monday that Special Operations Forces have captured the unidentified militant and are transporting the militant back to the U.S. The officials say U.S. commandos captured the unidentified man in Libya and are transporting him back to the U.S. The officials say the mission was approved by President Donald Trump and done in coordination with Libya s internationally recognized government,  the AP reported, adding that the officials  weren t authorized to speak  and  demanded anonymity. The U.S. Ambassador to Libya, J. Christopher Stevens; U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith; and CIA contractors Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, both former Navy SEALs, were killed in the attacks against the diplomatic compound five years ago.",politics,"Oct 30, 2017"
2740, Republicans Just Changed The Rules To Force Through Trump’s Controversial Nominees,"Senate Republicans on Wednesday took an extraordinary step to force through two of alleged president Donald Trump s top Cabinet nominees after a boycott from Democrats. Republican lawmakers on the Senate Finance Committee changed the rules so there will no longer be a requirement for Democrats to be present to achieve quorum.Republicans then forced through the controversial picks of Rep. Tom Price for Secretary of Health and Human Services and Steve Mnuchin for Secretary of Treasury.Democrats boycotted for very good reasons:Democrats launched their boycott Tuesday because they felt there were too many unanswered questions about the two nominees  possible ethics violations. They refused to participate in the process if there wouldn t be more time for vetting. When not a single Democrat showed up on Tuesday, the vote could not proceed, because of a rule requiring at least one member from the minority party be present.Every single seat on the Democrats  side of the dais was empty.Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT) called the boycott  extraordinary circumstances  and allowed the Republicans in the room vote to suspend the rules of the committee.  They, on their own accord, refused to participate in the exercise,  he said.  They have nobody to blame but themselves. The day before, Hatch said the Democrats were  acting like idiots  for their boycott. He said that as if he has no memory of the obstruction Republicans openly launched against President Obama for 8 years.And Democrats have ample reasons to scrutinize the nominees. There is evidence that both Price and Mnuchin lied to the committee.That swamp is being filled with terrifying creatures:For example, Mnuchin has even acknowledged that his answers were not  true, accurate, and complete,  as was apparent from his need to revise his initial disclosure questionnaire twice because of entities he  inadvertently missed.  He also testified that OneWest Bank never used  robo-signers,  even though it frequently did.And there were already questions about whether he was qualified to serve in the position in the first place. Mnuchin s bank foreclosed on tens of thousands of people while accepting $1 billion in loan forgiveness from the FDIC, and may have even broken the law by backdating documents to rush foreclosures.Price, too, has issues. He was involved in legislation that could have benefited his stock holdings. His tax returns and financial disclosure statements were brought into question ahead of the hearing.In the end, both of Trump s nominees were approved 14 0.Hatch was confronted by reporters who rushed over to the building because of the little notice given to the public about the meeting to suspend the rules. He reportedly chuckled and said,  You were scrambling? Well, you know, that s neither here nor there. Hatch admitted that he has not yet spoken with the committee s top Democrat, Sen. Ron Wyden.  I don t feel a bit sorry for them,  he said.Questions will be left unanswered:Democrats asked that Price offer clarify on  inaccurate and misleading answer to questions about privileged and discounted access to stocks,  and wanted Mnuchin to address  inaccurate and misleading answer to questions about the potentially illegal process known as robo-signing,  among other things. I don t care what they want at this point,  Hatch said.One thing we could agree with Trump on is that the swamp needs to be drained. Of course, we knew he wouldn t keep that promise. Republicans have launched an attack on democracy.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.",News,"February 1, 2017"
7505, Why A Wall Street Investor Endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders,"Asher Edelman inspired the character Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stone s 1987 film, Wall Street, played by Michael Douglas. The infamous stockbroker, who made a fortune buying and selling companies in distress, was recently asked on CNBC s Fast Money, who he would endorse for Bernie Sanders. His answer was surprising, but his reasoning is not: Bernie Sanders, no question,  said Edelman. ,  I think it s quite simple again. If you look at something called  velocity of money  That means how much gets spent and turns around. When you have the top one percent getting money, they spend five-ten percent of what they earn. When you have the lower end of the economy getting money, they spend a hundred, or a hundred and ten percent of what they earn. As you ve had a transfer of wealth to the top, and a transfer of income to the top, you have a shrinking consumer base, basically, and you have a shrinking velocity of money. Edelman argued redistributing wealth, especially at the point we are at now with levels of income and wealth inequalities continually growing, is what is best for the economy. Greed and corruption may allow the wealthiest to gain short term profits, but as the middle class disappears and the working class becomes ever burdened, the economy begins to sputter into stagnation.Senator Bernie Sanders  economic policies aren t radical, socialist, or unrealistic. They are simply what is needed to be implemented to fix a broken, rigged economy. Edelman may be a member of the top one percent, but he is intelligent enough to realize trickle down economics doesn t work, and the Republicans who insist on perpetuating economic policies surrounding that myth continue to damage the United States economy.The rich getting richer don t create jobs, customers do. If there aren t any customers to purchase goods and services, such as a middle and working class who earn enough to have disposable income, the economy will falter.Featured image via Addicting Info archives",News,"March 14, 2016"
12971,HILLARY EPICALLY BOMBS PRESS CONFERENCE About Weekends Attacks By Saying All The Wrong Things [VIDEO],"Hillary Clinton is known world-wide for saying and doing the most ridiculous things, but her press conference concerning the attacks over the weekend has to be the most ridiculous to date.Any American that truly decides to actually listen to the things she said can see that she has run out of any form of ammo against Trump that she thought she had.Just a few of the things she said that will make you think twice: We need a better Visa System. Lets remember what happened on 9/11. These were not refugees. We need to do everything we can to support law enforcement. We will defeat the evil, twisted ideology of the terrorists.   Take the fight to ISIS everywhere they threaten us. These are just a few in a 12 minute long dialogue that sounds like she is doing her best to literally say the opposite of everything she has ever said before.  Hillary even has the gall to claim that Trump is aiding and abetting terrorists. She must have forgotten that she is the one who takes monetary gifts from places like Iran.In an ironic twist Hillary basically blames Trump for any and all attacks saying that his anti-Muslim rhetoric is the root cause for Muslims to want to attack us. Really Hillary?Clinton has tried to push the refugee program on us even after it was made clear that the  refugees  cannot be vetted properly. She has fully supported Black Lives Matter and continuously disrespects Law Enforcement. Hillary has said more than once that she supports the rights of Muslims in America (Sharia Law). Furthermore she tries to label anyone that protests the radical ideology of Islam as terrorists. Every word she says in the press conference is a direct contradiction of her record:",politics,"Sep 19, 2016"
6510, Moms With Transgender Kids Have A BRILLIANT Message For Anti-LGBT Conservatives (VIDEO),"Moms of transgender children have just sent every fearmongering transphobic conservative a message that is going to make them furious. In response to the massive amount of hatred and bigotry that has been thrown at the trans community over the last few months, these amazing mothers have given anti-LGBT bigots a brilliant   and sometimes heartbreaking   look at the people who are on the receiving end of the attacks.The video, entitled  Meet My Child , was created by the Trans United Fund for the many transgender adults and children who have been discriminated against and attacked by politicians in 20 states via initiatives like  bathroom bills  in North Carolina. These lawmakers have made it their personal mission to strip trans people of their basic human rights and have Attempted to advance over 50 pieces of legislation attacking transgender people. These policies are a real danger to transgender people and hurt the most vulnerable, including America s transgender children. Meet My Child features three mothers sharing amazing stories of acceptance and love, as well as the process their families when through when their child expressed that they were transgender. The moms in this video want every anti-trans person to know the full extent and consequences of the bigotry they re promoting, which often ends in violent attacks on transgender people. In one particularly emotional moment, a mother with a trans daughter can hardly hold back tears as she says, She s my heart and I don t want to lose her.  The film also leapt at the opportunity to blast conservatives like former Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz for spewing bigotry that puts these children in harm s way.You can watch the amazing message below: What these mothers have shown is exactly what brilliant parenting looks like. Conservatives claim to be so concerned about babies and family values, but only when families and children fit into their narrow-minded view of what a family unit  should  look like. These moms have done an incredible job showing the world what real love and support looks like, and the GOP could certainly learn a thing or two from them.Featured image via screenshot",News,"May 6, 2016"

8972, Bill Clinton Reminds People Of Hillary’s LONG History Of Getting Things Done (VIDEO),"If there s one couple that Republicans love to attack, it s the Clintons. For decades, they have been under constant dubious scrutiny, more so than almost any other politician. Why? Because they have an incredible history of getting stuff done. Stuff their critics would rather not see be getting passed, and work they would rather not see being accomplished. If Republicans can successfully make a scandal of the Clintons to try to discredit all their accomplishments, that will help Republicans beat Hillary in 2016. It s political theater at its best and worst.Appearing on the campaign trail for this first time this election cycle in Nashua, New Hampshire, was former President Bill Clinton. If anyone can explain the exemplary work Hillary has done throughout her long career, it s Bill. And while many like to say Hillary changes her support with the wind of any popular idea, or copies other candidates, they clearly don t know the work she s done, and how she often set the precedent for not only knowing how to get the job done, but getting it done. This pattern of accomplishment began long before she even remotely thought about running for any sort of elected office.The former president explained that his wife was a minority as a woman among law students at Yale, and while she really could have done anything with her career, she decided to help children and the poor through her work with the Children s Defense Fund. He said: There she was at Yale Law School. She could have written her ticket to go anywhere she wanted all she was really interested in was providing legal services to poor people  She hadn t been elected to anything, but everything she touched became better. As TIME so perfectly summed up Clinton s remarks: He remembered that Hillary had helped found an early education program for immigrant children in Arkansas and that she has investigated the placement of African-American children in adult prisons in South Carolina.In another anecdote, Bill said that Hillary as First Lady worked on a bill to reform foster care policy in the late 1990s with Tom DeLay, then a leading Republican in the House of Representatives. This is all in addition to her later political work, like in helping get the Iran Deal passed, or her part in capturing and killing Osama bin Laden, or her countless hours mending relationships around the globe, all while keeping her cool under the most brutal fallacious condemnation.Clinton stated: I do not believe in my lifetime, anybody has run for this job at a moment of greater importance who was better qualified by knowledge, experience and temperament to do what needs to be done now. Her experience speaks volumes. Her calm under pressure is unmatched, and her ability to get people to come together to get the tough jobs done can be seen in the work she s accomplished.It s clear Bill is in this to win it for Hillary, and is focusing on what his wife has done instead of attacking opposition.It will be interesting to see what the rest of this fast approaching primary season will offer.

4519, Seahawks’ Richard Sherman DROPS THE MIC On Those Who Ignore Police Brutality (VIDEO),"There s a lot being said about football players across the NFL standing together in unity against police brutality. This is even more pertinent now, as even more black men have been gunned down in the street just this week by police.Using his press conference to bring further awareness to this topic was none other than Seattle Seahawks  star cornerback Richard Sherman. He said: I m not going to answer any questions today, and it s no offense to you guys, but the state of things in the world today is very interesting. I think you have players that are trying to take a stand and be aware of social issues and try to make a stand and increase people s awareness and put a spotlight on it and they re being ignored. Whether they re taking a knee or whether they re locking arms, you know, they re trying to bring people together and united them for a cause. And I think that the last couple days a couple more guys have gotten shot and killed in the middle of the street and more videos have come out of guys getting killed, and I think people are still missing the point.The reason these guys are kneeling. The reason we re locking arms is to bring people together. To make people aware that this is not right. You know, it s not right for people to get killed in the street. Sherman then explains how he s been proactive in the community and even needing to go so far as to train young people of color on how to behave with the police, but still being fearful that they might get shot. He says,  that s an unfortunate time to be living.  Especially when people are being killed for no reason.He then has some choice words by those who are supposedly offended by those standing up against police brutality by quietly using their First Amendment right of dissent and protest to bring awareness to the plight. Sherman says: When a guy takes a knee, you can ignore it. You can say he s not being patriotic. He s not honoring the flag. I m doing none of those things. I m saying straight up, this is wrong and we need to do something. And something most certainly needs to be done, and done now.Watch Sherman speak here:Wow  this is a must-watch.Seattle Seahawks  Richard Sherman addresses police killings of African American men at presser, then walks out. pic.twitter.com/GOAOSgufAx  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) September 22, 2016Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 22, 2016"
8849, New Group Of Armed Idiots Show Up To Provide ‘Security’ For Bundy Militia Terrorists (VIDEO),"Just when we thought the situation with the Bundy militia in Oregon couldn t get any worse, it does. The drama is heating up now, because another group of lawless armed militants have decided to come be the  security  for the militia. There s just one problem with that, though: the original militia says they don t want these new folks there.The new group calls themselves the Pacific Patriot Network, and they have taken it upon themselves to send armed guards from their group to  protect  the original occupying militia. However, Todd MacFarlane, who is a lawyer for the Bundy side of the standoff, says of these new people: We don t need that. We don t want it and we re asking you to leave. According to the Bundy group, they really want to keep the situation from getting any worse than it already has. MacFarlane says that the Bundy group is, quote,  alarmed  by the Pacific Patriot Network guards. According the Brandon Curtiss, who heads the Pacific Patriot Network up, the guards he sent will only be  patrolling the perimeter  and has no plans to interfere with original occupants, or even join them in occupation.However, the point is, the Bundys people don t want them there. The new people must be really scary if the original terrorists don t even want anything to do with them. At this point, the federal government needs to simply step in and do something about these people. It really has gotten way out of hand.Watch Bundy s militia people talk about these newbies, below:Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 10, 2016"

8465, Karma’s A B*tch: Judge Orders Anti-Gay Preacher’s Church Up For Public Auction Due To Unpaid Debts,"Pastor James David Manning is one of the most vocally homophobic preachers in America. He is the leader of Atlah Worldwide Church, and has made such disgusting public statements as  Jesus would stone homos,  and tried to accuse gay people of spreading Ebola through Starbucks coffee. Well, Pastor Manning is finally getting his comeuppance, because a judge has ordered that his hateful church be put up for public auction.The reason for the order is that Manning has not been paying his church s bill. DNA Info reports that Manning has nine tax liens against the church s property. The debts include, but are not limited to:Manning, however, is as delusional as ever, and insists that he didn t know about the auctioning of his church until last week. This seems to be a flat-out lie, though, as his lawyers responded to the case as early as October 2009, which is a month after the case was opened. Manning also plans to go against the auction order, which was filed by Judge Joan Kenny on December 17, 2015. Manning says of the auctioning of his church: I assure you, it s about a water bill and a tax that can t be levied against this church. I think it s a land grab quite frankly. Though the church is, like all others, tax exempt, Manning seems to be unable to comprehend that being a tax exempt religious institution does not mean that he does not have to pay his bills. To that end, whatever appeals he might make to stop the auction will likely prove fruitless. The auction will be held on February 24.This is all to the good, as the community can now be effectively free of Manning and his followers  constant and unending stream of homophobic hate speech. Harlem will definitely be a better place.Featured image via screen capture from the Manning Report on YouTube",News,"January 29, 2016"

She bravely took the microphone and tearfully explained why she was begging the militia to leave. One would think that most people would feel sympathy for her, but no, some people are too callous to feel anything at all. One such person is right-wing broadcast personality Pete Santilli.Presley is the granddaughter of Judge Steven Grasty, and Santilli decided to capitalize on that fact. He said that Grasty had allowed his grandchild to become a  prostitute.  In one of his broadcasts, live from the wildlife refuge where the militants are camped out, Santilli said: That judge was prostituting his granddaughter for political purposes, I m going to call it for what it is. If it were my granddaughter, I would not treat her like a prostitute like he did. He then went on to attack anyone and everyone who opposes what this militia is doing, calling them   bunch of effing communists  for letting the child speak at the meeting. Santilli ranted: What he did with his granddaughter is disgusting. It s called prostitution, okay? Except you gave it up for free  She s a young girl, she did just a masterful dramatic performance. The only reason that anyone needs to be fearful about what s going on around here are the corrupt bastards like her grandfather. He needs to be fearful because we re going to investigate and we re going to bring some justice to a judge. So, it sounds like this guy is not only attacking a vulnerable, scared teenage girl, but he is also threatening a judge.

428, Trump Brags About Hurricane Size As Florida Braces For Disaster,"Donald Trump is apparently thrilled that Hurricane Irma will be the biggest storm to ever hit the United States.Only weeks after Hurricane Harvey left a swath of devastation and death in Texas, Florida is bracing for an even deadlier and more destructive storm.People will die. Businesses and homes will be wiped off the map. Suffering and homelessness will be the reality in Florida. But Trump is too busy bragging about the size of the hurricane to actually care about the people who are in the path of the storm.In yet another Twitter rant on Wednesday morning, Trump proclaimed that his team is already in Florida preparing for the storm after bragging about what a  good job  they have done in Texas.Watching Hurricane closely. My team, which has done, and is doing, such a good job in Texas, is already in Florida. No rest for the weary!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2017In fact, Trump s response to Hurricane Harvey was to brag about the size of that storm, and he ended an Obama-era flood policy as Houston drowned. Trump has also proposed massive cuts to FEMA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which predicts and tracks hurricanes.It should also be noted that Trump inherited a FEMA that took the lessons of Hurricane Katrina seriously in preparation for future storms. So, Trump and his team did nothing special.But what Trump did next on Twitter shows just how little empathy and compassion he has for the people in the path of Hurricane Irma.Hurricane looks like largest ever recorded in the Atlantic!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2017Yeah, you read that right. Trump literally bragged about the size of this hurricane as if it s something to be proud of. This coming from a man who denies the very climate change that is causing bigger and more destructive hurricanes to form.As Floridians prepare for disaster, they must be wondering why Trump is so excited about watching them get slammed by the largest hurricane to ever strike the United States.

6835, Superdelegate Tammy Baldwin: ‘I’m Still A Human’ (VIDEO),"The race is heating up as New York heads into their primary this coming Tuesday. Currently, polls have Hillary Clinton ahead by ten to seventeen points. Clinton, who is ahead nationally by more than 200 pledged delegates and hundreds more superdelegates, will need to win her home state to continue momentum after Sanders  string of wins in the previous weeks.A New York win for Clinton will mean more delegates she desperately needs, and with that will come superdelegate support.But the superdelegates have continued to cause controversy within the Democratic primary. Supporters who back Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders have decried the system, feeling the individuals who make up the superdelegate system have been manifestly unfair as to how they allocate their support.Supporters within the Sanders camp have demanded that the superdelegates vote the same way as the pledged   at the will of the voters for that state.But that isn t how the superdelegate system is set up (another word for superdelegates is unpledged delegates).However, that hasn t stopped the demands. And it hasn t stopped the harsh criticism, either. While these delegates have been regarded as  shills,   bought-and-paid-for  and  establishment, one superdelegate wants to remind the nay-sayers of one thing: they are still human.Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Congress  first openly-lesbian senator, is also a superdelegate. And she s pretty fed up with the inquisitions. On MSNBC s Morning Joe, the progressive senator claimed if Sanders clinches the popular vote by the time the convention is held in July, she will cast her vote for him. However, as Clinton continues her popular vote lead, she s supporting the former Secretary of State. She added, nervously: I am a human being and a Superdelegate. To put it plainly, based on how the rules are set up, Baldwin is free to vote her conscience, and her conscience says Hillary Clinton for now. Those who back Senator Sanders point to the fact he beat Clinton by 13 points in Wisconsin, thus Baldwin is somehow obligated to back him.It is important to remember that these superdelegates are party leaders who, in their own right, have been elected within the Democratic Party   whether it be a position within the DNC, or a senatorial, gubernatorial or representative position. It s also important to remember these delegates have nothing but the best of intentions for their party and the future of the country.Baldwin hasn t reported any harassment, but other superdelegates have (one s 12 year old child received the brunt of hrrasment when they answered the phone).Here s Baldwin s appearance on MSNBC:  Featured image via Astrid Riecken/Getty Images",News,"April 18, 2016"
15593,NO “Dead broke” LESBIANS ALLOWED…,"Hillary heads to DC for an exclusive fundraiser hosted by  one-percenter lesbians Hillary Clinton will be in Washington, D.C., on Monday night for a fundraiser hosted by and attended by predominantly lesbian supporters.About 120 people are expected to attend the event, which is being billed as  an intimate fundraiser  at the Woman s National Democratic Club. The cost to attend is $2,700 per person. For the more generous, those willing to bundle $27,000 ahead of the event also get to attend a special reception with Clinton.The event is being hosted by Claire Lucas and her partner, Judy Dlugacz, who founded a travel company called Olivia, which sells cruises targeting the lesbian community. Lucas told The Huffington Post that she and Dlugacz decided a couple of weeks ago that they wanted to do something to support Clinton s presidential run, so they started reaching out to their network of contacts to gauge interest. The result is Monday s event, which Lucas estimates will be about 75 percent lesbian attendees from around the country. That s atypical for an LGBT political fundraiser, which are by and large organized and attended by gay men. We had such a big group of people wanting to attend,  said Lucas, who acknowledged it is  unusual  that the event will have such a strong lesbian presence.The Clinton event lands just as President Barack Obama has declared June as LGBT Pride Month, something he has done for several years. There are two other Pride-related fundraising events for Clinton s campaign in D.C. this week, though she is not expected to attend them.The first, on June 10, is being hosted by gay Democratic activist Lane Hudson at the Howard Theater. The second one, on June 11, is being hosted by LGBT supporters at Lost Society. That event will include appearances by Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), the first openly lesbian U.S. senator, and four other openly gay members of Congress: Reps. Jared Polis (D-Colo.), David Cicilline (D-R.I.), Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Mark Takano (D-Calif.).Clinton is a vocal supporter of LGBT rights and featured a gay couple in the campaign kick-off video she used in April to announce her presidential run.

4560, Seth MacFarlane Just Told Johnson And Stein Supporters EXACTLY What They Need To Hear (TWEET),"In a perfect democracy, there would be multiple viable parties to choose candidates from. Each one would have to work hard and strive for our vote, and each one would have an equal chance at winning. Unfortunately, because of the way election laws and funding are currently in the United States, we re pretty much stuck with a two-party system and any third-party vote goes to help one of the two major parties.Think Ralph Nader in 2000 and how his votes in Florida gave us George W. Bush. Well, Nader and the Supreme Court.It s imperfect, but until laws are changed, it is what it is. No amount of whining or sitting elections out is going to change that. What we need are legislators willing to change the laws, but that s never going to happen if people keep having hissy fits.This year s election is so critical not just for the nation, but the entire world. A Donald Trump presidency would be catastrophic on so many levels, both with domestic and foreign policy.Reminding everyone how important this election is, and how a third-party vote will give us a President Trump, is none other than the legendary writer/producer and creator of Family Guy, Seth MacFarlane.MacFarlane tweeted: Remember: This November you can help elect President Donald Trump just by voting for Gary Johnson or Jill Stein!

However, it needs to be brought to people s attention that their vote for a third party isn t actually going to put their candidate into office, but rather have the possibility of ushering in the apocalypse with Trump.A  conscience vote  does not do anyone any good with a Fascist in the White House, and it goes much deeper than just feeling good about yourself on election day.So, do what you do. That s your freedom to do so, but remember the unintended consequences of that vote and what will be in store for the entire world.Featured Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images",News,"September 19, 2016"
10063,WATCH OUT RINOS AND DEMOCRATS! The 7 Senate Seats Most Likely to Flip,"We can t wait for next year s midterm elections! This will be a huge chance for Republicans to build a bigger majority in the Senate.The Senate map heavily favors Republicans who look solid except for a couple seats. Democrats don t have it so good. They ll have to defend 25 seats!Here are the seven most vulnerable Senate seats according to The Hill:Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.) Heller is the only Republican up for reelection in 2018 who represents a state that Hillary Clinton won last November. Making matters worse for Heller, he s had a rough 2017.Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) McCaskill is one of the few statewide Democratic officeholders left in Missouri, which Trump won by 19 points in November.Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) Donnelly leveraged a bipartisan approach to politics and his blue-collar appeal into a Senate seat in 2012, but he ll have to fight yet another tough battle if he wants to keep his Senate seat in a state Trump won by 19 points.Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) Flake wouldn t rank this high in a normal election year, but a Republican president threatening to support a primary challenge to an incumbent GOP senator isn t normal, either.Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) In 2016, West Virginia went for Trump by a larger margin than any other state   42 points.Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) Heitkamp hails from another deep-red state   North Dakota went for Trump by about 36 points.Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) Republicans have a lot to like about their Montana prospects. Trump won the state by more than 20 points in November, and Republican Greg Gianforte just won the state s at-large congressional seat in a special election   even after he assaulted a reporter.",politics,"Aug 23, 2017"

911," Desperate Staff Sent Melania To Stop 2-Hour Trump/Putin Meeting, She Failed","If you ever needed evidence of Donald Trump s bromance with Vladimir Putin, it s in the amount of time they spent together. Though their private meeting at the G-20 summit was supposed to last a half hour, Trump ended up spending two hours and sixteen minutes with the man who helped him get elected through a fierce and well-funded propaganda campaign as well as an extensive hacking effort. Several times I had to remind the president, people were sticking their heads in the door,  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the Washington Examiner.  They even sent in the first lady at one point to see if she could get us out of there, and that didn t work either. We went another hour after she came in to see us, so clearly, she failed. There was so much to talk about,  said Tillerson.  Neither one of them wanted to stop. Tillerson says that Trump and Putin got along like they had been best friends all their lives. The two leaders connected very quickly,  he says.  There was a very clear positive chemistry. Don t worry, though. Trump is on top of this Russia scandal thing. He asked Vlad if Russia interfered with our election and accepted at face value that Putin absolutely did not help him win.  Nothing to see here:Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who attended the meeting along with Tillerson, said Trump accepted Putin s assurances that Russia didn t meddle in the U.S. election. But Tillerson said the Russians had asked for  proof and evidence  of its involvement. A day earlier, Trump had said Russia probably meddled but that other countries likely did, too.Tillerson said the two leaders had agreed to continue the discussion, with an eye toward securing a commitment that Russia won t interfere in U.S. affairs in the future.See? Case closed. Nothing to worry about. Everything is perfectly normal.Featured image via Twitter",News,"July 7, 2017"
15555,[VIDEO] SHOCKING CONSEQUENCES OF OPEN IMMIGRATION: Christians Organize To Fight Back Against Islamization Of Britain,"This video shows what happens when a large population of muslim immigrants refuse to assimilate with the culture of residents living in the country where they have immigrated. Instead, muslims in Britain and in countries all over the world are demanding the citizens who have been living there for centuries conform to their extreme radical religious views. In May, new census data published by the British government showed that Islam is set to become the dominant religion in Britain within the next generation.On being informed that the girl did not want to get married, Mohammed Shahid Akhtar, Imam of Birmingham s Central Jamia Masjid Ghamkol Sharif Mosque, said,  She s 14. By Sharia, grace of Allah, she s legal to get married. The Muslim population of Britain topped 3.3 million by the end of 2013 to become around 5.2% of the overall population of 63 million, according to figures extrapolated from a recent study on the growth of the Muslim population in Europe.At the same time, opinion surveys consistently show that voters in Britain view Islam and the question of Muslim immigration as a top-ranked public concern. The British public, it seems, is increasingly worried about the establishment of a parallel Muslim society there.But government efforts to push back against the Islamization of Britain have been halting and half-hearted.What follows is a chronological review of some of the main stories involving the rise of Islam in Britain during 2013.In January, Muslim gangs were filmed loitering on streets in London and demanding that passersby conform to Islamic Sharia law. In a series of videos, the self-proclaimed vigilantes who call themselves Muslim London Patrol are seen abusing non-Muslim pedestrians and repeatedly shouting  this is a Muslim area. One video records the men shouting:  Allah is the greatest! Islam is here, whether you like it or not. We are here! We are here! What we need is Islam! What we need is Sharia! The video continues:  We are the Muslim Patrol. We are in north London, we are in south London, in east London and west London. We command good and forbid evil. Islam is here in London. [Prime Minister] David Cameron, Mr. Police Officer, whether you like it or not, we will command good and forbid evil. You will never get us. You can go to hell! This is not a Christian country. To hell with Christianity. Isa [Jesus] was a messenger of Allah. Muslim Patrol will never die. Allah is great! Allah is great! We are coming! In a January 23 interview with the online newspaper International Business Times, Anjem Choudary, a radical preacher who has long called for Sharia law to be implemented in Britain and other European countries, defended the gang, saying:  This is a wake-up call for society to ask,  where are we headed?  There is a clash between Islam and liberal democracy in hotspot areas of London. Choudary has previously led a campaign, known as the Islamic Emirates Project, to turn twelve British cities including what he calls  Londonistan into independent Islamic states. The so-called Islamic Emirates would function as autonomous enclaves, ruled by Sharia law and governed entirely outside British jurisprudence.In February, Choudary was filmed urging his followers to quit their jobs and claim unemployment benefits so they have more time to plan holy war against non-Muslims.Excerpts of the speech, published by the London-based newspaper The Sun on February 17, drew renewed attention to the growing problem of Muslims in Britain and elsewhere who are exploiting European welfare systems.In the video, Choudary is recorded as saying that Muslims are justified in taking money from non-Muslims, whom he mocks for working in nine-to-five jobs their whole lives. He says:  You find people are busy working the whole of their life. They wake up at 7 o clock. They go to work at 9 o clock. They work for eight, nine hours a day. They come home at 7 o clock, watch EastEnders [a British soap opera], sleep, and they do that for 40 years of their life. That is called slavery. . . . What kind of life is that? That is the life of the kuffar [a non-Muslim]. Choudary urges fellow Muslims to learn from revered figures in Islamic history who only worked one or two days a year.  The rest of the year they were busy with jihad [holy war] and things like that,  he says.  People will say,  Ah, but you are not working.  But the normal situation is for you to take money from the kuffar. So we take Jihad Seeker s Allowance. In March, the London-based newspaper The Independent reported that at least 100 British Muslims are currently active as jihadists fighting in Syria, which has replaced Afghanistan, Pakistan and Somalia as the main destination for militant Islamists seeking to obtain immediate combat experience with little or no official scrutiny.Also in March, St. John s Episcopal Church in Aberdeen, Scotland, became the first church in the United Kingdom to share its premises with Muslim worshippers. Church officials now welcome hundreds of Muslims praying five times a day in their building because the nearby mosque is filled to overcapacity and Muslim worshippers are forced to pray outside.

13197,STEPHEN MOORE: What Republican Turncoats Forget…Examining The Case Of The Republicans For Hillary,"Stephen Moore has been a regular contributor to FOX News and is now a Trump campaign economic adviser. He recently debated the most liberal hack economist on the planet and kicked his a$$:WATCH LYING LIBERAL ECONOMIST Get Hammered By TRUMP S Economic Advisor [Video]He questions the  Republican turncoats  on what they re doing to the conservative movement by not supporting Trump:I asked a successful businessman the other day what he thought about Donald Trump. He turned his thumb down. Wow. Are you going to vote for Hillary? I asked with trepidation.  Of course not,  he replied almost insulted by the question.  I understand the concept of a binary decision.  I got a similar response when I asked oil magnate T. Boone Pickens whether he would vote for Mr. Trump. He looked at me with a quizzical look on his face and replied:  Well, who else is there to vote for?  Right. Who else is there? Yet amazingly a caucus of lifelong Republican politicos in Washington are announcing to the world with defiance and self-righteousness that they will vote for Hillary Clinton. They are mostly former Romney and Bush operatives. They lost and now they want people to believe that their anti-Trumpism is an act of heroism and principle. They ingratiate themselves to The New York Times, The Washington Post and Team Clinton   the sworn enemies of free markets and conservative values. Somehow this doesn t offend their moral compass. I certainly don t mean to disparage conservatives who say they won t vote for Mr. Trump. One s vote is a matter of personal conscience. But to actively support Hillary is to put the other team s jersey on and then run a lap around the stadium. It s worth, because none of the arguments make much sense. First, many say that Trump can t win   it s hopeless. These are the same political geniuses who a year ago assured us that Mr. Trump could never win a primary (he won most of them), then that he couldn t win 50 percent of the vote (he did), then that he couldn t win 50 percent outside of New York (he did), then they said he couldn t win a majority of the delegates (he did)   On every occasion the Trump haters were wrong. How about a little humility since they are batting 0.00. The  Trump can t win  mantra isn t just wrong, it s subversive. Of course, he can win. He is running against Hillary Clinton for goodness sakes. So why do they say this? Because the never Trumpers want Trump to lose because he is to the political class (Republicans and Democrats) the disruptor that Uber is to taxicab drivers. Second is the complaint by some economists that Mr. Trump can t be supported because he is not for free trade. Longtime Washington insider Vin Weber reportedly recently said:  The world economic order and the Republican Party  would be  all in shambles  if Mr. Trump wins.  I think markets would collapse.  Really? Hillary Clinton flip flops every day on free trade, so why is it that only Mr. Trump would cause a recession? He doesn t get that the Trump movement is a revolt against the world order. Mr. Trump is calling for the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. He is for regulatory relief and school choice. Mr. Trump wants to kill Obamacare. Mr. Trump wants a pro-America drilling policy on energy. Hillary wants to soak the rich, increase the debt, stop energy development, expand entitlements and double down on Obamacare. How is this a difficult choice for a free marketeer? Third, the Trump haters say we must throw Mr. Trump over the bus in order to save the Senate and House majorities. This is a foolhardy strategy because one can t win without the other. As economist Donald Luskin puts it in his historical analysis of presidential races and Senate gains:  It is clear from history that the House and the Senate always move in the same party direction as the White House, and with the same magnitude. That means the presidential candidate is like a boat that congressional candidates are riding on. It s really stupid to torpedo that boat.   Finally, there is the view expressed by Bret Stephens, my former colleague at The Wall Street Journal, who wants to  make sure Trump is the biggest loser in presidential history  so that we can  rebuild the conservative movement.  Bret, if Obama/Hillary win a third straight presidential race, there won t be a conservative movement left to rebuild. The Republicans will move to the left. Worse, for President Obama to win effectively a third term will be a voter validation of all of the destructive policies of the last eight years. Do the  never Trumpers  want to facilitate that? Do they want to hand the left its greatest victory for liberal governance of all time? If they do, they, not Trump, are the unforgivable betrayers of conservative principles.

23266,Tyranny Of 9/11: The Building Blocks Of The American Police State From A-Z," No one man can terrorize a whole nation unless we are all his accomplices.    Edward R. MurrowJohn W. Whitehead Huffington PostWe ve walked a strange and harrowing road since September 11, 2001, littered with the debris of our once-vaunted liberties.Over the past 15 years, we have gone from a nation that took great pride in being a model of a representative democracy to being a model of how to persuade the citizenry to march in lockstep with a police state.What began with the passage of the USA Patriot Act in October 2001 has snowballed into the eradication of every vital safeguard against government overreach, corruption and abuse.This is not freedom. This is a jail cell. Set against a backdrop of government surveillance, militarized police, SWAT team raids, asset forfeiture, eminent domain, overcriminalization, armed surveillance drones, whole body scanners, stop and frisk searches, roving VIPR raids and the like all of which have been sanctioned by Congress, the White House and the courts our constitutional freedoms have been steadily chipped away at, undermined, eroded, whittled down, and generally discarded.Our losses are mounting with every passing day.Free speech, the right to protest, the right to challenge government wrongdoing, due process, a presumption of innocence, the right to self-defense, accountability and transparency in government, privacy, press, sovereignty, assembly, bodily integrity, representative government: all of these and more have become casualties in the government s war on the American people, a war that has grown more pronounced since 9/11.Since the towers fell on 9/11, the American people have been treated like enemy combatants, to be spied on, tracked, scanned, frisked, searched, subjected to all manner of intrusions, intimidated, invaded, raided, manhandled, censored, silenced, shot at, locked up, and denied due process.In allowing ourselves to be distracted by terror drills, foreign wars, color-coded warnings, underwear bombers and other carefully constructed exercises in propaganda, sleight of hand, and obfuscation, we failed to recognize that the true enemy to freedom was lurking among us all the while.Indeed, the U.S. government now poses a greater threat to our freedoms than any terrorist, extremist or foreign entity ever could. Here s an A-to-Z primer to spell out exactly what government tyranny means post 9/11.A is for the AMERICAN POLICE STATE.B is for our battered BILL OF RIGHTS.C is for CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE, a diabolical governmental scheme to deprive Americans of their liberties, namely, the right to property.D is for DRONES, weaponized, equipped with lasers, tasers and scanning devices, and aimed at  we the people. E is for ELECTRONIC CONCENTRATION CAMP in which all citizens are suspects, their activities monitored and regulated, their movements tracked, their communications spied upon, and their lives, liberties and pursuit of happiness dependent on the government s say-so.F is for FUSION CENTERS, which serve as a clearinghouse for information shared between state, local and federal agencies. These fusion centers can constantly monitor our communications, everything from our internet activity and web searches to text messages, phone calls and emails.G is for GRENADE LAUNCHERS and GLOBAL POLICE. Take small-town police forces, equip them with enough firepower to render any citizen resistance futile, and then enlist them to be part of the United Nations  Strong Cities Network program, and you not only have a standing army that can operate beyond the reach of the Constitution, but one that is part of a global police force.H is for HOLLOW-POINT BULLETS. The government s efforts to militarize and weaponize its agencies and employees is reaching epic proportions, with federal agencies as varied as the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration stockpiling millions of lethal hollow-point bullets.I is for the INTERNET OF THINGS. This  connected  industry propels us closer to a future where police agencies apprehend virtually anyone if the government  thinks  they may commit a crime, driverless cars populate the highways, and a person s biometrics are constantly scanned and used to track their movements, target them for advertising, and keep them under perpetual surveillance.J is for JAILING FOR PROFIT. Having outsourced their inmate population to private prisons run by private corporations, this profit-driven form of mass punishment has given rise to a $70 billion private prison industry that relies on the complicity of state governments to keep their privately run prisons full by jailing large numbers of Americans for inane crimes.K is for KENTUCKY V. KING, a ruling that opens the door to warrantless police raids, leaving Americans with little real protection in the face of all manner of abuses by law enforcement officials.L is for LICENSE PLATE READERS, which enable law enforcement to track the whereabouts of vehicles, and their occupants, all across the country.M is for MAIN CORE, the U.S. government s database of 8 million or more names and information on Americans considered  threats  to the nation who should be rounded up in times of national emergency or under martial law.N is for NO-KNOCK RAIDS. More than 80,000 of these paramilitary raids are carried out every year more than 200 SWAT team raids every day and all in the pursuit of someone merely suspected of a crime, usually possession of some small amount of drugs.O is for OVERCRIMINALIZATION, which has resulted in an uptick in Americans being arrested and jailed for such absurd  violations  as letting their kids play at a park unsupervised, collecting rainwater and snow runoff on their own property, growing vegetables in their yard, and holding Bible studies in their living room.P is for PATHOCRACY and PRECRIME, tyranny at the hands of a psychopathic government. Couple that with the government s burgeoning precrime programs, and anyone seen as opposing the government whether they re Left, Right or somewhere in between becomes a potential extremist.Q is for QUALIFIED IMMUNITY, which allows officers to walk away without paying a dime for their wrongdoing.R is for ROADSIDE STRIP SEARCHES and BLOOD DRAWS. The courts have increasingly erred on the side of giving government officials especially the police vast discretion in carrying out strip searches, blood draws and even anal probes for a broad range of violations, no matter how minor the offense.S is for the SURVEILLANCE STATE. On any given day, the average American going about his daily business will be monitored, surveilled, spied on and tracked in more than 20 different ways, by both government and corporate eyes and ears.T is for TASERS and other nonlethal weapons, which enable police to aggress with the push of a button, making the potential for overblown confrontations over minor incidents that much more likely.U is for UNARMED CITIZENS SHOT BY POLICE. No longer is it unusual to hear about incidents in which police shoot unarmed individuals first and ask questions later, often attributed to a fear for their safety.V is for VIPR SQUADS, which are tasked with carrying out so-called  soft target  security inspections whenever and wherever the government deems appropriate, at random times and places, and without needing the justification of a particular threat.W is for WHOLE-BODY SCANNERS. Using either x-ray radiation or radio waves,scanning devices and government mobile units are being used not only to  see  through your clothes but to spy on you within the privacy of your home.X is for X-KEYSCORE. One of the many spying programs carried out by the NSA that targets every person in the United States who uses a computer or phone.Y is for YOU-NESS. Facial recognition software promises to create a society in which you can be tracked based on your face, mannerisms, social media and  you-ness. Z is for ZERO TOLERANCE, in which young people are increasingly viewed as suspects and treated as criminals by school officials and law enforcement alike, often for engaging in little more than childish behavior. The lesson being taught to our youngest and most impressionable citizens is this: in the American police state, you re either a prisoner (shackled, controlled, monitored, ordered about, limited in what you can do and say, your life not your own) or a prison bureaucrat (politician, police officer, judge, jailer, spy, profiteer, etc.).As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, the reality we must come to terms with is that in the post-9/11 America we live in today, the government does whatever it wants, freedom be damned.The choices before us are straight-forward.We can live in the past, dwell on what freedoms we used to enjoy and shrug helplessly at the destruction of our liberties.We can immerse ourselves in the present, allowing ourselves to be utterly distracted by the glut of entertainment news and ever-changing headlines so that we fail to pay attention to or do anything about the government s ongoing power-grabs.We can hang our hopes on the future, believing against all odds that someone or something whether it be a politician, a movement, or a religious savior will save us from inevitable ruin.Or we can start right away by instituting changes at the local level, holding our government officials accountable to the rule of law, and resurrecting the Constitution, recognizing that if we fail to do so and instead follow our current trajectory, the picture of the future will be closer to what George Orwell likened to  a boot stamping on a human face forever.

12099,REVEALED: Who Gave Democratic Emails To Wikileaks And Why They Were A Leaker And NOT A Hacker [VIDEO],"While all of the mainstream media and anonymous CIA sources claim that Russia was behind the hacks of the emails from the Democratic National Committee and top Clinton aide John Podesta, the truth has been revealed to be completely different.By way of background, top American intelligence veterans say that it was a leak, not a hack.A New York Times report on Monday alluding to  overwhelming circumstantial evidence  leading the CIA to believe that Russian President Vladimir Putin  deployed computer hackers with the goal of tipping the election to Donald J. Trump  is, sadly, evidence-free. This is no surprise, because harder evidence of a technical nature points to an inside leak, not hacking   by Russians or anyone else.Monday s Washington Post reports that Sen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has joined other senators in calling for a bipartisan investigation of suspected cyber-intrusion by Russia. Reading our short memo could save the Senate from endemic partisanship, expense and unnecessary delay.In what follows, we draw on decades of senior-level experience   with emphasis on cyber-intelligence and security   to cut through uninformed, largely partisan fog. Far from hiding behind anonymity, we are proud to speak out with the hope of gaining an audience appropriate to what we merit   given our long labors in government and other areas of technology. And corny though it may sound these days, our ethos as intelligence professionals remains, simply, to tell it like it is   without fear or favor.We have gone through the various claims about hacking. For us, it is child s play to dismiss them. The email disclosures in question are the result of a leak, not a hack. Here s the difference between leaking and hacking:Leak: When someone physically takes data out of an organization and gives it to some other person or organization, as Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning did.Hack: When someone in a remote location electronically penetrates operating systems, firewalls or any other cyber-protection system and then extracts data.Even the head of U.S. intelligence   James Clapper   testified on Monday that the connection between Russia and Wikileaks is weak. And U.S. intelligence agencies are now refusing to brief the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on whether or not Russia was actually the source of the Wikileaks documents.And the NSA executive who created the agency s mass surveillance program for digital information, who served as the senior technical director within the agency, who managed six thousand NSA employees, the 36-year NSA veteran widely regarded as a  legend  within the agency and the NSA s best-ever analyst and code-breaker, who mapped out the Soviet command-and-control structure before anyone else knew how, and so predicted Soviet invasions before they happened ( in the 1970s, he decrypted the Soviet Union s command system, which provided the US and its allies with real-time surveillance of all Soviet troop movements and Russian atomic weapons )   told Washington s Blog that the Democratic emails were leaked by either NSA insiders or DNC insiders.The former intelligence analyst, British Ambassador to Uzbekistan, and chancellor of the University of Dundee (Craig Murray) revealed earlier this week that the Podesta leak and the DNC leak were leaked by two different insiders, that both of the leakers were Americans with no ties to Russia, and that one was from the American intelligence services.Subsequently, Murray revealed further details on the leaks.Specifically, in an interview with Scott Horton on Tuesday, Murray said that   because John Podesta s company is a registered lobbyist for the Saudi Arabian government   the NSA and other intelligence agencies were monitoring their emails as a matter of course.Murray said that an insider from an American intelligence service (read: NSA) leaked the Podesta emails to Wikileaks. Indeed, an intermediary to the NSA whistleblower handed the emails to Murray in a park in Washington, D.C.Murray said that Wikileaks head Julian Assange tells him that the leaker of the DNC emails was a DNC insider.When asked if Seth Rich was the DNC leaker, Murray responded that he doesn t know   but that it s possible that Rich was murdered because someone thought that he was the source of the DNC leak.

Pay close attention to Assange s reaction when Pilger asks if he s suggesting Seth Rich was the leaker.Watch Assange s reaction to Pilger s question during the same interview in slow motion (below).

Why is MSM covering this up? #Trump pic.twitter.com/FS297JooQI  ViveLaFrance (@vivelafra) December 11, 2016Again, NSA is able to identify both the sender and recipient when hacking is involved. Thanks largely to the material released by Edward Snowden, we can provide a full picture of NSA s extensive domestic data-collection network including Upstream programs like Fairview, Stormbrew and Blarney. These include at least 30 companies in the U.S. operating the fiber networks that carry the Public Switched Telephone Network as well as the World Wide Web. This gives NSA unparalleled access to data flowing within the U.S. and data going out to the rest of the world, as well as data transiting the U.S.In other words, any data that is passed from the servers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) or of Hillary Rodham Clinton (HRC)   or any other server in the U.S.   is collected by the NSA. These data transfers carry destination addresses in what are called packets, which enable the transfer to be traced and followed through the network.The bottom line is that the NSA would know where and how any  hacked  emails from the DNC, HRC or any other servers were routed through the network. This process can sometimes require a closer look into the routing to sort out intermediate clients, but in the end sender and recipient can be traced across the network.The various ways in which usually anonymous spokespeople for U.S. intelligence agencies are equivocating   saying things like  our best guess  or  our opinion  or  our estimate  etc.   shows that the emails alleged to have been  hacked  cannot be traced across the network. Given NSA s extensive trace capability, we conclude that DNC and HRC servers alleged to have been hacked were, in fact, not hacked.The evidence that should be there is absent; otherwise, it would surely be brought forward, since this could be done without any danger to sources and methods. Thus, we conclude that the emails were leaked by an insider   as was the case with Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning. Such an insider could be anyone in a government department or agency with access to NSA databases, or perhaps someone within the DNC.For entire story Washington s Blog",politics,"Dec 19, 2016"

7793, Chris Rock Perfectly ROASTS Lily White Oscars: ‘You’re Damn Right Hollywood Is Racist’ (VIDEO),"There has been a lot of tension lately regarding supposedly  liberal  Hollywood s overt racism. Many influential actors of color have chosen to boycott the biggest Hollywood awards show of the year for those gracing the silver screen, but one person was obligated to be there because he was hosting   comedian Chris Rock. However, that did not stop him from making his feelings known on the matter.He said that white liberals   especially in Hollywood   could be what he called  sorority racist.  They aren t overtly hateful, but they still practice racism without even realizing it. He used the equivalent of rushing Greek organizations on college campuses as a comparison, saying in that epically funny way that only Chris Rock can: We like you Ronda, but you re not a Kappa. Rock also went on to make fun of the supposed efforts of the Academy to make sure there was more diversity in the coming years, in both voters and nominees. Then, the most awkward moment ever happened, when Rock introduced none other than Clueless actress-turned-Fox-News-talking-head Stacey Dash as the new director of the Academy s  minority outreach program.

She has said that channels like BET should be done away with, and has complained about the Oscars boycott. Those examples are just the tip of the iceberg, because she is clearly the last person Black America needs representing us in Hollywood or anywhere else. Then again, knowing Chris Rock, this was completely on purpose.The thing is, Chris Rock is right. This  sorority racist  stuff is what minorities all over the place go through daily in this white supremacist society.No, we are not a post racial America, not by a long shot.

He s been a fervent anti-Trump guy and has been very outspoken against President Donald Trump. His new protest song refers to Trump as a  con man . What a way to disrespect the leader of our nation! has Bruce Springsteen employed thousands of Americans? It s interesting that Trump just delivered one of the best ever speeches to the builders union. Please watch the video provided below of what a real working man does for his crew. It s an awesome speech that totally discounts everything Springsteen is trying to say to bash Trump. Shame on him!The 67-year-old rocker released his and Joe Grushecky s anti-Trump song, called  That s What Makes Us Great,  and it is a direct comment on the president and his administration, according to Pitchfork.Springsteen s part of the song goes as follows: Don t tell me a lieAnd sell it as a factI ve been down that road beforeAnd I ain t going back.And don t you brag to meThat you never read a bookI never put my faithIn a con man and his crooks.  During an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Gushecky talked about writing the song in January after Trump was sworn-in as president I had this song, and Bruce and I had been talking,  Grushecky said.  I sent it to him and he liked it. I said,  What do you think about singing on it?  He gave it the Bruce treatment. In February, Springsteen said he was an  embarrassed  American during a concert in Australia. On the same tour he attacked Trump s first travel ban as  un-American. Tonight we want to add our voice to the thousands of Americans who are protesting at airports around our country the Muslim ban and the detention of foreign nationals and refugees,  Springsteen told the crowd.  America is a nation of immigrants. This is fundamentally un-American. What a bunch of bull! Springsteen has lost his roots and his sense of the working man. If he cared to know anything about President Trump then he would know Trump s bringing back American jobs. He s working hard to get the steel industry up and running again. He just held a  Buy American, Hire American  event promoting keeping jobs in America. What s better than a president who s a builder speaking to builders and construction workers. In President Trump s speech he calls out people by name pretty great! He knows business and building. We re in good hands America!TRANSCRIPT: I want to thank Sean McGarvey and the entire governing board of presidents for honoring me with this great invitation. And I love that it s in Washington, because I don t have to travel very far. Worked out pretty well, I have to tell you. Five minutes.Sean took part in one of our very first meetings at the White House  - he mentioned it   and I promise you that America s labor leaders will always find an open door with Donald Trump. Always. (Applause.) Just look at the amazing talent assembled here. We have ironworkers, insulators   (applause)   never changes, does it, with the ironworkers? Let s hear it. Laborers. (Applause.) Painters. (Applause.) Fitters. (Applause.) Plumbers. (Applause.) Operators   they re operators, all right, I ll tell you that. (Laughter.) Electricians. (Applause.) Not that good. Where s my Local 3? Where s Local 3? That wasn t that good, the electricians   well, they became so rich they don t have to   (laughter)   let s do that again. Electricians. (Applause.) That s better.Bricklayers. (Applause.) Boilermakers. (Applause.) Elevator constructors. (Applause.) Good job. Sheet-metal workers. (Applause.) Roofers. (Applause.) Plasterers   plaster, well, yeah, that s   not using as much plaster as we used to, fellas, right? No matter how you cut it. Sorry about that. I m not sure I can do much   we brought back the coalminers. I m not so sure about the plasterers. We ll do the best we can, okay? We re going to do the best we can. How about the cement masons. (Applause.) And, of course, our wonderful Teamsters. (Applause.) Oh, that wasn t very good, James.But really, you re the backbone of America. With the talent in this room, we could build any city at any time, and we can build it better than anyone. (Applause.) But we re going to do even better than that. Together, we are going to rebuild our nation. (Applause.)You re the keepers of the great trades and traditions that built our country from the New York skyline to the Golden Gate Bridge. You represent the workers whose hands, skills, and dreams will build the great landmarks of our future. Every day, your members live out what I call the American Creed. They re on the job before dawn and after dusk, and they never quit until that job is done. You know that. True. True. (Applause.)We saw this grit on display when the construction trades helped rebuild New York City after 9/11. (Applause.) That was a terrible time   we were all there   that was a terrible time in this country s history. Worst attack in the history of our country. Worse than Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor they were attacking military. Here they were attacking civilians. Worst attack. And I saw what happened. Within a very short period of time, we were back rebuilding, and rebuild you did. And I really congratulate   that took a lot of courage and a lot of strength. Thank you. (Applause.)The fact is you take pride in every part of your work   every joist, bolt, and rivet. You re not only builders, but you re artisans, very talented people. A lot of people don t understand, you re very talented people   enriching our cities and landscapes with works of great beauty. And just as you take pride in your work, our nation takes great, great pride in you, believe me. And it s time that we give you the level playing field you deserve. (Applause.) Thank you. Thank you.Washington and Wall Street have done very, very well for themselves.Now it s your turn.And you re going to be also sharing the wealth. (Applause.) And you know, for many years, we ve been taken advantage of by other countries. All over the world they took advantage of us. We had leaders that didn t have a clue or worse. That s not going to happen anymore, folks. That s not going to happen anymore. And you see what s going on right now. In fact, the trade deficit went way down   just announced before I got on stage. And I will tell you, we re going to have a whole different set of values when it comes to representing our country.That I can tell you right now. (Applause.)This election was all about returning power to the people. I ve spent my life working side-by-side with American builders, and now you have a builder as your President. (Applause.) One of my first acts as President was to stop one of the great sellouts of the American worker   I immediately withdrew the United States from the disaster   this would have been a disaster   this would have been another NAFTA, which, by the way, is a disaster. I took you out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. (Applause.) Thank you. That one wasn t even close. And you know it and I know it, everybody knows it.Next, I cleared the way for the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. (Applause.) And it s looking like that s going to have about 42,000 jobs involved, those two jobs. That some number of great people. That s a big, big, beautiful   lot of people. And Sean actually, and a whole group joined me in the Oval Office when we approved the Keystone permit.And I joked that day   I said, can you imagine the head of this big Canadian company, in this case, they build pipelines   and they failed. Didn t work. They paid millions and millions and hundreds of millions of dollars to consultants and lawyers, and they failed. And it was over. And then one day Trump wins, and a few days later they get a knock on the door   sir, the Keystone pipeline was just approved.Can you imagine? I want to see the expression on his face. And he s a nice guy. He actually   they came to the office. (Applause.) Because I did say you have to use American steel, you have to fabricate it here. Now, they had already bought 60-70 percent of it. So you can t be too wild, right? But I was signing the order, and I said, where did they buy this steel? I didn t like the answer. I said, who fabricated the steel? I didn t like the answer. I said, from now on we re going to put a clause   got to be made in America. We want American steel, made in America. (Applause.) Right on the box. 100 percent, right? (Applause.)And you ll be hearing more about this in the very near future. But as time goes by, let s say, over the next seven and three-quarters years   meaning eight years   (laughter.)We believe in two simple rules: Buy American, and Hire American. That s what it s going to be. (Applause.) And that s not just a slogan, it s a promise. Believe me, that s a promise. (Applause.)The era of economic surrender has come to an end. It s come to an end. We have surrendered as a country to outside interests. The era of economic victory for our country has just begun. You will see. No longer will we listen to those failed consultants who ve made one wrong prediction after another   delivering nothing but soaring trade deficits and a big, fat, shrinking workforce.For decades now, we ve watched as our factories have shuttered   almost 70,000 factories   our jobs have been stolen, and blue collar wages have declined. We ve seen the economic pain inflicted on our fellow Americans in Pittsburgh and Detroit and Baltimore. We didn t just offshore our jobs, we offshored a big, big part of the American Dream.We enriched foreign countries at the expense of our own country, the great United States of America. But those days are over. (Applause.) I m not   and I don t want to be   the President of the world. I m the President of the United States. And from now on, it s going to be America First. (Applause.)We re going to bring back our jobs   and, yes, we re going to bring back the American Dream. As I traveled the nation, I heard the pleas of the forgotten men and women of our country   the people who work hard and play by the rules, but who don t have a voice. Together, we are their voice, and they will never, ever be forgotten again. That I can tell you. (Applause.)I don t know if you saw, but if you watch the Democrats now, the anger   the anger and hatred, and they re trying to figure out where did all these people came that voted for Donald Trump? Remember they said   because the Electoral College is a very, very hard, they say, almost impossible for a Republican to win. The odds are stacked. And they would say there s no way to 270   you need 270   there s no way to 270. I heard that so much for a year   I kept saying, maybe I shouldn t be running. You know, Sean, I said, maybe I shouldn t run because there s no way. The people are telling me   the same people that say all of the bad stuff, they re saying, there s no way to 270. But there was a way to 306.But wasn t that an exciting one? Places that nobody entered   Donald Trump has won the state of Michigan. They go, what? Donald Trump has won the state of Wisconsin. They came out of the blue, and we didn t even need them. And we love those two states   because we won the state of Pennsylvania, and we won Ohio, and Iowa, and North Carolina, and South Carolina, and Florida, and so many others. We ran the coast. And if you don t run it, you can t win. Huge disadvantage, Electoral College. It s very, very tough. They say almost impossible for a Republican to win. But I had the support of, I would say, I would say almost everybody in this room.We had tremendous   we had tremendous support. Oh, we did. We had tremendous support. (Applause.) We had tremendous support. And I ll tell you, we really had the support of the workers. We had tremendous support of the workers. But would you like to make a change, folks? Would you like to make a change? Because if anybody wants to make a change, you won t be having so many jobs. That I can tell you. Your jobs will be   it will be a whole different story. Because in the last decade, you lost over 750,000   think of this   750,000 construction jobs. Real wages in the construction sector have fallen more than 15 percent since the 1970s. We rank 39th in the world for construction permitting. And approvals for infrastructure projects can take up to 10 years.Since taking office, I ve signed one action after another to eliminate job-killing regulations that stand in the way. I had a chart   is that chart around here someplace? Do you have that? I have to show this chart to you because it s amazing, actually.This is   if you want to build a highway in the United States, these are some of the permits that you need. It s a process that can take way over 10 years. And it just never happens. Then at the end of the period they vote against it. And we re getting rid of many of these regulations. (Applause.) You have to go through 17 agencies, many permits in each agency.In February alone, we added almost 60,000 new construction jobs in the country. I ordered expedited environmental reviews for infrastructure, environmental and energy projects all across the country. No longer will you have to wait year after year for approvals that never come.I also took historic action to lift the restrictions on American energy production and to put our miners, who have been treated horribly, back to work. (Applause.) They re great people.Consumer confidence is at its highest level in more than a decade. You ve seen all of the charts, all of the studies. The National Association of Manufacturers just the other day reported the most optimism in the entire history of its survey   which is a old survey   93 percent of manufacturers are optimistic about the future. It was almost 27 percent lower than that just a few months ago.The Home Builders Confidence Index is at its highest level in 12 years. And now in breaking news, it was just reported today, the monthly U.S. trade deficit declined by 10 percent   for a reason. Not by accident, believe me. It was for a reason.We re also going to protect your jobs by protecting our borders. My administration is   just a matter of weeks, literally, a short period of time   has brought record reductions to illegal immigration. Record reductions. (Applause.) Down 61 percent since inauguration. General Kelly is doing a fantastic job. And we ll crack down on visa abuses that undermine the American worker. And we re doing that right now. (Applause.)These, and so many other great achievements, have defined our first 10 weeks in office. We ve done so much for the worker. Done so much for the military. We ve done so much for the police officers, our men in blue and women in blue who are not treated fairly. We re fighting for workers of all backgrounds and from all walks of life.But to achieve true progress, we must remember our legacy. We re the nation that built the tallest skyscrapers on what was once the Hudson River, and put neon lights of Las Vegas in the middle of the desert. But if government continues to punish America s builders, then we will not be that nation any longer.I m calling on all Americans   Democrat, Republican, independent   to come together and take part in the great rebuilding of our country. (Applause.)That is why, in my address to Congress, I called on lawmakers to pass legislation that produces a $1-trillion investment in the infrastructure of our country. And we need it. (Applause.) With your help, we can rebuild our country s bridges, airports, seaports, and water systems. We will streamline the process to get approvals quickly, so that long-delayed projects can finally move ahead. And with lower taxes on America s middle class and businesses, we will see a new surge of economic growth and development.All of you have come to the nation s capital to call members of the House and Senate to action. You ve also called your President to action. When you see them, you can tell Congress that America s building trades and its President are very much united. (Applause.)Together, we are ready to break new ground. We will build in the spirit of one of the great projects in our nation s history   an enduring symbol of American strength. The Empire State Building was forged in the Great Depression, and provided jobs for more than 3,000 workers. We ve all seen the pictures   rugged workers perched dozens and dozens of stories up in the air. Workers like these moved almost 60,000 tons of steel, installed 200,000 cubic feet of stone, and laid 10 million bricks to build that American icon. And they did the job in a record time   13 months. Hard to believe. Think of that   the Empire State Building built in 13 months, during the Depression. Nowadays, you couldn t even get a building permit or approval in that amount of time.When the workers had secured the last piece of steel in that amazing and beautiful structure, they marked the moment   as we still do today   with what is called a  topping out  ceremony: 1.050 feet above the streets of New York City, they hoisted a beautiful and great American flag. (Applause.)AUDIENCE MEMBER: The ironworkers!THE PRESIDENT: They did a good job. They did a good   those ironworkers, you better believe it.It was an American flag that represented American projects   the big, bold, and daring dream of one man, and then one city, and then finally, one people. That banner marked our nation s proud climb to the top of the world. Our people endured through the hardships of Depression and the battles of World War II, and they emerged from these trials stronger and more united than ever before. Now, we must again summon that same national greatness to meet the challenges of our time.Only miles from the halls of Congress and the newsrooms of Washington, you will find once-thriving cities marred by empty lots and once-booming industrial towns that have become rusted and are in total disrepair. Standing before me today, in this very hall, are the men and women who, if given the chance, can transform these communities. You are the citizens who can rebuild our cities, revive our industries, and renew our beloved country. And I know you will stop at nothing to get the job done. (Applause.)For the rest of their lives, everyone who worked on the Empire State Building knew when they looked up at that great New York skyline that they had lifted the Stars and Stripes atop the tallest flagpole on Earth, and that somewhere high above the city streets, their place in history was carved into beams of steel.In the future, when we become   the trials   and we are   trials of our times   we too will emerge stronger and more united than ever before. It s happening, you watch. When we rise above the cynics and critics who live only to defend the status quo, and to defend themselves from failure, then we, too, will construct a lasting monument to national greatness.In this future, our nation s workers and craftsmen will look way out at the vast open landscape, and they will build new bridges and new schools and new landmarks, and they will proudly raise up for all to see our bright and beautiful American flag. And when we see that flag, we will remember that we all share one American home, one American heart, and one American destiny.May God bless our nation s builders. May God bless our nation s workers. And may God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much. Thank you. (Applause.)",politics,"Apr 22, 2017"
18339,#YouveBeenTrumped…Journalist Who Tried To Nail Donald Trump Jr. On Russia Story For Over A Year Has Full-Scale Meltdown After Trump Jr. Releases Emails On Twitter,"This is the dumbest and biggest crime in the history of American politics. There's not even a close second.  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017It turns out little Jared was wrong. The Donald Trump Jr.-Russian collusion story is not only another nothing burger, it lends more credibility to the theory that the media is on an all-out witch hunt for President Donald Trump. Apparently, the hunt has now been extended to include members of the Trump family.Yates Sexton started his rant on Twitter by whining to his followers about chasing the story for a year, and how he got  Trumped  by Don Jr. when, much like his father, Jr. went around the media and took to Twitter to post the emails journalists were desperate to get their hands on.I chased this story for a year and he just tweeted it out.  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017Whining journalist part 2:Like. I spent hours and days and weeks and months. And his son just, hit tweet.  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017More whining:I tracked down sources. Followed so many dead leads. Labored over this. And then, he just, you know, tweeted out the proof.  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017Still more whining:Like, so many people out there were trying to track this down. And it just got delivered on a tweet. What the hell.  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017And you guessed it more whining!It's just so bizarre. As an independent journalist you work crazy hard hoping something will fall into your lap and he tweeted it? 2/  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017And then, the fake relief over the release of the nothing burger emails by none other than Donald Trump Jr. himself:For the record, I'm beside myself in relief that this stuff is out there it's just my god. I cannot believe this.  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017Yates Sexton then turned his ire on Trump supporters who apparently are (gasp!) laughing at the rabid leftist media who won t let the fake Trump-Russian collusion narrative go:The son of the president just released the smoking gun and the people are laughing about it on the news.  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017Poor Jared he s, well, he appears to be  baffled  by the Trump s and how they don t follow the rules that have been put forth by the media:This is the most baffling day in a long, long stretch of baffling days.  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017And finally, in an appeal to his leftist fans who are surely as heartbroken as him, Yates Sexton suggests that if his followers like his style of dead-end reporting, perhaps they would enjoy paying $22.69 for his book. And now for the final test Will love Trump hate? Will liberals feel help poor little Jared feel better about wasting over a year of his life, while he chased his tail, pinning all of his hopes on being  the one  who finally found the Trump-Russia connection.If you do want to read my reporting, however, here's my book that's out in September.https://t.co/02qE5K9PFv  Jared Yates Sexton (@JYSexton) July 11, 2017",left-news,"Jul 11, 2017"
8709, NYC Cop Under Investigation After Being Busted With Instagram Account Full Of Violence (TWEETS),"New York City Officer Matthew Langone sure does love his Instagram account. It is also the reason he is now facing an investigation.While off duty, Langone moonlights as a producer of pro-cop merchandise. There would be nothing wrong with this, except for one little fact: the merchandise blatantly advocates for police violence against members of the community. In fact, at least one t-shirt is the very definition of fascism.The latest shirt from the Langone collection boasts zip tie wrist cuffs shaped like a heart, with the slogan,  I [heart] protesters.  The  OT  in protesters is in blue, clearly promoting the widely popular police narrative that they rake in the bucks from all the overtime they get policing the ever-increasing number of protests. Keegan Stephan, an activist against police brutality, discovered the photos on Langone s Instagram account and uploaded them to twitter. Here is the image:Officer Langone of the @NYPD103Pct doesn't think much of free speech, except of course as ""OT."" pic.twitter.com/SGODDv8Nwh  Keegan Stephan (@KeeganNYC) January 12, 2016If you think that s bad, you ain t seen nothing yet. Suspecting more horrible content lay within the confines of Langone s Instagram, Stephan kept looking. He found it to be full of horrible memes and derogatory language directed at the very people this cop is sworn to serve and protect. Here are just a few:In fact, his whole instagram account is pretty unbecoming of an officer, imo, @NYPD103Pct. https://t.co/gABdz1zpHj pic.twitter.com/xM1myPSziZ  Keegan Stephan (@KeeganNYC) January 12, 2016To be clear, this appears to be an active duty cop w/the @NYPD103Pct posting this filth: https://t.co/gABdz1zpHj pic.twitter.com/zq9bSlGfNB  Keegan Stephan (@KeeganNYC) January 12, 2016It s the last meme, in which Langone refers to community members as  hoodrats,  that got the attention of Rory Lancman, of the Queens City Council. Lancman called on the 103rd precinct, at which Langone works as an active duty officer, for an investigation. Lancman said of the posts: I m deeply disturbed by the reprehensible Instagram posts of a police officer in the 103rd Precinct, which covers a significant portion of my district. It s completely unacceptable for someone who has sworn to protect our city to post messages advocating violence and referring to community members as  hood rats.  Such comments erode public confidence in our police and undermine our efforts to improve police-community relations. I urge the NYPD to take immediate disciplinary action and make it clear that such behavior will not be tolerated. But of course, the Blue wall of silence is always more important, than, you know, keeping the community safe from a cop with fantasies of fascism and violence and who clearly has nothing but contempt for the people who live there. The cops at the precinct only had this to say: We want to make sure that the posts are his. How many fake Instagram and Twitter pages are out there? Someone may have been putting this out in his name. How convenient. Even more insidious is that they have now blocked Keegan Stephan from following their precinct on Twitter. Stephan posted the proof:Wow, way to deal with the problem, @NYPD103Pct. pic.twitter.com/Vtugh5V76i  Keegan Stephan (@KeeganNYC) January 12, 2016I think, after this, it is safe to say that their  investigation,  will just be another in a long line of countless cases where they investigate themselves and determine that there was no wrongdoing.Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story",News,"January 17, 2016"
11697,BREAKING: TRUMP Announces “Phenomenal” Tax Cut Plan For Businesses In Next 2-3 Weeks…Stock Markets Respond [VIDEO],"President Donald Trump said his administration would be announcing a  big league  tax cut that would lower the burden on businesses within the next two or three weeks.The revelation saw the Dow Jones industrial average rise around 115 points to a record, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most gains. Lowering the overall tax burden on American business is big league, that s coming along very well,  Trump said at the top of a White House meeting with airline industry executives Thursday.  We re way ahead of schedule, I believe. And we re going to be announcing something   I would say over the next two or three weeks   that will be phenomenal. The president s comment had an immediate effect on the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies.The administration had gotten pushback a day earlier from conservative web site proprietor Matt Drudge, an influential media figure who Trump regularly lauded during the campaign. Republican party should be sued for fraud. NO discussion of tax cuts now. Just lots of crazy. Back to basics, guys!  Drudge tweeted, on a day filled with fallout from the Senate effort to silence liberal Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren.Tax reform has also been a top priority for House Speaker Paul Ryan and others in the GOP congressional majority, which has been anxious to slash taxes and regulations now that it finally has an ally in the White House.Trump has pledged to cut the top corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 15 per cent, but he offered no details on what his proposal might be. The value of the dollar against the Japanese yen jumped by 1 percentage point after the president s comments, Reuters reported. Airline stocks also spiked after the meeting. All three major market indexes jumped on news of the tax cut timetable.  Daily Mail ",politics,"Feb 9, 2017"

Our companies will not condone unpatriotic behavior!  said Jones, CEO of the payday lending chain Check Into Cash and owner of Hardwick Clothes   America s oldest suit maker.  For the 29 states we operate in, this isn t much to them, but it s a lot to us. The Tombras Group is our ad agency in Knoxville and our national media buyer for both TV and radio (for Check Into Cash) and don t look for Hardwick on the NFL either. Jones, a strong supporter of Trump, directed his media buyer, the Tombras Group in Knoxville, to remove any commercials for Check Into Cash, Buy Here Pay Here USA, or U.S. Money Stores from airing during NFL games  for the entire season.

Watch:The Story of Hardwick Clothes, Inc.Hardwick manufacturing plant is located on the outskirts of Cleveland, TN. The expansive new facility and modernized manufacturing equipment helped Hardwick stay competitive against an increasing supply of cheap, offshore clothing.Hardwick s reputation for American-made quality has helped the company survive and thrive in the face of outsourcing and cost-cutting. This status has helped Hardwick land contracts with a wide range of large clients, including the U.S. military and Major League Baseball umpires.Since its founding in 1880, Hardwick Clothes has endured factory fires, economic recessions, two World Wars, inflation and leisure suits. Despite these challenges, Hardwick Clothes has continued to produce unsurpassed suits, pants, and jackets for men and women, operating successfully with pride and quality.In June 2014, the company was acquired by Allan Jones, a prominent Cleveland, Tennessee, entrepreneur. Jones stated that Hardwick appealed to him because it was the oldest business of its kind in America. He announced his commitment to increased investment in the firm to help it regain its rightful status at the summit of the American clothing industry. ",politics,"Sep 27, 2017"

BILL MAHER CALLS Senator Elizabeth Warren “Pocahontas” During Interview [VIDEO],"Bill Maher began his interview with the yawn-inducing Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren and the best hope for a presidential candidate in 2020, by hitting her with some bad news Democrats are losing. After she came out faking enthusiasm for the liberal California audience, Warren who is best known for lying on a job application to Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania, where she checked the  Native American  box, starts out telling Maher,  People all across this country are energized.  (Is she talking about Antifa and basement dwellers who are collecting a paycheck from various George Soros groups for occasionally rolling out of bed, grabbing a face-mask and a baseball bat from their father s garage and going out to threaten the free-speech of Trump supporters?)Maher reminded her,  They may be all energized but they don t have a Democratic governor, a Democratic senator or a Democratic parliament. The first 5 minutes of Warren s yawn-inducing interview is filled with whining about how her progressive agenda is being ignored and how capitalism needs to be addressed and taken down.Maher quickly reminds her that from 1980-2015 when many of the economy-killing regulations were implemented that many Democrats were responsible for passing. He asked her,  Don t the Democrats bear some responsibility for that? At about the 6 minute mark, Bill Maher begins to whine about Trump s tax plan and reminds  Pocahontas  that Trump s fans are not with her. Warren tells Maher,  Actually, I m gonna push back, I disagree.  Maher interrupts her,  His fans are not with you. They don t like you Pocahontas.

6688, Alabama County Succeeds In Re-Instituting School Segregation,"The Republican-controlled southern states have done very little in recent years to scale back the impact of America s history of racism, from stubbornly supporting the Confederate flag on government property to retorting  All Lives Matter  to the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as dismissing all concerns posed by institutional, systemic, and overt racism prevalent throughout the country.In Sumter County, Alabama, a quarter of the county s children are white, but not a single one of them attends a public school. A report by Dan Carsen of a local NPR affiliate on the county s school district shows the schools are in terrible shape due to neglect and lack of funding precipitated by school segregation. They live in this county, but they will not send their children to the schools in this county,  Sumter School County Board Member Julene Delaine told Dan Carsen in an interview.  Instead, many white families send their kids to a local private academy or outside the area.  We shop in the same place. We eat at the same restaurant. So why can t our kids go to school together? Carsen also reported that while other states provide extra funding to low income school districts, Alabama does not. The state also refuses to increase taxes to compensate for the needed income. Alabama s Republican Governor, Robert Bentley, has gained a notorious reputation for corruption and abuse. He has recently been accused of having an affair with a political aide, increasing pay of his staff substantially despite the state s budget concerns after he blocked a minimum wage increase in the city of Birmingham, and is using over $1 million in taxpayer money to remodel a second Governor s mansion.In contrast to Sumter County s public schools, not a single person of color can be found in photos of Sumter County s  private school, Sumter Academy. The school s website also touts that it is a Christian based learning environment. Under the veil of emphasizing privatization over government ownership and regulation, the Christian Right has been able to succeed in inoculating themselves from having to adhere to federal laws protecting the rights of black people and other marginalized groups.Featured image courtesy of Flickr",News,"April 26, 2016"
14088,OBAMA’S SPEECH ABOUT “CHILD SAFETY” Was Interrupted When Rapper Guest’s Ankle Bracelet From KIDNAPPING Charge Went Off,"We told you about the fancy affair Obama was planning to host at the White House for black rappers last week. The latest development with the ankle bracelet on a criminal rapper makes you want to scream, Are you kidding me? An attempt by President Obama to promote his  My Brother s Keeper  initiative, which aims to keep youths of color out of trouble, came to a farcical end when rapper Rick Ross s ankle bracelet   which he received on a kidnapping and assault charge   went off.Obama had invited a bevy of hip-hop heavyweights, including Niki Minaj, Common, Busta Rhymes, Pusha T and DJ Khaled, to the meeting at the White House Friday.But none of them   least of all Ross himself   expected the ankle bracelet to interrupt the president, according to TMZ.Obama reportedly invited the stars to the  serious and fancy affair,  which was not made public before the event, to promote the initiative.It was so serious, in fact, that Ross, who is typically photographed topless to show off his impressive all-over body tattoos, wore a smart suit   and a pair of black Adidas sneakers.That suit conveniently covered the ankle bracelet that he received after last year s kidnapping, assault and battery charges. Unfortunately, it wasn t able to block the sound of his new anklet s random beeps   one of which went off just as Obama was finishing his speech.Even the self-styled  Hood Billionaire  was surprised at the sound, a source said.He later posted a picture of himself and DJ Khaled talking after the event on his Instagram account.

16875,DISGRACEFUL: US Air Force Can No Longer Afford 21-Gun Salute At Vet Funerals…Plenty Of Funds For Muslim Immigrants,"We can t afford to give our US Veterans a proper funeral, but we ve got money to burn when it comes to bringing Muslim refugees to the US from countries who hate us. On average, each Middle Eastern refugee resettled in the United States costs an estimated $64,370 in the first five years, or $257,481 per household. When a veteran or member of the armed forces dies, he or she is entitled to a ceremony that includes the presentation of a U.S. flag to a family member and a bugler blowing Taps. Most of the time, there is a three-volley rifle salute if requested by family members. But now, if the deceased served in the Air Force, the three-volley salute is not an option because the Air Force can no longer support riflemen for funeral services for veteran retirees.Seven member services for retirees included six members to serve as pall-bearers, a six member flag-folding detail, and a three riflemen to fire the salute. Veteran s funerals now only receive the services of two-member teams, who provide a flag-folding ceremony, the playing of taps, and the presentation of the flag to the next of kin. To me, without the 21-gun salute, it just does not make it complete a proper military burial,  veteran Wayne Wakeman told Honolulu s KHON 2 News.  I think because of sequestration or the lack of funds or whatever excuse they re giving, that they had to hit the veterans. Wakeman is correct in supposing the cut is due to sequestration, the 2013 automatic federal spending cuts required by the Budget Control Act of 2011.Rose Richeson, from the Secretary of the Air Force s Public Affairs Press Desk, told We Are The Mighty the policy of restricting the funeral honor is an Air Force-wide requirement. The requirement is consistent with DoD policy which require a minimum of two personnel,  Richeson said.  Any number of personnel above two that is provided in support of military funeral honors is based on local resources available.  Via: FOX News",Government News,"Jan 1, 2016"
4417, The GOP Just Revealed What They REALLY Think About ‘National Security’,"Congressional Republicans plan on dogging Hillary and the FBI about her emails and use of a private server from now until kingdom come. It s a matter of mishandling classified info, they say. She potentially put our national security at grave risk, they claim. We have to investigate every last letter of every last word of every last sentence here, they insist. But when it comes to investigating a true threat to national security, they re blocking attempts at every turn.Of course, we re talking about Donald Trump s potential ties to Russia. Congressional Democrats keep running into roadblock after roadblock in trying to open an investigation into that. GOP staffers told The Daily Beast that while it seems their bosses are privately concerned about the issue, they would rather continue harping on Hillary.It s politics. Disgusting politics that really does put us at risk. The problem is likely that Trump is their nominee which really should make it all the more concerning. Given the GOP s apparent need to protect our security (they re angry with Obama for not going after ISIS the way they want in addition to insisting that Hillary jeopardized our security with her email server), one would think they d be all over this.Intelligence briefings given to both the Senate and House Intelligence Committees point to Russia using hacking as a means to influence our elections: Communications and documents stolen in those hacks have been selectively leaked online since, by a hacker claiming to be unaffiliated with the Russians going by  Guccifer 2.0.  But analysis by private-sector cybersecurity firms have concluded that the character is most likely a front for the Russians to cast doubt on their culpability.Two other hacks   both of state election boards   have also been loosely tied to potential Russian hackers. In Illinois, thousands of voter role records were accessed, and Arizona was also targeted. Though nothing was done to influence elections in those states, experts believe Russian hacking is designed to cast doubt in the security and validity of the election. It s true that some Republicans are suffering some measure of  buyer s remorse  over the party s nomination of Trump, but in blocking investigations that are this important, all they ve done is unmask themselves as the impostors they are. To some, this is black-and-white. Kurt Eichenwald of Newsweek went on Twitter to call them out for this blatant hypocrisy:GOP Congress spends a year and a half investigating Clinton emails, but refuses to investigate whether Russia is hacking our election? WTF?  Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) September 30, 2016And he s got it. Republicans have attacked Hillary on everything under the sun because they hate her, and they fear her, and they don t want her to be president. It s not about national security with her. They won t go after Trump for something far more dangerous and frightening because they re protecting their own.

1418, Controversial Former Fox CEO Roger Ailes Dead At 77,"It has been reported that embattled former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes passed away this morning at his home in Palm Beach, Florida. The news was confirmed in a statement given to Drudge Report by his wife, Elizabeth Ailes. Elizabeth Ailes  statement on her husband s passing.Roger Ailes was born on May 15th, 1940 in Warren, Ohio. He attended Ohio University and graduated with a bachelor s  degree in radio and television. His long career in television began in 1962 as a production assistant for The Mike Douglas Show, a local talk show. In 1967, Richard Nixon appeared on the program, and Ailes argued with him about the political importance of television. That lead Nixon to hire Ailes to produce television for his campaign. After getting his foot in the door with Nixon, Ailes worked on two other presidential campaigns and helped Rudy Giuliani get elected mayor of New York City. He went on to become the president of CNBC in 1993, before being hired as CEO of Fox News in 1996. Ailes unique style of management and fearless approach to controversy have completely changed conservative broadcasting.Ailes was forced out of Fox News after allegations of sexual harassment came to light by some of the network s most popular and high-profile talent.A 2016 lawsuit by Gretchen Carlson alleges that Ailes retaliated against her for speaking out about his sexist treatment, denying her promotions and stalling her advancement.Megyn Kelly backed up Carlson s version of events, and went public with details of her own sexual harassment by Ailes when she was a young reporter.Lorie Luhn, who booked guests for the network, told of over 20 years of abuse. According her statements to New York Magazine, one time Ailes put her in charge of finding young talent for the network and told her,  You re going to find me  Roger s Angels.  You re going to find me whores. Andrea Tantaros was demoted and taken off of the air for refusing to hug Ailes.RNC field consultant Kelly Boyle was told by Ailes,  You know if you want to play with the big boys, you have to lay with the big boys.  Rudi Bakhtiar was fired by Fox after refusing to wear mini-skirts that Ailes sent her after a job interview in which he made her stand and show off her legs.Shelley Ross published an article in The Daily Beast where she detailed harassment and abuse she endured from Ailes, including suggestions that they form a  sexual alliance  in order for Ross to prove her loyalty.On the set of The Mike Douglas Show, model Marsha Callahan says she was told by Ailes that he could help her advance her career if she put on a garter belt and stockings, then lifted her skirt to show Ailes.Photo by Stephen Lovekin via Getty Images.",News,"May 18, 2017"

He s been saying all of these things as if he s doing all of this on his own without any help from anyone.Well, in a turn of events, Trump just tweeted out something on Twitter that seems to acknowledge, at least in parentheses, that he hasn t clinched the Republican nomination for president completely on his own.

10250,BROTHER OF SETH RICH Works For Cyber Security Firm…Reportedly BLOCKED Family’s Private Investigator From Determining If Seth Was Wikileaks Source…Refused To Let Investigator See Seth’s Computer: “I already checked it…Don’t worry about it”,"What the heck is going on? Why is the media, who has been virtually silent about former DNC staffer Seth Rich s death until now, coming out to attack President Trump and his administration, accusing them of pushing a false narrative about his murder? Shouldn t every American regardless of political affiliation want to get to the bottom of Rich s suspicious death? Why is there so much secrecy and mystery surrounding the staffer who was getting ready to move over to the Hillary campaign when he was murdered on the streets of DC, only blocks from his home early in the morning, after he was last seen leaving a local bar he frequented. The DC police called it a robbery. The  robbers  didn t take his wallet, the contents of his wallet or his expensive watch.Aaron Rich, who had reportedly been blocking his family s private investigator from looking into whether or not his brother Seth was a WikiLeaks source, works for an influential defense contractor that provides cyber security.According to a source close to the Rich family, Aaron works for Northrup Grumman, which was named as the fifth-largest defense contractor in the world in 2015. The source did not provide what his specific role is at the company. It s not just hacking and defending, there s a lot more to it,  a cyber software engineer at Northrup Grumman says in a video on the company s website.As we previously reported, Aaron Rich was actively attempting to shut down anyone looking into the WikiLeaks connection according to Rod Wheeler, who was brought on as a private investigator in his brother s murder case.Wheeler said that brother Aaron Rich tried to block Wheeler from looking at Seth s computer, even though there could be evidence on it.  He said no, he said I have his computer, meaning him,  Wheeler said.  I said, well can I look at it? He said, what are you looking for? I said anything that could indicate if Seth was having problems with someone. He said no, I already checked it. Don t worry about it. Aaron also blocked Wheeler from finding out about who was at a party Seth attended the night of the murder. All I want you to do is work on the botched robbery theory and that s it,  Aaron told Wheeler, according to Wheeler s claim on the audio. Wheeler said that Seth s father Joel  does not appear to have any hidden agenda. Rich was shot in the back in the early morning hours of July 10, 2016, near his home while he was on the phone with his girlfriend   12 days before the publication of the DNC emails by WikiLeaks. The police initially ruled that it was a botched robbery   but his wallet, watch, and necklace were still on his person when he was discovered by police.Big League Politics has also released an audio recording of journalist Seymour Hersh stating that Seth Rich was in fact WikiLeaks  source.Listen to the Seymour Hersh interview here: All I know is that he offered a sample, an extensive sample, I m sure dozens of emails, and said  I want money.  Later, WikiLeaks did get the password, he had a DropBox, a protected DropBox,  he said. They got access to the DropBox. Hersh also states that Rich had concerns about something happening to him,  the word was passed, according to the NSA report, he also shared this DropBox with a couple of friends, so that  if anything happens to me it s not going to solve your problems,  he added.  WikiLeaks got access before he was killed. For entire story: Big League Politics ",politics,"Aug 2, 2017"

19714,BREAKING BOMBSHELL: WEINER IS COOPERATING…FBI Didn’t Need Warrant…NOT Good News For Crooked Hillary [VIDEO],"One can only imagine what kind of relationship Hillary has with her very close top aide s soon to be ex-husband Fox News Sunday reported this morning that Anthony Weiner is cooperating with the FBI, which has re-opened (yes, lefties:  re-opened ) the investigation into Hillary Clinton s classified emails. Watch as Chris Wallace reports the breaking news during the panel segment near the end of the show:https://youtu.be/x13hBwS9q2cAnd the news is breaking while we re on the air. Our colleague Bret Baier has just sent us an e-mail saying he has two sources who say that Anthony Weiner, who also had co-ownership of that laptop with his estranged wife Huma Abedin, is cooperating with the FBI investigation, had given them the laptop, so therefore they didn t need a warrant to get in to see the contents of said laptop. Pretty interesting development. Targets of federal investigations will often cooperate, hoping that they will get consideration from a judge at sentencing. Given Weiner s well-known penchant for lying, it s hard to believe that a prosecutor would give Weiner a deal based on an agreement to testify, unless his testimony were very strongly corroborated by hard evidence. But cooperation can take many forms   and, as Wallace indicated on this morning s show, one of those forms could be signing a consent form to allow investigators to review the contents of devices that they could probably get a warrant for anyway. We ll see if Weiner s cooperation extends beyond that.Via: Red State",left-news,"Oct 30, 2016"
3789, It’s About Time! Twitter Just Kicked Off A Bunch Of Alt-Right Accounts For Hate Speech,"Twitter has finally decided to take action against the white supremacists running rampant on the social media platform. The same day the company vowed to take a stronger stance against hate speech, they suspended numerous alt-right accounts.Richard Spencer was one of those who was suspended. He runs the National Policy Institute, an alt-right think tank, and  has said he wants blacks, Asians, Hispanics and Jews removed from the U.S.  On Tuesday, Twitter removed his personal verified account, the account for the National Policy Institute, and his online magazine.Naturally, Spencer is losing his shit. USA Today reports: This is corporate Stalinism,  Spencer told The Daily Caller News Foundation. In a YouTube video, entitled Knight of the Long Knives, an apparent reference to the purge of Nazi leaders in 1934 to consolidate Adolf Hitler s power, Spencer said Twitter had engaged in a coordinated effort to wipe out alt-right Twitter. I am alive physically but digitally speaking there has been execution squads across the alt right,  he said.  There is a great purge going on and they are purging people based on their views. Paul Town, Pax Dickinson, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers were also banished by the Twitter gods.Heidi Beirich, spokeswoman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the organization had contacted the social media platform and asked that more than 100 white supremacists  accounts be removed for their incessant hate speech, which clearly violates Twitter s terms of service. They have done nothing,  Beirich said on Monday. It appears that on Tuesday, Twitter finally decided to do something.Beirich also pointed out that two of the alt-right accounts, including Spencer s, had been  verified.  This means Twitter has decided it is  an account of public interest. Twitter has stood up against the vitriol of the alt-right before, but this is the first time they have purged so many accounts in one fell swoop.Featured image via CS Monitor",News,"November 16, 2016"
18992,CNN INTERVIEW TURNS INTO SCREAMING MATCH When Activist Director Argues New “IRRELEVANT” Footage Of Michael Brown Is Game Changer [VIDEO],"(From CNN) New video captured hours before Michael Brown was killed shows the 18-year-old exchanging marijuana for cigarillos with the clerks of a Ferguson, Missouri, store, a documentary director told CNN on Monday.Director Jason Pollock, whose film  Stranger Fruit  debuted at the South by Southwest festival in Austin over the weekend, said the video shows that Brown did not rob the store before being stopped by police and that surveillance footage purporting to show Brown engaged in a robbery at the Ferguson Market and Liquor stores was actually video of Brown returning to the store to retrieve the cigarillos the clerks gave him. This is a shady store. We ve asked a lot of people in this community. You can buy weed at the store,  Pollock said. Pollock suggests that had this footage been released, it would ve altered the notion that Brown was shot after robbing the store. He learned of the footage from a St. Louis County police report that mentioned a video from 1:13 a.m. the day of Brown s death.In an earlier interview, in which he appeared alongside Brown s father, Pollock said,  What this video shows is that (police) lied to the world about what happened. They wanted to make Mike look bad, so they put out half a video to destroy his character in his death. Police say the new footage is irrelevant to their investigation. Investigators have previously said Officer Darren Wilson initially stopped Brown for walking in the street, not because the store reported a robbery.Watch CNN s explosive interview here:About 100 protesters gathered at the store Sunday night, forcing it to close, and gunshots were heard before midnight, but no one appeared to be injured, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.Gunfire erupted last night in front of the Ferguson store where Michael Brown was captured on surveillance video shoving the store clerk around, and now seen exchanging marijuana, as rioters gear up for a new fight in Ferguson.

2545, Trump’s Friend Snaps Pic With Guy Holding ‘Nuclear Football’ And Identifies Him On Facebook (SCREENSHOTS),"One of the guests at what Trump calls the  Winter White House    his private business in Florida  really got to feel the privilege associated with being able to drop $200,000 on a membership fee to gain access to the President on Saturday. Guests were treated to quite a bit of excitement when a call came in that North Korea had launched a missile and Trump read over confidential documents in full view of everyone as his white supremacist staffers held their cell phones  flashlights on it so he could see properly at the dinner table.Richard DeAgazio, one of the rich guests who somehow gets access to the President simply by paying him money, posted about watching Trump deal with the North Korea news   complete with photos of Trump reviewing information that is supposed to be secure.But that s not all DeAgazio posted! He also snapped a photo with the guy whose job it is to carry the  nuclear football.  Now the existence of the  football  is, of course, not a national secret.

But DeAgazio made sure our enemies know who has it, what he looks like, and what his name is. This is Rick He carries the  football  The nuclear football (also known as the atomic football, the President s emergency satchel, the Presidential Emergency Satchel, the button, the black box, or just the football) is a briefcase, the contents of which are to be used by the President of the United States to authorize a nuclear attack while away from fixed command centers, such as the White House Situation Room,  he posted on Facebook along with a photo of Rick, whom he says is the Man. All it costs is $200,000 and literally anyone is able to get within inches of access to our nuclear secrets   an interesting fact given The Donald s constant stream of attacks on Hillary Clinton simply for using a private email server.

Even worse, the show says that they were given access to Donald Trump, Jr. and recorded a 20 minute interview with him.The program is called  The Political Cesspool,  and has a considerable history and record of promoting white supremacist ideas and concepts.Political Cesspool radio host James Edwards wrote on his blog that he attended a Donald Trump rally in Memphis on Saturday night as a fully credentialed member of the media and enjoyed the unique experience of being able to air a live broadcast of The Political Cesspool Radio Program from inside the press pen while the event was in full swing. The host said that the interview with the younger Trump will be posted on their website on Saturday.He also bragged that Trump is the first Republican nominee he plans to vote for. After getting an official press pass, the white nationalists were given access to the press area of Trump s campaign rally. Edwards wrote,  After getting my start in politics with Pat Buchanan in 2000, Donald Trump will be the first Republican nominee that I have ever voted for. Buchanan was a man ahead of the times and Trump is his vindicator. Pat Buchanan is of course the former Nixon operative and NBC contributor who has written books excusing the Holocaust and praising Hitler.The Political Cesspool radio show has in the past argued that  interracial sex is white genocide  and  slavery is the greatest thing that ever happened to  black people.Trump recently triggered a national outcry by refusing to disavow or deny an endorsement from white nationalist and former Ku Klux Klansman David Duke in an interview with CNN host Jake Tapper. After being slammed for the failure to distance himself from a notorious racist, Trump concocted the claim that he was having problems with his earpiece and didn t hear the question.He made no such indication during the interview, and in fact repeated the terms  David Duke  and  white supremacist.

I ve got my tickets, and I m going to go no matter what,  Black said.  Because I want to be there when Trump touches the Bible and his hand catches on fire. Black went on to break the news to Trump that even Richard Nixon was able to land A-list talent for his inaugural ceremony by getting legendary entertainer James Brown to sing. All Trump has been able to get so far is Jackie Evancho, who didn t even win America s Got Talent.To make matters worse, Trump s team literally humiliated themselves by bragging about the participation of the Caisson Platoon and the famous army horse Black Jack. The problem is that Black Jack has been dead since 1976. Trump is  tweeting a dead horse,  Black quipped.Black then revealed Trump s inauguration them is  soft sensuality  which Black says is good because at least Trump is going to f*ck America  gently.

17399,"UNREAL! REPUBLICAN SENATE CONFIRMS ERIC HOLDER IN A SKIRT: ANTI-GUN, PRO-ILLEGAL, RADICAL RACIST WHO BELIEVES IN THE MURDER OF ABORTED BABIES BORN ALIVE","LISTEN TO THIS WOMEN SPEAK OF VOTING RIGHTS LIKE IT S 1960. WE DO NOT HAVE A VOTING RIGHTS PROBLEM.  LYNCH THEN SPEAKS ABOUT GOING INTO THE SCHOOLS AND CHANGING THE DISCIPLINE FOR MINORITIES VS WHITES   SHE S THE ONE WHO DECIDED THE MINORITIES NEEDED TO HAVE LESS PUNISHMENT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN. UNREAL! A Republican-controlled U.S. Senate voted to confirm an attorney general today who says that illegal aliens have a right to work in the United States but that partially born babies do not have a right to life.The Senate took two votes on the nomination of Loretta Lynch: first, a  cloture  vote to end debate and allow a final vote on confirmation, and, then, the final vote itself.Neither of these votes would have taken place had not Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell not brought her nomination to the floor for consideration. Thanks to a change in the interpretation of Senate Rule XXII that he Democratic leadership pushed through in 2013, only 50 votes (as opposed the historical 60) was needed to invoke cloture and end debate on the nomination. In fact, 66 senators voted for cloture including 20 Republicans.Lynch, who has been serving as U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, then won confirmation as attorney general of the United States by a vote of 56 to 43. Nine Senate Republicans voted to confirm her.At a confirmation hearing in January, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R.-Ala.) asked Lynch:  Who has more right to a job in this country? A lawful immigrant who s here, a green-card holder, or a citizen, or a person who entered this country unlawfully? Well, Senator,  said Lynch,  I believe that the right and the obligation to work is one that s shared by everyone in this country regardless of how they came here. And certainly, if someone s here, regardless of status, I would prefer that they be participating in the workplace than not participating in the workplace. Under the laws of the United States, which as attorney general Lynch will be responsible for enforcing, foreign nationals illegally present in the United States are not permitted to work here.In 2006, Lynch joined with a group of fellow former U.S. attorneys in signing an amicus brief submitted to the Supreme Court in the case of Gonzales v. Carhart, which sought to overturn the law that Congress enacted in 2003 that bans partial-birth abortion in the United States. Arguing that the ban should be overturned and partial-birth abortions permitted Lynch and her fellow former U.S. attorneys said that the language of the law, including the term  living fetus,  was too vague to be properly understood by those responsible for obeying it and enforcing it. Furthermore,  said the brief Lynch signed,  the ban s specific provisions, such as the phrase  living fetus,  are hopelessly vague as a legal proscription. It is unclear,  she and the others said,  whether a  living fetus  must be intact. A physician or prosecutor could not possibly know whether a given  overt act   kill -ed the fetus under the ban without having a clear definition of  living,'  wrote Lynch and her fellow defenders of legalized partial-birth abortion.In a 5-4 decision written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the court rejected the argument that Lynch had made.  The act is not vague,  said the court.In its opinion, the court quoted the description of a partial-birth abortion given by a nurse who assisted in one.The doctor, said this nurse (according to the U.S. Supreme Court),  went in with forceps and grabbed the baby s legs and pulled them down into the birth canal. Then he delivered the baby s body and the arms everything but the head. The doctor kept the head inside the uterus. The baby s little fingers were clasping and unclasping, and his little feet were kicking,  said the nurse.  Then the doctor stuck the scissors in the back of his head, and the baby s arms jerked out, like a startle reaction, like a flinch, like a baby does when he thinks he is going to fall. The doctor opened up the scissors, stuck a high-powered suction tube into the opening, and sucked the baby s brains out,  said the nurse.  Not the baby went completely limp. He cut the umbilical cord,  the nurse said of the doctor who had just sucked out the baby s brains.  He threw the baby in a pan, along with the placenta and the instruments he had just used. At her confirmation hearing, Lynch affirmed that she had signed on to the amicus brief opposing the ban on partial-birth abortion, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R.-S.C.) told her that that did not disqualify her from serving as attorney general. In 2006, you signed an amicus brief supporting Planned Parenthood s opposition to [the] partial-birth abortion ban. Is that correct?  asked Graham. Yes,  said Lynch.  I was one of a number of former Justice Department officials [who signed it]. Although, the amicus brief that we signed was focused on the issue of the facial issues of the law, and how it might impact the perception of law enforcement s discretion and independence,  she said. The only reason I mentioned that,  said Graham,  is that if there s a Republican president in the future, an attorney general nominee takes an opposite view on an issue like abortion, I hope our friends on the other side will acknowledge it s OK to be an advocate for a cause, as their lawyer. That doesn t disqualify you from serving. The 20 Republicans who voted to move forward on a vote with Lynch s nomination by voting for cloture included: Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Richard Burr of North Carolina, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Susan Collins of Maine, Bob Corker of Tennessee, John Cornyn of Texas, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Orrin Hatch of Utah, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mark Kirk of Illinois, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Rob Portman of Ohio, Pat Roberts of Kansas, Rounds of Kansas, John Thune of South Dakota, and Thom Tillis of North Carolina.In the 56 to 43 confirmation vote, 10 Republicans voted for Lynch. They included: Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Thad Cochran of Mississippi, Susan Collins of Maine, Jeff Flake of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Orrin Hatch of Utah, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mark Kirk of Illinois, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and Rob Portman of Ohio.Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas opposed the confirmation of Lynch, spoke against her confirmation on the Senate floor, and voted against cloture. But then he did not cast a vote on her final confirmation. His office did not immediately respond to inquiries about why he did not vote.Via: CNS",Government News,"Apr 23, 2015"
4484, Biographer Says Trump Might Not Actually Be A Billionaire: ‘He Just Makes It Up’ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s lies are catching up to him one by one, and the latest person to call him out is Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and biographer David Cay Johnston.Some of you may not know who Johnston is, but he is the author behind The Making of Donald Trump   so he knows quite a bit about who the erratic business mogul is and isn t. In a newly released video, Johnston claims that there is absolutely no proof that Trump is the billionaire he says he is   adding another layer of deceit and fraud to Trump s already horrendous track record.The clip was published by Business Insider, where Johnston goes through Trump s bragging claims and compares them to the actual data on the business mogul s court records and bank filings. For example, Johnston says that last year, Trump said his net worth was $8.7 billion, $10 billion, $11 billion and higher,  even though there was nothing going on in the economy that would suggest that kind of gyrations of net worth.  The truth is, Trump is lying though his teeth. Johnston said: The fact of the matter is that Donald Trump just makes it up. Johnston also brought up a court testimony where Trump said he uses his gut  feelings  and  emotional state  to determine his net worth. Johnston joked about how  nuts  it was, and imitated Trump s strategy: By the way, I m having a great day today. I think my net worth must be at least a billion dollars. Johnston has been trying to get America to believe that Trump s billionaire status was fake since 1990. During that time, a net worth statement by Trump s bankers said that the GOP nominee s net worth was actually negative $295 million.Johnston is still standing by the claim that Trump isn t as successful as he seems, and continues to insist that although Trump is well off, there is  no evidence that he is a billionaire.

18873,NY Teacher Gives Assignment To High School Kids: Come Up With Argument In Favor Of Mass Killings Of Jews,"A pair of high school students who take classes at SUNY Oswego via a specialized program are upset at an assignment their  Principles of Literary Representation  class received: Defend Hitler s Final Solution.CiTi/BOCES New Vision program teacher Michael DeNobile handed out a  Top Secret memorandum  to the class  addressed to senior Nazi party members.  It asked students  to put themselves in the shoes of Adolf Hitler s top aides,  according to a report at Syracuse.com.Students Archer Shurtliff and Jordan April, who ended up on opposite sides of the, er,  debate  wondered: Does DeNobile really want students to argue in favor of  the Nazis  justification for genocide? Although the lesson does tell students it is  not for you to be sympathetic to the Nazi point of view,  and is just  an exercise on expanding your point of view,  Shurtliff and April allege it created a rather intolerant atmosphere.One student did a Nazi salute in class, they say, and another said he wished he d been assigned the pro-Holocaust side  because Heil Hitler, duh. From the story:The students brought their concerns over the assignment to DeNobile, administrators in the New Vision program and educators at their home schools.The classroom assignment took them on a mission: To make sure no other student would be asked to argue in favor of killing Jews again.They carefully documented each meeting and conversation with their teachers. They researched other cases, including one in which a teacher was disciplined.They came up with dozens of alternate assignments and materials that didn t force kids to argue on behalf of mass killings. They contacted the Anti-Defamation League, which advocates for Jews.Within a few days, an alternative assignment was offered. Jordan wrote about America s AIDS crisis and response. Archer wrote about the internment of Japanese-Americans and compensation paid to survivors.The students said they weren t satisfied with the administration s response.They are calling for an apology, for the program to retract the assignment completely, and agree to never give it again.Despite the alternative assignment offered, many chose to stick with the original.Archer and Jordan say DeNobile and administrators defended the assignment, claiming they were told  the essay was a lesson in having to do things you don t like, and in seeing the other side of an argument. But Shurtliff shoots down this rationalization rather easily:  It s settled opinion. You can t say that Jews deserve to die. It should be a settled thing. In a letter to New Vision officials, Anti-Defamation League Education Director Beth Martinez wroteThere is no assignment that could ever be given to students that even hints at their [sic] being  two sides  to the  Final Solution /Holocaust that would be pedagogically or morally sound, and we are very disturbed that students are reportedly being asked to be a part of this.Indeed, the assignment says the objective is for students to go  outside [their] comfort zone  and to train their brains  to logistically find the evidence necessary to prove a point. High schoolers   vouching for the annihilation of an entire people is   merely going  outside their comfort zone ? Lovely.For entire story: College Fix",left-news,"Apr 3, 2017"
9345,"NORWAY’S TOUGH Immigration Minister BLASTS Sweden, WARNS Refugees: “If You Are An Economic Migrant” or an “Illegal Immigrant” You’ll Be Sent Home","Norway has a new immigration sheriff in town, and so far, it appears that she s singing the same tune as President Trump on immigration. And oh yeah, Sylvi Listhaug  doesn t give a damn  about her critics either. How far are bleeding-heart nations, like Sweden, France, the UK, and Germany willing to take this mass-immigration experiment, before they realize it s too late to turn back? Before her appointment to the cabinet on December 16, Listhaug, then agriculture minister, criticized what she called a  tyranny of kindness that is blowing over Norwegian society like a nightmare. It is very serious that politicians are using punitive measures that would make it more difficult for a number of asylum seekers who are entitled to protection,  asylum association spokesman Andreas Furuseth told the Norwegian news agency NTB.Listhaug said she wanted 40 or so major and minor asylum law changes submitted to parliament in February before the European spring season, when asylum seeker arrivals were expected to rise again.She told Norwegian NRK public television that her legislative package amounted to a  sharp retrenchment  on wide social entitlements previously granted to refugees.Some 35,000 asylum seekers arrived in Norway in 2015.It was a record for the oil and gas-rich Nordic nation of 5.2 million people, which in recent weeks saw fewer arrivals, in part because of border controls reintroduced in neighboring Sweden and the arrival of wintry weather.NRK said the proposed rule tightening would allow family reunifications only after the applicant had acquired four years of work or education in Norway.And, the government would issue voucher cards instead of cash for day-to-day items to prevent applicants from sending money to family back home.Migrants who arrived on transit visas via Russia would not be granted asylum.Older applicants in the 55 to 67 age group would be required to learn the Norwegian language and aspects of Norwegian society.Applicants who fail to present identity documents will be refused asylum. A grant of temporary residence would not automatically lead to permanent residence.  DWWhen Angela Merkel invited refugees to Germany in 2015, tearing up the rules obliging migrants to seek asylum in the first country they arrive in, the consequences were pretty immediate. Over 160,000 went to Sweden, leading to well-publicised disruption. Next door, things were different. Norway took in just 30,000; this year it has accepted just 2,000 so far. To Sylvi Listhaug, the country s young immigration minister, this might still be a bit too much. We have a big challenge now to integrate those with permission to stay in Norway to make sure they respect Norwegian values,  she says.  Freedom to speak, to write, to believe or not to believe in a god, how to raise your children.  Also, she says, what not to do. For example:  It is not allowed to beat your children in Norway. It s unusual for a European government minister to link immigration with child-beating, but the 39-year-old Ms Listhaug is accustomed to speaking plainly. The rest of Europe, she believes, is coming around to the Norwegian position.After decades in opposition, her Progress Party entered government four years ago, a junior partner in a Conservative-run coalition. Her party envisaged the problems of mass migration in the 1980s, she says, so was well ahead of the populist upstarts now haunting so much of Europe.  A lot of them are socialist parties but against immigration. We are a libertarian party. We want less government, so people should decide more over their own life. And we want a stricter immigration policy because that s important for Norway in the long run. While Sweden and others saw the migration of 2015 as a blip caused by conflict in Syria and Iraq, she sees it as part of an irreversible demographic trend.  Africa is going to gain almost 500 million more people by 2030,  she says.  Much of the Middle East and Africa is fragile. People have difficult lives but can see via mobile phones that life in the West and in Europe is quite different. So I understand why they would like our life, our kind of standards. But it s not sustainable to integrate so many. Why not? Norway, with its oil-generated trillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund, is one of the world s richest countries   and hardly beset by integration issues. This, she says, is because they ve been careful.  Many of the jobs here today perhaps will not be here tomorrow. Working in supermarkets for example   those kinds of jobs that don t need higher education. Those who come to Norway without any education   what are they going to do in the future if this continues? The case for limiting economic migration is clear. But about half of the registered asylum seekers in the EU, last year were from countries that were struck by conflict. Can Norway justify taking so few? Ms. Listhaug is a practicing Christian (albeit skeptical of the  thoroughly socialist  Church of Norway) and says her government s immigration policy, when combined with its aid policy, is not just a moral response, but the most effective moral response. For me it s a moral issue as well. You can t just help the ones you see. You have to think about the millions you don t see and that have a very difficult life in the world. She s referring to the refugee camps in Jordan, where both Norway and the UK send aid to help those displaced by war. Norway gave  23 million to its Jordanian mission last year, almost twice as much, per capita, as Britain. The cost of helping refugees at home is taken from its foreign aid budget, so as its influx subsides and costs fall, all savings are used to help refugees abroad. Some  370 million has been transferred so far, with more expected next year.So to Ms. Listhaug, it s not a question of whether to help refugees, but how best to do so. We meet after she visited Brandon Lewis, her British counterpart, who gave her a striking statistic:  The immigration minister here in Britain said that for the price of helping 3,000 young people here, he could help 100,000 children in other parts of the world. She sees this as a modern way to help asylum seekers   and more practical than the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, which obliges signatories to accommodate anyone with a  well-founded fear of persecution . It was an agreement for its time,  she says.  But when people travel through 20 countries to come to a safe haven, I think people can see that this is not right. You could have a safe haven in your neighboring country, so why go so far? Western countries that define their virtue by the number of refugees they let in, she says, also face a moral question:  Why should we have a system that works for the people who have money [to pay for the journey] while the rest of the refugees and people in need don t have the money to go? People traffickers, she says, thrive on governments that follow the old rules and accept those who turn up on their shores.  If you smuggle an unaccompanied minor from Afghanistan to Europe, they say it is between $3,000 and $20,000.  Young girls, she says, are sometimes sold to old men to finance such a journey.  Also, children are killed, or raped, on their way. So we need to have this under control. Ms Listhaug provoked fury in Sweden a few weeks ago by visiting a suburb in Stockholm notorious for unrest among its young immigrant population. She called it a  no-go zone    a phrase that the Swedes angrily reject. But she doesn t seem to mind causing a fuss, especially as she thinks her critics are coming around to her way of thinking. Nor does she mind using Sweden as a case study in what not to do.  A lot of countries in Europe are thinking more like us: like Denmark and Austria. Germany, as well  France has big problems right now with integration, as does Belgium. A lot of countries in Europe see that we need to have this under control. The Norwegian model, she says, is very different and very clear.  If you are an economic migrant, you are declined in Norway,  she says.  We send people back to Afghanistan if they are not in need of protection; we send them back to Somalia if they are not in need of protection.  Isn t this a rather expensive process?  Yes, but it s well worth it.  Police are also sent out to areas where illegal immigrants are suspected of living and working.  If we find them, we send them out. That has also decreased crime in Norway, that s very good. I ask Listhaug if she is getting used to being called cruel and heartless. How does it make her feel? Her response comes quickly:  I don t give a damn,  she says. She thinks her approach is right, and the consensus is wrong. And, as she says, an increasing number of other countries think the same. A new consensus might well be in the making.  SpectatorUKSo what do her neighbors in Sweden think of her tough positions on asylum seekers? The Swedish resident in the video below has nothing but praise for Listhaug. He openly praises her while mocking the  lefties  who have allowed out-of-control migration to destroy much of Sweden. In the video below, he reminds Swedes of the startling crime statistics they are facing: In Sweden, we have 10 times more car torchings. Do you want this? We have 4 times more violent killings than Norway. Is that what you want? Well, you should listen to your lefties, and be more like Sweden, It s interesting, the migration minister Sylvi Listhaug, came to Sweden to find out for herself, she wanted to find out what not to do in Norway.

Ted Cruz in the Republican primaries, but came aboard with Trump after he secured the nomination.Reached by The Cincinnati Enquirer, Blackwell said he could not discuss his duties because he had signed a non-disclosure agreement.Blackwell is familiar to Ohioans. He prevailed in an intra-party feud in 2006 to become Ohio s first black nominee for governor, but then lost in a lopsided race with Democrat Ted Strickland.He also took on fellow Republicans in the state Legislature while serving as secretary of state from 1999 to 2007. He also was state treasurer from 1994 to 1999.As chief elections officer, Blackwell played a pivotal role in administering the hotly-contested 2004 presidential election while serving as Republican George W.

21735,RECKLESS DEM MAYOR BLAMES AMTRAK ENGINEER FOR CRASH…UPDATE: New Evidence Shows Train May Have Been Hit By Projectile,"Perhaps Democrat Mayor Michael Nutter is taking a cue from the reckless DA in Baltimore in presuming guilt of the engineer without the benefit of an investigation. The Mayor basically accused the engineer of criminal negligence without even knowing all of the details of the crash. From Democrat Mayor Michael Nutter:  Clearly it was reckless in terms of the driving by the engineer. There s no way in the world that he should have been going that fast into the curve. Clearly he was reckless and irresponsible in his actions. There s really no excuse that can be offered. Listen to the Mayor s unjustified, irresponsible inflammatory remarks here:https://youtu.be/CBZxmmdp2Kg The Amtrak train that derailed Tuesday, killing eight people and injuring more than 200, may have been struck by an object before it careened off the tracks, an assistant conductor on the train told investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board.At a news conference on Friday, Robert L. Sumwalt, the safety board official who is leading the investigation, said an assistant conductor had reported that she believed she heard a radio transmission in which an engineer on a regional line said his train had been struck by a projectile and the engineer on the Amtrak train replied that his had been struck, too.Mr. Sumwalt said that investigators had found a fist-size circular area of impact on the left side of the Amtrak train s windshield and that they had asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to analyze it. He said that the F.B.I. had been called in because it has the forensics expertise needed for the investigation, but that it had not yet begun its analysis.He said that investigators had also interviewed the engineer and found him  extremely cooperative,  and that the engineer had said he was not fatigued or ill at the time of the accident. But he could not remember anything about the derailment.Investigators asked the engineer, Brandon Bostian, whether he recalled any projectiles, and he said he did not. He was specifically asked that question, and he did not recall anything of that sort,  Mr. Sumwalt said.  But then again, he reported that he does not have any recollection of anything past North Philadelphia. The assistant conductor, however, who was working in the cafe car, heard Mr. Bostian talking to an engineer on the Septa regional rail line who said his train had been  hit by a rock or shot at,  according to Mr. Sumwalt. She said she thought she heard Mr. Bostian reply that his train had also been struck. Right after she recalled hearing this conversation between her engineer and the Septa engineer, she said she felt a rumbling, and her train leaned over and her car went over on its side,  Mr. Sumwalt said.Jerri Williams, a spokeswoman at Septa, confirmed that the windshield of one of its trains had been shattered by a projectile near the North Philadelphia station about 9:10 p.m. on Tuesday, about 12 minutes before the Amtrak train derailed. We have reports of trains  being struck by objects in this area about two to three times a month,  Ms. Williams said. Mostly, she said, the objects are thrown by children and do no damage.The safety board has asked to interview the engineer of the Septa train that was hit by the projectile, and Septa is cooperating, Ms. Williams said.For days, speculation about the cause of the accident has centered on Mr. Bostian. Investigators reported earlier this week that the train accelerated suddenly a minute before the derailment and that Mr. Bostian applied the emergency brake seconds before the cars careened off the tracks, striking nearby utility poles.On Friday, Mr. Sumwalt said that the engineer, accompanied by his lawyer, had been open with investigators and had demonstrated a  very good working knowledge  of the proper procedures and speeds for the rail line, but that he did not remember the accident. He recalls ringing the train bell as he went through North Philadelphia Station, as required,  Mr. Sumwalt said.  He has no recollection of anything past that. Investigators said that Mr. Bostian had been  extremely  cooperative during his interview and that he had  reported no problems with his train handling. Two other conductors were on the train that night. A senior conductor is hospitalized, according to the safety board, and has not been interviewed.A junior conductor was in the back of the train and reported that his radio was not working, so he was unable to hear the engineer, Mr. Sumwalt said. He told investigators he felt shaking, then two large impacts that dislodged seats.Both conductors said they had confidence in the engineer, calling him  very professional.

That they have rules of engagement allowing them to unilaterally attack Russian aircraft at all seems unwise.Russian Major General Igor Konashenkov says he is  baffled  by the US reaction, saying the Russian jets were operating well within their safety guidelines, and that the US freedom of navigation near a Russian naval base  does not at all cancel the principle of freedom of flight for Russian aircraft.

O Brien asked Kunis to explain her  prank: I apologize if I m offending anybody. It s not so much a prank as much as I disagreed with some of the stuff that Pence was doing and was trying to do.

7628, New Republican SCOTUS Tactic: Who Needs 9 Justices Anyway?,"In a desperate bid to normalize the Republican Party s insane stance on keeping Scalia s seat on the Supreme Court empty, a new talking point is being tried out by conservatives: There s no time limit in the Constitution, and there s nothing magical about there being nine justices, [Dean] Reuter said during a panel meeting at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). The country started out with six justices, we ve had as many as ten at some point in time,  he continued.  As recently as 2010, when Justice Elena Kagan came on the Court, she had been solicitor general so she recused herself in over a third of the cases (so) I don t see a sense of urgency. I fully expect this to be repeated over and over again and eventually mimicked by the corporate media. If there s one thing besides crippling America that the GOP is really good at, it s making their sabotage seem perfectly normal. The corporate media is always a willing accomplice to this charade as they will tie themselves into knots to avoid calling out the historic extremism of the right.A side benefit of using this kind of rhetoric to keep the 9th seat empty for so long is that when a Democrat wins in November, they ll already have normalized a reduced Court. It s like stacking the Court, adding seats to dilute the power of one set of Justices, but in reverse.On the flip side, if Republicans were to somehow win in November, I wouldn t be at all surprised if they suddenly  realized  that 9 Justices just aren t enough and we really should have 11, 7 of whom would just happen to be conservative. For a group that calls themselves  conservatives,  ostensibly the party that preserves the status quo, the American right wing has zero interest in preserving tradition, precedent or the Constitution. They re only interested in preserving their own power at any expense.Featured image via Rational Politics",News,"March 8, 2016"
2361," Trump TRASHES Sean Spicer’s Cell Phone Checks, Signals Trump Team Implosion (VIDEO)","The Trump team is caving in on itself, and Donald Trump s latest comments certainly won t help.Earlier today, Trump appeared on Fox & Friends where he blatantly criticized White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. Addressing the mysterious and numerous leaks that have been coming out of the White House, Spicer was reported to be checking the professional and personal cell phones of White House staffers in the West Wing to make sure they weren t involved in leaking any information. It was a drastic move, and we ve never seen such distrust within an administration, and yet Trump still claims everything in the White House is running like a  well-oiled machine.  But something tells us that after Spicer hears what Trump just said, things are going to change.In his exclusive White House interview, Trump admitted that he wouldn t have handled the leaks the way Spicer did. Steve Doocey asked Trump: Sean Spicer asked his communication team,  Alright come on in everybody. Put your phone right over there. We have a leaker here. We re gonna have the White House lawyer look at your phones.  How intent are you on finding who the leaker or leakers are in your administration? Not just your communications team, but over at the State Department, maybe the intel community, everywhere? Trump first bragged about how great his press secretary was (even though there have been several reports that state Trump is unhappy with Spicer s performance and would rather replace him with a woman). He said, Well first of all, Sean Spicer is a fine human being. He s a fine person. Then Trump criticized Spicer: I would have done it differently. I would have gone one-on-one with different people. I would have handled it different than Sean, but Sean handles it his way, and I m OK with it. Hinting that he felt Spicer was going far too easy on staffers, Trump joked that if it were up to him,  there are things you can do that are a hell of a lot worse.

A few years ago, Cecile Richards went on television and said that if Planned Parenthood was defunded, women would lose access to services  such as mammograms.  As a former clinic director of Planned Parenthood, I knew this was simply not true.We scheduled our first  Schedule Your Mammogram Day  after that. We had over 10,000 people call Planned Parenthood. While we were hoping for an official statement from Planned Parenthood, they were silent.Just a couple nights ago at the Miss America pageant, one of the contestants stated that Planned Parenthood shouldn t be defunded because women would lose access to those dang mammograms.We figured maybe it was time to make some more calls. Hey, maybe Planned Parenthood started providing mammograms in house!? It s time to find out.We are asking prolifers everywhere to call your local Planned Parenthood clinics and ask to schedule your mammogram.GOAL: 20,000 calls!WHO CAN CALL? Anyone!

Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards says this wherever she goes.Planned Parenthood does not do mammograms. Lila Rose of LiveAction showed this by having people call dozens of Planned Parenthood facilities asked for a mammogram and being told every single time,  No, we don t do mammograms  and then being directed to a local clinic that does.No one has to take Lila Rose s word for it though, according to a dossier prepared by Americans United for Life,  As recently as 2012, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has confirmed that no Planned Parenthood clinic is authorized to perform mammograms.

In other words, the cereal maker does not want their company associated with a racist sexist publication that spews hateful right-wing propaganda.And they can t be blamed for that. After all, companies like Kellogg s want to sell their products to as diverse a consumer base as possible and giving a racist company like Breitbart adverting dollars only alienates.So Breitbart decided to get revenge by declaring war on Kellogg s and calling for a boycott. You know, because conservative boycotts always work.Yeah, that was sarcasm. In reality, conservative boycotts rarely work. In fact, they are usually mocked relentlessly and humiliated.

Kellogg s decision to blacklist one of the largest conservative media outlets in America is economic censorship of mainstream conservative political discourse,  Breitbart whined.  That is as un-American as it gets. Except that it s not un-American at all. Just like Breitbart is exercising their right to be total dicks, Kellogg s is exercising their right to not associate with them. It s called the free market.Despite being humiliated, conservatives are already crowing because Kellogg s stock price coincidentally dropped after Breitbart called for a boycott. So those of us who hate racists should go out and support Kellogg s by buying their cereal and other products to make sure Kellogg s is rewarded for rejecting hate. Because if Breitbart is allowed to successfully bully Kellogg s into supporting them, they ll do it to other companies who also do the right thing.Featured image via Twitter ",News,"December 1, 2016"
11805,BREAKING: Mexico’s President Cancels Visit With Trump Over Defending Our US Border From Lawbreakers…But Wrongfully Imprisoning US Marine Tahmooressi For “Border Violation” Was No Big Deal,"On March 31, 2015 Sergeant Andrew Tahmooressi was driving with his friends to go to a Mexican restaurant and accidentally missed the last exit before the Mexican border. Without the ability to turn around before he crossed the border, he proceeded to the Mexican customs post, where he explained that he missed the exit before the crossing, and volunteered that he had three US legal guns in the vehicle. After that, Sergeant Andrew Tahmooressi was arrested and charged with gun smuggling into Mexico.While we all understand the problem of illicit arms and drug smuggling between Mexico and the US, it is clear that Sergeant Andrew Tahmooressi was not part of it. He made an honest mistake, admitted it to the Mexican border agents, and was arrested anyway. His admission and cooperation with the Mexican authorities strongly attest to his innocent intent.Tahmooressi was released in November when a Mexican judge was finally convinced to do so on humanitarian grounds. His lengthy prison stay became a farce and a failure under the Obama administration, culminating in a September congressional hearing that was  highly critical of Obama Administration efforts to secure his release and Mexico s refusal to let him go. With the swipe of a pen on Wednesday, President Trump green lighted the construction of a border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and vastly increased the presence of border agents. Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto soon expressed regret over the new U.S. leader s actions and pledged to protect Mexicans already in the States. Where there is a Mexican migrant at risk that requires our support, your country should be there,  Pe a Nieto said in a brief address to his nation, which he said was a response to Trump s actions earlier in the day. Our communities are not alone,  Pe a Nieto said.  The Mexican Government will provide them with the legal advice, which guarantees the protection they require.The 50 Mexican consulates in the U.S. will be advocating on behalf of Mexicans, Nieto explained. He added (again) that he does not intend to pay for Trump s border wall. Mexico offers and demands respect as the fully sovereign nation we are,  he insisted.BREAKING: Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto says he has informed the White House he has canceled trip to Washington.  The Associated Press (@AP) January 26, 2017Nieto is apparently so distressed by Trump s executive actions that he is considering canceling their scheduled meeting for next week, where they were due to discuss not only immigration, but trade.Trump said that if Nieto is not willing to pay for the wall, he can go ahead and cancel.

7363, Samantha Bee Broadcasts American Atheists Trolling CPAC And It Is GLORIOUS (VIDEO),"The Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) is full of hard-right Christians who hate the usual groups of people that we ve all heard of that group hating   most notably, those who do not believe in the Christian god. So, to that end, the last thing they want at that particular event is a group of atheists. However, that is just who showed up to the 2016 edition of CPAC.David Silverman is with what is arguably the largest and most vocal secular group in America   American Atheists. He also ran a booth at CPAC. As you can imagine, this was not a well-received endeavor. However, being one of the most outspoken atheists in America has its advantages, and Full Frontal host Samantha Bee broadcast Silverman s trolling of righteous Christians at CPAC on her show, Full Frontal. What happened can only be described as brilliant comedy gold.Silverman s booth and display included signs with messages such as  keep your theocracy out of my democracy.  Silverman also broadcast his contempt for religion, saying: Religion is a lie. A scam. A con. It has no redeeming values and it has no place in today s society. There were also undeniable statistical facts in the clip that gave the message that refuted the idea that there are no atheists, especially since the number of non religious Americans is at 56,000,000 and growing. It warned believers: Stop saying,  Hey, atheists! Go away! The thing is, we atheists aren t going anywhere; in fact the opposite is true. We are the fastest growing  religious  group   especially among young people, including conservatives. This was evidenced by the fact that young conservatives began approaching Silverman s booth and listening to what he had to say. Silverman even referenced GOP frontrunner Donald Trump as a reason young conservatives are turning away from religion, saying through another animation: The conservative coalition, with its disparate components, has always been a platypus, stitched together with other platypi to create a platy-franken-pus. Now it s rotting at the seams collapsing into a festering pile of platy, frank and pus, feasted on by orange maggots. This oozing and tropic goo might present a nourishing culture medium for the atheists at CPAC, but many were unhappy to see them. The thing is, Silverman is right. Religion in general is quickly dying, especially the extreme conservative variety. The fact that a huge secular presence was at them most conservative event held each year is most ominous indeed for that movement, and great for ours. Good for Samantha Bee for broadcasting this phenomenon, and for David Silverman for bringing it to light.Watch the video below in all its secular glory:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"March 22, 2016"

2858, Trump Takes His Voter Fraud Conspiracy To A TERRIFYING New Level,"Donald Trump has been obsessed with the fact that he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton ever since the election results came in. Not satisfied with the Electoral College victory that handed him the White House, Trump has continued to double and triple down on an insane and unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that massive voter fraud is what cost him the popular vote.Well now, with the power of the presidency behind him, Trump has taken a terrifying step: Saying he will open a  major investigation  into the 2016 election. He also seems to be laying the groundwork for even more voter suppression and disenfranchisement of voters who are least likely to vote for him. He tweeted early Wednesday morning of his plans:I will be asking for a major investigation into VOTER FRAUD, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and .  Donald J.

This is just a way for Republicans to sow discord and deny facts, and to help assuage Trump s ego by allowing him to make himself feel better in this new world of  alternative facts,  that White House counsel Kellyanne Conway infamously pushed on Sunday.This is dangerous beyond anything we ever could have imagined. We have a conspiracy theorist as president, who also happens to be a narcissistic madman who cannot accept the truth. Even worse, he has people around him who are defending his antics, and who are perfectly willing to lie to the American people about the most trivial of matters.

16805,HUGE SECURITY LAPSE: International Flight Passengers Skip Customs,"Skipping customs at JFK might seem like a great thing for passengers arriving on an international flight BUT those passengers might be putting all Americans in danger by doing so. For the second time in a few months, a flight into JFK let passengers bypass customs. JFK is known to have a brutal customs time that can be up to two hours but the choice should be obvious just do it: New York remains the number one target for terrorists and it just made me think of Paris and how easy it would be for them to get in,  he said.  It s incompetence like this that could lead to another attack. Passengers arriving at Kennedy Airport on an international flight were allowed to exit the busy hub without going through Customs   for at least the second time in recent months.Bumbling airline and security officials let travelers on American Airlines Flight 1223 from Cancun, Mexico, out of the airport on Monday morning without having their passports or bags checked, sources told The News.The security lapse mirrored a similar incident involving another American Airlines flight in November.A 34-year-old man who had been in Cancun to attend three Phish concerts told The News he was able to glide from the plane to the baggage claim area without having to endure the usual maze of Customs and Border Protection security checks. It s absolutely absurd,  the business adviser said.  To think that anyone could be walking off of that plane and just get right into the city. It could be terrorists, El Chapo s henchmen, anyone. The jam band fan said he even approached a Transportation Security Administration agent near the exit, but was told he was free to go.A man who had been in Cancun to attend three Phish concerts told The News he was able to glide from the plane to the baggage claim area without having to endure Customs and Border Protection security checks.  I told them what happened and asked them what should I do,  the passenger said.  They said to me  That s fine, you re OK. Go ahead.   Several other concertgoers who were on the flight were already outside at the curbside cab line when he exited the airport.Neither the TSA, which screens passengers before they fly, nor the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, part of the Department of Homeland Security, responded to a request for comment.It was unclear how many of the passengers from the flight were able to skip the security checkpointsHours after the plane landed, American Airline officials pleaded with the Manhattan man   and presumably other passengers   to return to Kennedy and complete the customs process. I apologize for any inconvenience this may be for you; however it is a Customs requirement that every passenger entering the United States must clear Customs,  the airline wrote in an email sent to passengers. You could tell that they knew they screwed up and were desperate to get me to come,  the passenger added.The oversight sparked fears that terrorists could easily slip into the country without having to pass through any checkpoints. New York remains the number one target for terrorists and it just made me think of Paris and how easy it would be for them to get in,  he said.  It s incompetence like this that could lead to another attack.

7563, Another White Trump Supporter Assaults A Black Man At A Terrifying Rally In The South (VIDEO),"Enough is enough. It s time for Donald Trump to condemn this racist violence or be forced to end his campaign.For the second time in a week, video footage has revealed yet another incident of violent racism at the same Trump rally in North Carolina where an old white redneck sucker-punched a young black protester in the head as he was being escorted out the building by police.78-year-old John McGraw has since been arrested by law enforcement, but now it looks like police are going to have to hunt down and arrest another white racist who assaulted a different black person who, despite not doing anything wrong, was escorted out with other African-American attendees by officers who roughed some of them up for no reason.East Carolina University student Adedayo Adeniyi caught the terrifying experience on his cell phone camera on Wednesday as officers began scuffling with other black people in the stands around him. Hey that s not me, that s them,  Adeniyi says on the video in reference to being told he has to leave even though he wasn t even protesting.  I don t even know them! The cops, who are white, wrestle one protester to the ground and cuff him before leading him off. As Adeniyi is also led off down the aisle, an old white KKK wannabe tells him  Hey, f*ck you, baby, f*ck you!  And then physically assaults him by slapping him, and police didn t seem to care about that at all.Here s the video via YouTube.Afterwards, Adeniyi remarked that the incident made him fear for the future of America because it definitely looks like the country is embracing hate and bigotry. These are presidential candidate rallies,  he told the New York Daily News. I m not at a KKK rally. The fact that I experienced hate at a candidate rally tells you everything you need to know about Donald Trump and the people that support him. People will act more hateful and racist in environments that they feel not only encouraged to do it, but accept it as normal. The man at the end of the video is a moment I ll never forget. The hate in his eyes. The words. The hate in those words. The slap. It was disgusting and sad. At that moment I believed that America will stay and continue to be a hateful and bigoted country. Donald Trump s rallies are nothing more than glorified white supremacist rallies that are an embarrassment to this nation and those around the world. The fact that any candidate for political office here in 21st century America actually condones and encourages violence and racism against black people is sickening The fact that the police are serving as Trump s own personal guard and are allowing these acts of violence to occur and in some cases even joining in is just as disgusting. This is not the America any of us should want, but it s the one we ll get if people do not vote in November.Featured image via Flickr",News,"March 11, 2016"

11155,BILL O’REILLY ANNOUNCES 2 Week Vacation…Will Murdoch’s Liberal Son Who Pushed To Fire Roger Ailes Make His Vacation Permanent? [VIDEO],"Embattled Fox News host Bill O Reilly announced on Tuesday that he will be going off the air for almost two weeks, to take a vacation.The anchor s announcement comes amid an ongoing controversy over sexual harassment allegations made against him and a new report that James Murdoch wants him out of the company for good.The exodus of sponsors followed a recent report in The New York Times that five women were paid a total of $13million to keep quiet about harassment allegations.The accusations surrounding O Reilly, which date back 15 years, include claims of dirty phone calls, unwanted kisses and hotel room invites. The assumption is that he ll exit in a non-embarrassing way,  one senior Fox News staffer told the magazine.O Reilly declined to share where he was heading, but has launched an online contest for fans to vote on where they think his vacation destination is. He made the point that the time off was voluntary.Bill O Reilly kept his announcement to leave FOX News for a two-week vacation upbeat:The claims prompted 60 sponsors to drop advertising deals with the prime time show and led to an internal investigation.Four network sources told New York Magazine that it s possible O Reilly s getaway could turn into a permanent vacation.The Murdoch family, the owners of Fox, are reportedly split on what to do about O Reilly. Rupert Murdoch and his eldest son Lachlan are said to be inclined to keep O Reilly, while younger son James   the CEO of 21st Century Fox   wants to give him the boot.James also pushed to fire Roger Ailes amid last summer s sex scandal, and sources think he could be successful in weeding out O Reilly this time around.  Daily MailJames Murdoch is said to have convinced his father, 76, to  go green  in a major May 9 speech. In the speech, Rupert Murdoch sounded like Al Gore, saying that  Climate change poses clear, catastrophic threats  and that  We may not agree on the extent, but we certainly can t afford the risk of inaction. Marc Gunther of Fortune magazine commented that  Murdoch has boldly promised to make News Corp. carbon neutral by 2010 and to weave environmental issues and themes into his newspapers, TV shows, movies and online properties-a tricky business, particularly when it comes to news.

The group complains that conservative voices on Fox far outnumber  progressive  voices and that Fox anchors, reporters, and guests inject pro-Republican views into the shows.Murdoch s decision to hand the European and Asian operations of his company to his son James has been widely interpreted as a sign that James will soon inherit control of the entire company.

1580, Trump Accidentally Says He Wants Single Payer In Latest Tweet – Twitter Lets Him Know (TWEETS),"It can easily be said that Donald Trump is a few sandwiches short of a picnic, and he just proved that fact once again with his latest tweet.Trump, since the start of his campaign, has been telling everyone that he s going to get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something better, and quite honestly if his latest tweet is what he wants   liberals will likely get on board. However, in his idiocy, he probably doesn t realize what he just said.Trump tweeted out: Of course the Australians have better healthcare than we do  everybody does. ObamaCare is dead! But our healthcare will soon be great. Of course the Australians have better healthcare than we do  everybody does. ObamaCare is dead! But our healthcare will soon be great.  Donald J.

Please do!!Australia has a Medicare for all program for their citizens, and nations around the world have similar health systems that provide care for their nation s citizens. They take out the middleman of for-profit insurance, and give direct, affordable care, only increasing taxes slightly, and you no longer have the added expense of insurance premiums. AND EVERYONE IS COVERED.Now, this isn t likely what Trump meant to say, but it is what he said.The American Health Care Act, better known as Trumpcare, that passed yesterday in the House is simply a gift to the wealthy while stripping insurance and necessary benefits from those who need it most. That s NOT what Australia has, and would be far worse than anything else in the world.Twitter quickly reminded Trump that he s a moron:@realDonaldTrump Australia is part of the rest of the civilized world that has Universal HC.We can do better.#AHCA#FridayFeeling #TheResistance pic.twitter.com/X1K7f6mAg3  Holly O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) May 5, 2017@realDonaldTrump And why do you think that everybody else has better healthcare than we do?

8029, Bundy Militant Files $666 BILLION Lawsuit Against Government For ‘Damages From The Works Of The Devil’,"The moment the initial members of the Bundy militants were arrested, effectively ending the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon, one thing was for certain: as paranoid, anti-government conspiracy theorists, these people could be counted on for some absolute batsh*t crazy legal defenses. But no one could anticipate the sheer stupidity of their other legal filings.Shawna Cox, the woman who falsely claimed that LaVoy Finicum was executed with his hands in the air when in actuality he was attempting to pull a gun on law enforcement, filed a lawsuit against the big, bad federal government. Cox is seeking a whopping $666,666,666,666.66 in damages because she says the government harmed her in performing  works of the devil    including her attempted execution.KATU reports that Cox, who managed to convince the court to do her a special favor in allowing her to attend Finicum s funeral, quickly found her lawsuit tossed out because her claims are not cognizable in this criminal proceeding and will not be addressed in this case. Cox maintains that she did not interfere with public employees when she and her friends undertook an armed occupation of the Refuge because  it was their choice not to come to work out of guilt,  that federal employees were  secretly extending the boundaries  of Malheur, and says that she is being  maliciously prosecuted by the State and Federal Bar Association members because they do not want to be held accountable for their subversive activities against the people of the United States of America. No one is safe from her wrath. Cox says she will be asking the jury to  render civil and criminal charges against  a number of  public officials,  including  All of the Oregon State Bar members, and public employees who were involved in the persecution, prosecutorial misconduct, and ineffective council involving the incarceration of the Hammonds, including each and every one of them who violated the separation of powers and held offices in the judiciary and / or legislative and /or executive branches at the same time,  anyone who interfered with the  militia s  attempt to form an illegal and unrecognized Grand Jury to prosecute public officials, and  all involved in the ambush that attempted to execute myself and others and executed LaVoy Finicum. She also says she wants charges against  all state, public, and federal officials involved in organizing and authorizing the ambush execution of myself and others including LaVoy Finicum  as well as  all of the state employees involved in the ambush that attempted to execute myself and others, and resulted in LaVoy Finicum s murder. Cox specifically names Judge Grasty, Senator Cliff Bentz, Harney County Prosecutor Tim Calhoun, Governor Kate Brown, U.S. prosecutors Dwight Holton, Kirk Engdall, Kelley Zusman, S. Amanda Marshall, Judge Hogan, and Judge Ann Aiken as well as  officials who committed crimes against the Hammond family and myself by omissions and misprision [sic] pf felony s [sic],  Sheriff David Ward and Special Agent Katherine Armstrong.She says she is seeking the $666 billion in damages because these individuals subjected her to  damages from the works of the devil. If this seems nuts to you, you re probably right. These armed and crazed individuals declared war on the federal government, openly, and have essentially received a slap on the wrist for their anti-government efforts.Words can not describe the insanity of this woman s claims, so read them for yourself.

6916," PROOF: Republicans Are Blocking Black Voters, This Court Case Is Exposing Them","Voter identification laws (aka Voter ID) are an attempt by Republican lawmakers to suppress the vote with demographics that often vote for Democratic candidates   young voters, minorities, the poor. Often, when confronted with this, conservatives claim that the laws are in place to protect the integrity of the ballot against so-called  voter fraud,  but time and time again studies have shown that  voter fraud  happens so infrequently it is almost nonexistent.In Wisconsin, failed Republican presidential candidate Governor Scott Walker praised the recent implementation of voter ID in Wisconsin s presidential primary. But one case shows that the law is just a fancy, modern version of Jim Crow:Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker said his state s strict new voter-ID requirement worked  just fine  in the April 5 primary, but thousands of Wisconsinites were unable to cast a ballot because of the new law. One of them was Eddie Lee Holloway Jr.Holloway, a 58-year-old African-American man, moved from Illinois to Wisconsin in 2008 and voted without problems, until Wisconsin passed its voter-ID law in 2011.  I never miss voting,  he said. He brought his expired Illinois photo ID, birth certificate, and Social Security card to get a photo ID for voting, but the DMV in Milwaukee rejected his application because the name on his birth certificate read  Eddie Junior Holloway,  the result of a clerical error when it was issued.The Nation goes on to report that Holloway ended up spending $200 on records, made trips between two states, and was still unable to vote in Wisconsin. The U.S. Court of Appeals is currently reviewing a case brought before it on behalf of Holloway by the ACLU. The ACLU estimates that there are thousands of people in Wisconsin who have been disenfranchised like him.This is exactly what Republicans want. They ve said it on the record, multiple times, that voter ID helps them because it suppresses the vote. Their party best succeeds when less and less people get to exercise their Constitutional rights.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 14, 2016"
7691, These Hilarious Donald Trump Impressions Prove That Other Candidates Hate Him Just As Much As We Do (VIDEOS),"Republican front-runner Donald Trump does a pretty amazing job making himself look like a complete moron, but he s given us so much material that impersonating such a ridiculous candidate has never been more fun.Trump s a character that almost seems too insane to be real. From his accent to his hand gestures and facial expressions, we ve never had a more animated presidential candidate   and that might not be a good thing. He s become loathed by not only every logically thinking American, but by nearly every politician   even members of the Republican party!Because of his distinct (and revolting) personality, Trump has been impersonated by comedians, talk show hosts and more. Mimicking this candidate is so entertaining that even politicians   his own rivals   can t help but get in on it! Here are some epic impersonations that have been done by the other candidates, at Trump s expense:Hillary Clinton (starting at the 3:00 mark)We think Clinton took the prize here, doing a dead-on impersonation of the annoying yet unforgettable way Trump speaks. She even got some of the facial expressions right!Following Clinton are the impressions done by Trump s GOP rivals, who are understandably less charismatic and less intelligent than Clinton, but they still deserve some credit for trying   even if you end up laughing at them instead.Ted Cruz (at the 1:00 mark)Ted Cruz is creepy as ever, but he does a good job at summing up what Trump does during debates while at the same time mocking him for skipping one.Jeb Bush (at the 1:00 mark)You can tell that Jeb Bush, who recently dropped out of the presidential race, isn t used to being funny   but even he could barely contain his laughter as he tried to capture Trump s personality in a few seconds for Stephen Colbert.Rand Paul (at the :40 mark)Ex-candidate Rand Paul actually tried to mimic Trump s voice, and it was pretty disastrous. However, he did a great job reflecting Trump s misogynistic attitude toward women, as well as the front runner s inflated ego.Chris Christie Another former candidate, Chris Christie, takes a stab at Trump s voice as he bashes him during a speech. Interestingly enough, Christie has now endorsed Trump and was recently embarrassed tremendously by the business mogul   probably for this horrible impression.While these politicians should have probably left the impersonations to the comedians, we can t blame them for wanting to make fun of everyone s least favorite person. We can only imagine what it s like to work so closely with someone as irritatingly awful as Trump   so these candidates can blast him all they want.

9026," Donald Trump Gets Schlonged By His Own Ghost Writer, Who Refuses To Vote For Him (AUDIO)","When Donald Trump  wrote  a book in 2000, he didn t think it would come back to bite him on the ass.But that book, and the man who actually wrote it, have surfaced to draw a picture of a Donald Trump who is doing the total opposite of what he said sixteen years ago.Dave Shiflett did the heavy lifting on Trump s book  The America We Deserve,  and during an appearance on Fox News Radio with Alan Colmes, the ghost writer slammed the Republican presidential wannabe for being a total asshole who has completely contradicted himself in an attempt to become the GOP nominee. I used to think it was my first work of fiction,  Shiflett said of the book before remarking that it s hard to know where Trump stands on anything because he s a thematic person.Shiflett went on to describe how Trump used to hold very progressive views such as supporting single-payer healthcare and tax increases on the wealthy. He also mentioned how Trump ironically used to criticize Pat Buchanan for saying  too many outrageous and controversial things  to be considered a serious candidate for the presidency. In short, Trump once believed that being outrageous and controversial automatically disqualifies someone from being commander-in-chief, which means he would be disqualified himself since he has clearly adopted Pat Buchanan s style.And despite being Trump s ghost writer, there is no way in hell that Shiflett is voting for him.In the beginning of his campaign, Trump attacked Senator John McCain for being a POW during the Vietnam War, a war that Trump avoided by dodging the draft. McCain was captured after being shot down by enemy forces and he was then brutally tortured to the point where he can no longer lift his arms over his head. Shiflett has been angry about Trump s treatment of McCain ever since, and for good reason. I ll tell you what really bugs me about him, where it really ripped it with me and Trump was the stuff he said about McCain. McCain suffered severely, and I had a son who did two tours in Middle East during the last war and we had kids from here who went over there and some of them got hurt. They ain t gonna be the same. Here s the audio via Buzzfeed:Sounds like Trump s criticism of McCain was the last straw for Shiflett, as it probably was for many Americans. The fact is that John McCain is a war hero who sacrificed for his country, something that Donald Trump refused to do when he had the same opportunity to fight during the war. Instead, Trump chose to dodge the draft through multiple deferments, including a questionable medical deferment.Also, the fact that Donald Trump is using the Pat Buchanan playbook in his run for president is scary, especially since it appears to actually be working this time around 24 years after Americans rejected it when Buchanan sought the Republican nomination in 1992. This just shows how racist and sexist the Republican Party has become over the last two and a half decades.Featured Image: YouTube",News,"January 2, 2016"
4516, Pence Says There Is ‘Too Much Talk’ About Racism In Policing And Institutional Bias,"While Charlotte, North Carolina faces a state of emergency and unarmed black people continue to get shot dead by police, Mike Pence has a few words to say regarding the mounting racial tensions gripping this nation. To him, it s annoying   but not in the way one might think.As black people   who have done nothing wrong that warranted getting killed   lie dead in the street, Pence and Trump are annoyed hearing about it. How do we know? Because Pence was *smart* enough to admit it to reporters:Trump and I believe there s been far too much talk about institutional bias and racism within law enforcement.Gee, sorry black people dying and being targeted at disproportionate rates annoys you so much, Pence. Sorry the plight of black America is a burden to your message of  Build that Wall. Thirty-eight percent of the U.S. population is non-white. When a third of the population can fall victim to institutional bias and racism in law enforcement, the conversation (or  talk  as Pence puts it) is extremely important. Sorry if the talk makes your uncomfortable or triggers your prejudices, but it needs to happen. Skirting it under the rug or blaming it on drug use doesn t make it go away.The statistics tell us all we need to know:So, even with all these glaring statistics, Mike Pence thinks talking about it has been  far too much  for his and Trump s comfort.Newsflash, Pence: you re running for Vice President of the United States, not Vice President of the white community. If the talk is too much, get out of the race.We already know Trump doesn t care about the black community nor does he want to actually fix anything that afflicts it, but Pence was supposed to give the illusion that a potential Trump Administration would care. That s been shattered.Good luck getting the black vote in November when you completely wish to disregard what hurts them the most: systemic racism.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"September 22, 2016"

According to the letter, the attempt was unsuccessful.And now, Channel 2 Investigative Reporter Aaron Diamond has learned two more states  election agencies have confirmed suspected cyberattacks linked to the same U.S. Department of Homeland Security IP address as last month s massive attack in Georgia.The two states reporting the suspected cyberattacks were West Virginia and Kentucky. We need somebody to dig down into this story and figure out exactly what happened,  said Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp.In the past week, the Georgia Secretary of State s Office has confirmed 10 separate cyberattacks on its network over the past 10 months that were traced back to DHS addresses. We re being told something that they think they have it figured out, yet nobody s really showed us how this happened,  Kemp said.  We need to know. He says the new information from the two other states presents even more reason to be concerned. So now this just raises more questions that haven t been answered about this and continues to raise the alarms and concern that I have,  Kemp said.Through an open-records request, Diamant acquired the results of a survey Kemp asked the National Association of Secretaries of State to send to its members.West Virginia wrote back,  This IP address did access our election night results on November 7, 2016.  Kentucky responded the same IP address  did touch the KY (online voter registration) system on one occasion, 11/1/16. In a letter this week, DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson told Kemp the department sourced the mid-November activity in Georgia to a federal contractor conducting what he called  normal  internet searches on the Secretary of State s website. But Kemp says there s a problem with that answer. We haven t been able to recreate this the way they explained it to us,  Kemp said.Kemp also told Diamant that DHS has yet to explain at least nine other suspected network scans linked to DHS IP addresses over the last year on or around important primary and presidential election dates.

17135,SECRET DUMPS OF TOXIC WASTE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY BY EPA: Will The Government Bullies At The EPA Finally Be Exposed?,"This story gets more and more unbelievable every day The EPA has a record of releasing toxic runoff from mines in two tiny Colorado towns that dates to 2005, a local mine owner claims.The 3-million-gallon heavy-metal spill two weeks ago in Silverton polluted three states and touched off national outrage. But the EPA escaped public wrath in 2005 when it secretly dumped up to 15,000 tons of poisonous waste into another mine 124 miles away. That dump   containing arsenic, lead and other materials   materialized in runoff in the town of Leadville, said Todd Hennis, who owns both mines along with numerous others. If a private company had done this, they would ve been fined out of existence,  Hennis said.  I have been battling the EPA for 10 years and they have done nothing but create pollution. About 20 percent (of Silverton residents) think it s on purpose so they can declare the whole area a Superfund site. Like Silverton to the south, Leadville was founded in the late 1800s as a mining town and is the only municipality in its county. Today, tourism is its livelihood.It s against this backdrop that the Environmental Protection Agency began lobbying to declare part of Leadville a Superfund site in order to develop a recreational area called the Mineral Belt Trail. The project was officially completed in 2000, but apparently the agency stayed on and continued to work in town.In late 2005, the EPA collected tons of sludge from two Leadville mines and secretly dumped it down the shaft of the New Mikado mine without notifying Hennis, its owner, according to documents reviewed by Watchdog.A drainage tunnel had been installed at the bottom of the mine shaft by the U.S. government in 1942, meaning that any snow or rain would leach toxins into the surrounding land.Hennis said the EPA claims it has installed a treatment pond near the tunnel to clean runoff. The EPA rebuffed his demands to clean up the mess it created in his mine, he said. In frustration, Hennis sent the county sheriff a certified notice that any EPA officials found near his property were trespassing and should be arrested.Despite that history of bitterness, in 2010, the EPA asked Hennis to grant its agents access to Gold King Mine in Silverton because the agency was investigating hazardous runoff from other mines in the region. I said,  No, I don t want you on my land out of fear that you will create additional pollution like you did in Leadville,  Hennis said. The official request turned into a threat, Hennis said:  They said,  If you don t give us access within four days, we will fine you $35,000 a day. An EPA administrative order dated May 12, 2011 said its inspectors wanted to conduct  drilling of holes and installing monitoring wells, sampling and monitoring water, soil, and mine waste material from mine water rock dumps as necessary to evaluate releases of hazardous substances When the EPA hit Hennis with $300,000 in fines, he said, he  waved the white flag  and allowed the agency on his property.So for the past four years, the EPA has been working at the mine and two others nearby   all which border a creek that funnels into the Animas River. One mine to the north had been walled off with cement by its owner but it continued to leak water into Gold King. The EPA installed a drainage ditch on the Gold King side of the mine to alleviate the problem, but then accidentally filled the ditch with dirt and rocks last summer while building a water-retention wall.That was the wall that burst when a contractor punched a hole in the top on Aug. 5, sending a bright orange stream cascading down. The EPA looked like the Keystone Kops as anger intensified in the media and general public: 24 hours passed with no notification to the lower states or Navajo Nation; the White House ignored mentioning the incident; and it took a week for the EPA administrator to tour Durango downstream, while refusing to visit Silverton itself.The EPA says cleaning ponds have been installed to leach toxins from the water, and claims that anything released now is actually cleaner than before the spill occurred. The fallout from this disaster in the lower states is still unknown.Also unknown is the fate of Silverton itself. For months, the EPA has been pushing town leaders into allowing designation as a Superfund site out of belief that the whole town is contaminated. This is something the town has resisted, as its reputation is at stake and no current tests have shown any evidence of toxic soil levels. Whenever we hear the word  EPA,  we think of Superfund,  said Silverton Town Board Trustee David Zanoni.  They say,  We want to work together.  That s B.S. They want to come in and take over. The water up here is naturally filled with minerals. They don t need to be here cleaning up. If the EPA s litany of mistakes at Gold King mine is a barometer, Zanoni said, handing over the reins of Silverton would be a disaster. They had no contingency plan in case all of this went to hell,  he said.The EPA could not be reached for comment.Via: Watchdog.org",Government News,"Aug 17, 2015"

The stakes are very high [for the government] if they lose power,  he said, adding that many involved in illegal activities could be charged and taken to trial. The situation has become a matter of life and death for the government and also a matter of life and death for the people because people are dying because they don t have their medicines, the water they need.

From,  I d look her right in that ugly face of hers,  to A person who s flat-chested is very hard for them to be a 10,  Mirrors showcases women all across the country looking at themselves   their bodies, appearance   at their phones, wondering if they are worthy, as Trump s disgusting words echo off the screen.When talking about Kim Kardashian, Trump thought it would be a good idea to talk about her famous asset:  Does she have a good body? No. Does she have a fat ass? Absolutely. So presidential.The most damning part comes at the end, when Howard Stern asks Trump,  So you treat women with respect? Trump s answer? No, I can t say that either. This ad is so powerful. Trump, who is well known to be a serial misogynist, sexist, and all around pig, should be ashamed of the way he regards women, their appearances, and livelihoods. No wonder his first wife cited  cruel and inhumane  treatment as the grounds for their divorce, and called him a  chauvinist  on TV.Little girls, and indeed little boys, are watching. Their parents have a choice: do we elect a man who has a proven track record of demeaning women he doesn t even know, or do we elect a woman who wants to tap everyone s potential, no matter who they are or what they look like.Watch the powerful ad that showcases just how much of a pig Donald Trump is:Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"September 23, 2016"

20102,TARGET CAVES AFTER CUSTOMERS BOYCOTT Of Transgender Bathroom Policy Takes Toll Bottom Line,"Way to go! Target has suffered financially since the boycott over their  transgender bathroom policy so they re making a move now so little kids don t have to be exposed to transponders using their bathroom. Target reportedly plans to spend $20 million on adding single-stall bathrooms to all of its locations by next year, in an apparent move to placate shoppers outraged over its transgender bathroom policy. It s clear that some of our guests like and some dislike our inclusive bathroom policy,  Target Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith told reporters in a media briefing, Fortune magazine reported Wednesday.Ms. Smith did not say whether the backlash had cost Target business, but added,  We are not satisfied with our second quarter traffic and sales performance. The single-stall bathrooms, which are already in a  vast majority  of Target locations, are expected to be fully installed by March, Fortune reported.In April, the discount retailer sparked national backlash and calls for a boycott after announcing its transgender-friendly bathroom policy, which allows transgender employees and customers to use the bathroom that  corresponds with their gender identity.

2152," Trump Decides To Gut United Nations Funding By 50 Percent, Embarrassing And Endangering America On The World Stage","Donald Trump has decided to go through with his threat to defund the United Nations in retaliation for making a decision he didn t like.America has been the foremost leader on the international stage ever since World War II. After the war, the United States led the way in creating a more united and cooperative world by founding the United Nations to serve as a peacekeeping and humanitarian organization.The United Nations headquarters in located in New York and America has veto power and a seat on the prestigious United Nations Security Council.But now Donald Trump is preparing to slash funding to the United Nations by 50 percent, a move that would be a major blow against international cooperation and our reputation around the globe.Not only will the United Nations be cut by $5 billion, Trump s plan also makes a 37 percent cut to the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development budgets.And it s all in an effort by Trump to increase the already bloated military budget.United Nations expert Richard Gowan warned that cutting the funding would cause chaos and could cause agencies and programs within the United Nations to implode as other countries struggle to fill the gaps. Cutting the U.S. contribution would leave a gaping hole that other big donors would struggle to fill,  Gowan said.  Multiply that across other humanitarian agencies, like the World Food Program, and you are basically talking about the breakdown of the international humanitarian system as we know it. Indeed, the budget cuts could be devastating to the United Nations and threaten to bury international cooperation as we know it.Republicans have even drafted a bill directing Trump to withdraw the United States from the organization entirely.That means the United States would also be withdrawing from the World Bank, the International Court of Justice, the World Health Organization, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and the International Atomic Energy Agency, among many others.And because the United States is cutting funding, the United Nations may look to China or Russia to replace the funding, which could pave the way for a new power structure as the United States withdraws support.It s not only a serious blow to humanitarian efforts and global peacekeeping efforts, it s a serious rejection of international diplomacy and cooperation.And it s all because Trump and Republicans did not like that the United Nations passed a resolution condemning the continued building of Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory even though such resolutions have passed before.Trump is literally defunding the United Nations because they didn t comply with his demands despite the fact that President Obama was still in office at the time.This is absolutely humiliating for the United States and it should horrify the American people that Trump is withdrawing our country from the international community. Our influence and respect throughout the world will wane because of this decision and it will be difficult to regain it.America is once again becoming an isolationist nation, and the last time we ignored the world around us over 100 million people were killed in two world wars. By ignoring the world again and the growing humanitarian crisis, we are paving the way for World War III. And make no mistake, such a war today will make the first two world wars look like minor skirmishes.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"March 14, 2017"
2533, Hypocrite Republicans Refuse To Investigate Flynn Scandal,"After years of investigating Hillary Clinton over Benghazi despite her resignation, Republicans are hypocritically refusing to investigate Michael Flynn.Donald Trump s national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned late on Monday night after getting busted for negotiating with the Russians while President Obama was still in office.Flynn s actions violated the Logan Act, which bars citizens from negotiating with foreign powers. Flynn s connections with Vladimir Putin run deep, and the Justice Department warned Trump last month that Flynn was at risk of being blackmailed by the Russians. Still, Trump kept Flynn on his team and even let him continue participating in meetings.Flynn, the national security adviser, was literally a national security threat and Trump refused to act.This comes months after an election that was tainted by interference from the Russians, and Republicans have yet to investigate that.And they are not going to investigate the Flynn scandal either.GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz told reporters on Tuesday,  I think that situation has taken care of itself. I think he did the right thing stepping down. By that logic, the Benghazi investigation should have ended after Clinton stepped down as Secretary of State in February 2013. But Republicans continued the investigation into December 2016.Chaffetz then passed the buck by claiming that the House Intelligence Committee is responsible for investigating Flynn, not the Oversight Committee.When asked by reporters if he would launch an investigation, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes said he doesn t plan to do so and even went on to praise Flynn in the hope that the scandal will be swept under the rug.Here s the lawmaker who should be investigating Flynn and Trump s Russia ties, House Intel Chair Devin Nunes.Really taking this seriously. pic.twitter.com/ygfiajpYq3  Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) February 14, 2017And so, Republicans once again demonstrate that they are complete hypocrites.Republicans like Chaffetz spent years and wasted millions of taxpayer dollars to investigate Hillary Clinton over Benghazi. It was a witch hunt that went beyond the amount of time Congress spent investigating 9/11 and in the end it found nothing.Republicans literally accused Clinton of  national security malpractice  even though it was their cuts of diplomatic security funding that played a role in the lack of security at the consulate.Nothing Hillary Clinton could have done in response would have saved the four Americans who died in the attack. Furthermore, there have been even deadlier terrorist attacks against American embassies overseas that did not result in investigations, especially when such attacks occurred under Republican administrations.But Michael Flynn broke the law, lied about his phone calls with the Russian ambassador, and was a national security threat because of his closeness to the Russians, particularly Putin, and was at risk of being blackmailed.This is a major scandal of the Trump administration and the American people are demanding a lengthy and thorough investigation by Congress. The fact that Republicans don t want to do it shows how little credibility these lawmakers have. They don t really care about our national security. They only care about launching investigations for political gain.They are hypocrites and they should be ousted from office in favor of people who will conduct a proper investigation into this matter. And when that investigation exposes Trump s collusion with Russia we ll all know why Republicans didn t want to investigate Flynn. Because protecting the party is more important to them than protecting America.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"February 14, 2017"
2111, Trump’s Meeting With Germany’s Angela Merkel Goes From Awkward To Offensive In Seconds (VIDEO),"A sit-down meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel went from painfully awkward to downright offensive when Trump couldn t even muster an ounce of humility and grace. During a photo op, the two world leaders sat in stony silence as photographers did their best to try to capture a picture that showed some warmth between what are supposed to be two close allies. Instead they got Trump looking like his dad just told him they wouldn t be getting ice cream after all and Merkel squirming in discomfort.Trump s obvious irritability was bizarre to begin with, but his refusal to interact with Merkel only got worse. When a reporter suggested the pair give a handshake (as is customary when two leaders meet for the first time), Merkel leaned over to Trump to ask if he wanted to give it a go only to have Trump continue to stare straight ahead, ignoring her. She stared in astonishment, then resignation. The realization that the President of the United States really is this pathetic was written all over her face.Photographers: Can we get a handshake? Merkel (to Trump): Do you want to have a handshake? Trump: *no response* Merkel: *makes awkward face* pic.twitter.com/ehgpCnWPg7  David Mack (@davidmackau) March 17, 2017Trump could have been in a bad mood for any number of reasons. His healthcare plan is going down in flames. His budget cuts   which focus primarily on stripping funding away from the elderly and children in favor of more military spending   are getting some of the worst press since his Muslim ban. His second Muslim ban was just shot down by two federal judges. And his plan to accuse the British government of helping Obama wiretap him didn t just blow up in his face, but actually caused an international scandal. Or it could be the fact that Germany has shown zero interest in indulging his tantrums.Whatever the cause, America just got another clear reminder that the damage Trump is doing isn t just domestic. He s undermining relationships with crucial allies in ways that may take decades to repair. And he s not even willing to give a simple handshake to prevent it.Featured image via Twitter",News,"March 17, 2017"

18080,TWISTED LIBERAL KINDERGARTEN Teacher Allows Transgender Student To “REVEAL” Her “TRUE GENDER” To Class,"Silly parents you don t get to decide if, or when to talk to your kids about the .03% of the population who consider themselves to be  transgender.  And oh yeah your kids teacher will also inform your child that the gender they re born with doesn t matter, and that they can actually choose the gender they identify with.  Because liberal educators know better than you what s best for your child.The Rocklin Academy school board is facing tough questions from parents concerned over a controversial incident involving transgender discussions inside a kindergarten class. These parents feel betrayed by the school district that they were not notified,  said Karen England with the Capitol Resource Institute.WATCH:The incident happened earlier this summer during the last few days of the academic school year.At Monday night s board meeting, the teacher at the center of the controversy spoke out. With emotions high, she addressed a packed house. I m so proud of my students, it was never my intent to harm any students but to help them through a difficult situation,  she said.The teacher defended her actions to read two children s books about transgenderism including one titled  I am Jazz.  She says the books were given to her by a transgender child going through a transition. The kindergartners came home very confused, about whether or not you can pick your gender, whether or not they really were a boy or a girl,  said England.And many parents say they feel betrayed and blindsided. I want her to hear from me as a parent what her gender identity means to her and our family, not from a book that may be controversial,  a parent said. My daughter came home crying and shaking so afraid she could turn into a boy,  another parent said.The issue was not on the agenda, so parents spoke out during public comment. It s really about the parents being informed and involved and giving us the choice and rights of what s being introduced to our kids, and at what age,  said parent Chelsea McQuistan.Many teachers also spoke out in support of what transpired inside the classroom. They spoke about the importance of teaching students about diversity and having healthy dialogues.Unlike sex education, the topics of gender identity don t require prior parental notice.

Mexico isn t paying for his stupid wall. His Muslim Ban was shot down twice as bigoted and unconstitutional. Obamacare is still the law of the land. And he is known as the biggest recruiting tool ISIS has at the moment. Exactly why he thinks this warrants a party is unclear. But as can only be expected of a narcissist, he is somehow convinced that this is a great idea and it totally won t have an embarrassing turnout.It is worth pointing out that the day of Trump s  big rally  is the same night the White House Correspondents  Dinner will be taking place   without the man occupying the White House in attendance because the press hurt his feelings.On Friday, Trump tweeted that the 100-day mark is a  ridiculous standard.

14112,IMMIGRANTS FROM SOVIET UNION Want To Know Why Americans Support Bernie Sanders,"It s a pity the millennials who support Bernie Sanders have never had to stand in a bread line. They ve never had to watch everything their parents have worked so hard for, be taken away by their government. They don t make the connection that there s more to life than a  free college.  The huge deductions these millennials see on their paychecks usually takes care of the naive attitude of the immature, idealistic crybabies. People who escaped the former Soviet Union and came to America are not feeling the Bern. Perhaps because they know exactly what it s like to live in the socialist utopia Bernie Sanders wants for America.The Atlantic reports:Why Soviet Refugees Aren t Buying Sanders s SocialismSAN FRANCISCO Janna Sundeyeva still remembers life in the Soviet Union, where stores in remote regions would lack meat for months at a time and toilet paper had to be snatched up quickly on the rare occasions it appeared.But the minor indignities paled in comparison to what happened to her grandfather: He had the chance to come to America in 1929, but he opted to stay, sensing an economic thaw. Seven years later, Sundeyeva says, he was arrested and never heard from again.Sundeyeva immigrated to San Francisco from Moldova in 1994, and now she and her husband run a Russian-language newspaper here called Kstati. Her Soviet experience colors how she sees U.S. politics to this day. I don t like big government,  Sundeyeva said. She made two circles with her thumbs and forefingers and pressed them against each other so they touched, like binoculars. This Venn diagram represents the interests of people and government, she said.  They don t have very much in common. Today, she s not a registered Republican, but like many of the readers of her newspaper, she said she s starting to lean toward supporting Donald Trump for president. The other self-styled outsider in the race, though, holds no appeal for her. The only Bern she and many other Russians here are feeling is the one in the banya.To Sundeyeva, left-wingers seem to yearn for a workers  revolution.  I would ask them: Have you ever lived under a revolution?  she said.  Do you know what it s like? When someone comes and takes your family member in the night? Interviews with more than a dozen immigrants from the former Soviet Union in the Bay Area suggest that some in the community are recoiling from Bernie Sanders and his leftist ideals. One hundred years after the Bolshevik Revolution swept Communists into power, some Russians in America say they can t believe a serious candidate in the United States is calling himself a socialist.Many of us can t believe it either, folks.Bernie s support among young people can be chalked up to ignorance.

323, WATCH: Trump’s Treasury Sec. Steve Mnuchin Says NFL Players Have No Right To Free Speech,"Donald Trump is clearly violating the free speech rights of NFL players, and his weaselly Treasury Secretary supports it.As we all know, Trump has been waging a war against the NFL since calling quarterback Colin Kaepernick a  son of a bitch  on Friday night and demanding that NFL team owners fire players who kneel during the national anthem. On Saturday night, and into Sunday morning, Trump lashed out at the NFL in a tirade that made it clear that Trump opposes free speech and the Constitution that protects it.If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect .

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017That s right. Trump accused an American business of being anti-American for not firing players who kneel during the anthem in protest of police brutality and racial injustice. In short, Trump ordered the NFL to fire players who exercise their freedom of speech and expression. That means the government is now actively trying to force private institutions to silence and punish free speech.And Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin agreed with what Trump is doing, and even went full hypocrite by defending Trump s vile language. The owners should have a rule that players should have to stand and have respect for the national anthem,  Mnuchin told ABC host Martha Raddatz.  This isn t about Democrats, this isn t about Republicans, it s not about race, it s not about free speech. They can do free speech on their own time. The Constitution protects freedom of speech. This is something that Mnuchin clearly does not understand, which should automatically disqualify him from being in government.When asked about Trump s language, Mnuchin argued that  the president can use whatever language he wants to use.  In other words, white racists like Trump have freedom of speech, but black NFL players do not.Mnuchin then butchered the First Amendment even further by claiming that NFL players only  have the right to have the First Amendment off the field.  And that s complete bullshit.

5545, Seven-Year-Old Boy Accidentally Kills Father With High-Powered Rifle,"A seven-year-old Alma, Michigan boy accidentally shot and killed his sleeping father on Thursday night.According to police, the seven-year-old snuck out of bed while the rest of the family was sleeping. It appears that the family s guns were  safely  locked in a cabinet.Police say the boy found the key and used it to open the gun cabinet. He removed a high-powered rifle and the gun went off. A single bullet struck his father, who was sleeping in bed, next to the boy s mother.Officers and paramedics were called to the home a little after midnight. The man s injuries were fatal.The deadly shooting took place in a quiet neighborhood. Upon hearing the news, neighbors of the family said they were in shock. They had caution tape up and I saw three cops there,  one neighbor told WNEM. I m sorry to hear everything. It s a real tough time,  he said.Ellie Martin, a fourteen-year-old girl who lives next door to the family, told WNEM that she was  really freaked out  by what happened. I m not a religious person, but like, I prayed that everyone is OK. We don t have a lot of that around here,  she said.The girl went on to say, I just, I hope things get better for them. Not that there s any way of getting back up from that, but just so they can work through it and be OK. A third neighbor said he also has a seven-year-old child at home.  That makes me think a lot,  he told the news station.Contrary to NRA myths, having a gun in the home does not make you or your family safer. It seriously increases the risk that someone in your home will die from a gunshot wound.Even if you think a gun is stored safely and you believe that you ve taught your kids never to touch it, there s always a chance that you re wrong. It s a risk that is not worth taking.Featured image via Pixabay",News,"July 8, 2016"
2766, Trump Just Told Prince Charles To Eat Sh*t For An Absolutely RIDICULOUS Reason,"Donald Trump is slated to visit Great Britain this summer, and meet with Prince Charles while he s there. And the White House warned Prince Charles to avoid  lecturing  Trump on issues like climate change:Members of Trump s inner circle have warned British officials that it would be counterproductive for Charles to  lecture  Trump on green issues during the president s June visit to Britain, and that the president will  erupt  if pushed, the Sunday Times of London reported.Well, isn t that a nice way of telling Prince Charles to fuck off if he brings up climate change. One could even take that to be some kind of veiled threat, but it s more likely that came from Trump needing to feel like he knows everything about everything and doesn t need to be educated on anything.Trump is a known climate-denier and also has, ahem, a tendency to fly off the handle when anyone tries to tell him he s wrong, he screwed up, or basically doesn t kiss his boots and his ass. He still hasn t grasped the fact that he s the least popular person to assume the highest office in our nation, let alone that people won t immediately acknowledge his amazing intelligence and understanding of the world.He s been looking to pull the U.S. out of the big Paris climate accord as quickly as possible, even looking for ways to circumvent the four-year process for withdrawing. He believes that environmental regulations are harmful to business and that we must do away with them. He wants to do away with them so badly he scrubbed all mention of climate change from the White House s website the instant he was sworn in, and started gagging federal agencies directly involved with environmental issues to boot.Prince Charles, however, has not ruled out bringing the subject up, even though he ll probably try and work to avoid the appearance of  lecturing.  Sadly, though, Trump will probably see any talk that doesn t fit his views to a tee as  lecturing. The White House is treating Prince Charles like he s the egotistical know-it-all who should shut up and listen. But what can we expect from an administration that openly and loudly calls for members of the press to be fired for reporting facts they don t like?Photo of Prince Charles by Arthur Edwards -WPA Pool/Getty Images.

21867,(VIDEO) UNBELIEVABLE! BLACK JUDGE BERATES VICTIMS OF HOME INVASION AND YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHY,"You won t believe this judge and how he berates a family that was terrorized in a home invasion. Can a three-year old help how she feels after this traumatic event?The reason Judge Olu Stevens of Louisville, Kentucky berated a family that was terrorized by two black home invaders   in court and on Facebook   will knock your socks off. In all my years, I don t think I ve ever seen such an egregious example of race-card abuse.The judge was  troubled  and  offended  by the fact that a three year victim was so traumatized by a violent home invasion, she is now fearful of black males.Jordan and Tommy Gray s 3-year old daughter was watching  SpongeBob  when two black armed men broke into her home and robbed her family at gunpoint   one of the perps pointing a gun in her father s face.Mom and dad honestly noted on the their victim impact statement that she is still afraid of black men 2 years later. Whenever we are running errands, if we come across a black male, she holds me tight and begs me to leave,  the mother said.  It has affected her friendships at school and our relationships with African-American friends. Tommy Gray also wrote that since the crime, his daughter had been terrified of black males and that probation was not sufficient punishment for Gregory Wallace, 27, who had pleaded guilty to robbery. If holding a little girl at gunpoint gets you probation, then our system is flawed,  Gray said.But when Wallace was brought up for sentencing Feb. 4 in Jefferson Circuit Court, it was the parents, not Wallace, who suffered Judge Olu Stevens  wrath. I am offended.   I am deeply offended that they would be victimized by an individual and express some kind of fear of all black men,  he said. This little girl certainly has been victimized, and she can t help the way she feels,  he said.  My exception is more with her parents and their accepting that kind of mentality and fostering those type of stereotypes. The Grays were not in court as Stevens denounced their statements and granted probation to Wallace, whom he said deserved the opportunity to redeem himself.But they did see when Stevens condemned their statements again, in a post on Facebook. Do three year olds form such generalized, stereotyped and racist opinions of others?  he wrote.  I think not. Perhaps the mother had attributed her own views to her child as a manner of sanitizing them. That a supposedly unbiased judge would ask such an ridiculously biased  leading question  does not speak well of him.It s obviously true that three year olds generally don t develop  generalized, stereotyped and racist opinions (as if you could call her fears those things)  on their own.  This young tot had a little help   She was traumatized when a couple of black home invaders terrorized her family. Is this judge stupid?The family is obviously unhappy that the ordeal has negatively impacted their daughter s view of blacks. How did he miss that? It s why they listed it it on the impact statement.Later Stevens said,  I wasn t criticizing the victims, I was criticizing a statement that I thought was a generalization against an entire race of people. He was criticizing the feelings of a three year old victim of a crime. Shame on him. #SMDHMeanwhile    Wallace and his accomplice, Marquis McAfee, both 27, were arrested about three weeks after the robbery. Both pleaded guilty and McAfee, who was on probation for a prior crime, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, which he is serving.Assistant Commonwealth s Attorney Richard Elder objected to probation for Wallace, who pleaded guilty to a 20-year sentence, saying he was  guilty as hell  and  put a gun in that little girl s father s face.

3277, George H. W. Bush Writes Letter Showing Trump How To NOT Be A Corrupt President,"Former President George H. W. Bush can teach Donald Trump a thing or two about handling conflicts of interest.As January 20th approaches, Donald Trump is apparently poised to violate the Constitution the moment he finishes reciting the oath of office because he has yet to properly eliminate the conflicts of interest between himself and his family business.Public officials are not allowed to use their office to to influence policies that would increase profits of a company they have a personal stake in. By not putting his assets, including the Trump Organization and any stocks he owns, into a blind trust or sells them off, Trump is violating the the Emoluments Clause and breaking decades of precedent.The most example is when Jimmy Carter sold the peanut business he built from the ground up to avoid conflicts of interest. Of course, Republicans initiated a series of witch hunts against Carter s business anyway in a desperate effort to find a scandal. Today, Republicans don t care if Trump continues to own his business, even though he is already using the presidency to make business deals and bring in profits.Indeed, when Ivanka Trump sat in during a meeting between her father and the Japanese Prime Minister, her company was in the middle of working on a deal with a Japanese company.As Newsweek explained,At the same time, officials with her clothing company were working on a licensing agreement with Sanei International. The largest shareholder of Sanei s parent company is the Development Bank of Japan, which is wholly owned by the Japanese government headed by Abe.Trump has also talked to the president of Taiwan and the leader of Argentina, where Trump s company is trying to secure deals to build hotels. Clearly, Trump is flagrantly using the presidency to enrich himself and his company.George H.W. Bush warned his own family not to do this or even make it appear that they are doing it by sending each family member a letter in 1988 in the midst of the presidential election.The elder Bush told his family that people are going to try to be their friend but that  friendship  could result in asking for favors simply because they are connected to the leader of the free world. If there is a legitimate inquiry, call my office,  Bush wrote.  It is certainly appropriate to contact your own government, but let s do it through my office so no one can accuse any of the family of trying to use influence. In other words, Bush told his family not to call him on their friend s behalf. They have to call his office themselves.Bush knew all too well that,  Every effort will be made to find some phone call, some inquiry, some letter that can be made to appear improper. Here s the full letter via Twitter.pic.twitter.com/60GKf4QIIJ  Eric Lipton (@EricLiptonNYT) December 21, 2016Donald Trump, however, is influenced by his business and since his children are deeply involved in the company, that means they ll have special access to him and will be able to curry favors such as asking him to gut certain regulations or asking him to call certain foreign leaders to push through business deals.That s a serious ethics violation that cannot be tolerated. Hell, Eric Trump has already been busted trying to sell access to his father in exchange for $1 million donations to his fraudulent charity. So it s pretty clear that there is already a pay-for-play scandal brewing before Trump has even taken office.This needs to stop now and the only way it will stop is if Trump sells his company or puts it into a blind trust. Anything less is unacceptable.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"December 24, 2016"
11050,LAURA INGRAHAM: GOP Senior Senators “Laughed Out Loud” At Building Border Wall…”Actively Working Against” Trump [Video],"Laura Ingraham reported to Sean Hannity that Republican leaders don t want the border wall built and are actively working against Preisdent Trump One thing I know for sure, Sean, is that we have way too many people on Capitol Hill who are not on the president s side of this. I m talking Republicans. So I have no doubt in my mind that Donald Trump wants this wall to be built. Congress has to appropriate the money. I heard over two months ago that GOP leadership, the most senior senators on Capitol Hill, and I heard it from someone who was in the room with them, they were laughing at an idea a wall would ever get built. Out loud laughing. They were recently telling that source of mine,  Don t worry, it s not going to happen. In the mean time, Lou Dobbs gives a classic take down of Paul Ryan:Yes, just get out of the way!BORDER RANCHERS VOUCH FOR BUILDING THE WALL:Fred Davis and John Ladd are two Arizona ranchers who were guests on Fox & Friends to tell their story of what its like to be on the front lines at the border:REPORT: THE COST TO YOU FOR NOT BUILDING THE WALL (Note that this report is from 2013!):The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on United States TaxpayersThis report estimates the annual costs of illegal immigration at the federal, state and local level to be about $113 billion; nearly $29 billion at the federal level and $84 billion at the state and local level.The study also estimates tax collections from illegal alien workers, both those in the above-ground economy and those in the underground economy.Those receipts do not come close to the level of expenditures and, in any case, are misleading as an offset because over time unemployed and underemployed U.S. workers would replace illegal alien workers.Key FindingsIllegal immigration costs U.S. taxpayers about $113 billion a year at the federal, state and local level. The bulk of the costs   some $84 billion   are absorbed by state and local governments.The annual outlay that illegal aliens cost U.S. taxpayers is an average amount per native-headed household of $1,117.The fiscal impact per household varies considerably because the greatest share of the burden falls on state and local taxpayers whose burden depends on the size of the illegal alien population in that localityEducation for the children of illegal aliens constitutes the single largest cost to taxpayers, at an annual price tag of nearly $52 billion. Nearly all of those costs are absorbed by state and local governments.At the federal level, about one-third of outlays are matched by tax collections from illegal aliens.At the state and local level, an average of less than 5 percent of the public costs associated with illegal immigration is recouped through taxes collected from illegal aliens.Most illegal aliens do not pay income taxes. Among those who do, much of the revenues collected are refunded to the illegal aliens when they file tax returns.Many are also claiming tax credits resulting in payments from the U.S. Treasury.With many state budgets in deficit, policymakers have an obligation to look for ways to reduce the fiscal burden of illegal migration. California, facing a budget deficit of $14.4 billion in 2010-2011, is hit with an estimated $21.8 billion in annual expenditures on illegal aliens. New York s $6.8 billion deficit is smaller than its $9.5 billion in yearly illegal alien costs.The report examines the likely consequences if an amnesty for the illegal alien population were adopted similar to the one adopted in 1986. The report notes that while tax collections from the illegal alien population would likely increase only marginally, the new legal status would make them eligible for receiving Social Security retirement benefits that would further jeopardize the future of the already shaky system.An amnesty would also result in this large population of illegal aliens becoming eligible for numerous social assistance programs available for low-income populations for which they are not now eligible. The overall result would, therefore, be an accentuation of the already enormous fiscal burden.Read more: FAIR",politics,"Apr 26, 2017"

21332,ADMINISTRATORS FACE BACKLASH After Florida Middle School Organizes Segregated Field Trip For Blacks Only," We didn t mean to send a negative message. We wanted to be positive.  Yeah because telling Asians, Whites and Hispanics to stay back and do school work while their black friends go on a field trip is a pretty positive experience for everyone Administrators at a Florida middle school faced a severe backlash from parents and students after they organized a field trip only for black students.Heron Creek Middle School scheduled a trip to Black Violin, a  performance by black musicians,  WSTP reports. I think it should be the whole school not just blacks,  says black seventh-grader Richard Service.Instead, administrators were caught segregating students based on race.The school received 50 tickets and decided to give them only to black students.  They said it was for blacks to be motivated to improve their grades,  according to Service. I did think it was kind of racist that Latinos, Chinese couldn t go,  says Jennifer Bender, another student at the school. No matter what race it s wrong all the way around,  according to parent Steve Moreno.Other parents were harshly critical of the move on a community Facebook page. Linda Prince wrote:Just wanted to let the community be aware of what is happening at Heron Creek Middle School. Yesterday they called an assemble for ONLY African American students. The assembly was to tell them that they could earn a field trip for good behavior. After writing a email to the school board last night letting them know I was upset, I received a call from the vice principle this afternoon. He told me it was because there was an upcoming performance from a group called Two Black Musicians and they thought it would be a good motivational tool for their African American students. I thought segregation ended a long time ago. I completely do not agree with this. Basically I was told we just have to agree to disagree.After the backlash, administrators decided to allow all students to attend. We care about every child on this campus. We celebrate diversity all the time,  Principal Matthew Gruhl says. We didn t mean to send a negative message. We wanted to be positive,  according to Gruhl.  We learned from this,  he says, adding a bit sarcastically,  We are sorry if we hurt people s feelings. Gruhl had told students they were changing the rules not because they were caught segregating students based on race, but because,  We learned there s a demand for all our students to have an opportunity to see this great performance. They re now trying to raise $3,500 to purchase 500 tickets so more students can go, based on grades and behavior and not race. There s no word on who will go if they don t raise that amount of money. They had some parents upset this opportunity was not extended to more students,  Sarasota County schools spokesman Scott Ferguson tells the Herald-Tribune.  They decided today to open it up to all students who met the same criteria. That involves grades and behavior and other criteria.

12902,LESTER HOLT PULLS A “Candy Crowley” 5 Times…Joins Team Hillary To Help Debate Trump,"Who won the debate tonight? Donald J. Trump or the Lester Holt-Clinton team?NBC News  Lester Holt had his  Candy Crowley  moment at the first debate of the 2016 presidential election on Monday night, bowing to pressure from the Hillary Clinton campaign and the liberal media by  fact-checking  Republican nominee Donald Trump on the question of his support for the Iraq War.Holt lived up to the expectations of his peers. But he lived down to the worst expectations of conservatives, who routinely see Republican candidates treated unfairly by debate moderators.Hillary also went over the 2 minute mark several times, while there were several times when Lester Holt would cut Donald Trump off after only having a little over a minute to answer a question. Again and again, Holt asked Trump tough questions that were straight from the Clinton campaign s talking points, and which were obvious set-ups for Clinton to attack (and for fact-checkers to pounce on whatever Trump asserted in his own defense).Here are the five worst examples.Tax returns. Holt never asked Clinton about her e-mail scandal, about Benghazi, or about the Clinton Foundation and its dubious dealings. But he did ask Trump about his tax returns, arguing   not asking   that there might be questionable information in them that the American public deserved to hear.Birther conspiracy theory. Holt never asked Clinton about her past record of racist statements, including her  super-predator  remarks as First Lady, or her explicit appeal to  white Americans  in her 2008 primary campaign against Obama. Yet he asked Trump about the Birther conspiracy theory and cast it as racist.Stop-and-frisk. After an exchange between the candidates over the policy of  stop-and-frisk,  Holt interjected to bolster Clinton s point by stating, erroneously, that stop-and-frisk had ended in New York because it had been declared unconstitutional by a court. Trump countered, correctly, that the new mayor had canceled the policy before the litigation was over. A presidential look.  Towards the end of the debate, Holt asked Trump about what he meant by saying Hillary Clinton did not have  a presidential look.  He did so after noting that Clinton had become  the first woman  to be nominated for president by a major political party, thus setting Trump up as a sexist. As Trump answered, Holt interrupted him, then gave Clinton a chance to respond with her talking points about Trump s past comments on women.Iraq War. The question of whether Trump supported the Iraq War or not has been widely debated. What is beyond doubt is that Hillary Clinton voted for it. Holt only represented one side of the debate about Trump, and never asked Clinton about her own vote. Via: Breitbart",politics,"Sep 26, 2016"

18471,NO SHAME! MSNBC ANCHOR Attacks Critically Injured Steve Scalise Who Can’t Defend Himself [Video],"Joy Reid is known for her racist slant on the news. She s one bitter and angry woman we ve reported on numerous times for her over-the-top rhetoric. This latest rant is surprising even for Reid. She goes after critically injured congressman Steve Scalise with the aide of a NAACP board member. Steve Scalise cannot defend himself right now The left has no shame!Reid:  There s a whole country out there and a lot of people, at least in my Twitter timeline, and it s a delicate thing, because everybody is wishing the congressman well and hoping that he recovers, but Steve Scalise has a history that we ve all been forced to sort of ignore on race. He did come to leadership after some controversy over attending a white nationalist event, which he says he didn t know what it was. He also co-sponsored a bill to amend the Constitution to define marriage as between a man and a woman. He co-sponsored the House healthcare bill, which as you said would gut healthcare for millions of people including three million children and he cosponsored a bill to repeal the ban on semiautomatic weapons. Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise is still hospitalized in critical condition but liberal MSNBC host Joy Ann Reid didn t let that stop her from portraying Scalise as an extremist just three days after an angry left-winger shot Scalise and tried to assassinate dozens of Republican congressmen in Alexandria, Virginia on Wednesday.House Majority Whip Steve Scalise was in  imminent risk of death  when he was flown to a trauma center Wednesday after being shot during an ambush of a GOP congressional baseball team practicing on a Virginia field. He will be in the hospital for a considerable period of time, presumably weeks,  said Jack Sava, trauma director at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, who spoke Friday about the Louisiana Republican who remains in critical condition at the hospital in the District.Sava added that Scalise  was as critical as you can be when he came in  after a single rifle shot traversed his body from his left hip through internal organs to the other hip as witnesses said he was fielding ground balls.The shot fired at Scalise left perhaps hundreds of bullet fragments internally, many of which may never be removed because surgery might be more dangerous than leaving them in place, Sava said. That circumstance is not uncommon for that type of injury, known as a transpelvic gunshot wound, the trauma surgeon said.Sava said Scalise will require surgeries soon for abdominal and bone injuries, in addition to the two he has undergone to repair a bone in his leg broken by the bullet. The congressman sustained  substantial damage  to organs and blood vessels, Sava said, and remains in intensive care.How can these idiots keep arguing with a man who is critically injured in the hospital?

8008, Actor Martin Sheen Tells Senate GOP To Do Their Jobs When Obama Picks SCOTUS Nominee (AUDIO),"Martin Sheen channeled his President Jed Bartlett character from The West Wing to call upon voters to tell Senate Republicans to obey the Constitution.As conservative groups mobilize and begin spending massive amounts of money to keep Republicans to their word that they will refuse to even hold hearings on any of President Obama s Supreme Court nominees to fill the vacant seat Antonin Scalia leaves behind, People For The American Way is fighting back with a campaign of their own. The strategy is to use Sheen in a series of robocalls designed to urge voters to shame Republican senators from Wisconsin and Pennsylvania into doing their jobs.Specifically, the calls target Senator Ron Johnson in Wisconsin and Senator Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania. Our Constitution is very clear about what happens when a vacancy occurs of the Supreme Court,  Sheen says in the call. It says the President shall nominate a new judge and that the Senate will give that nominee a fair consideration. But as you may have heard, Republicans are playing politics with out Constitution and with the Supreme Court. Sheen then goes after Johnson for saying that he doesn t think Senate Republicans should even give a hearing to any nominee.  That s clearly irresponsible and it puts partisanship above the law,  Sheen says before asking voters to call Johnson and tell him to put his  constitutional duties first and give fair consideration to President Obama s nominee. Here s the audio of the Wisconsin robocall via Talking Points Memo.This isn t the first time Martin Sheen has urged voters to stand up for American values. In 2014, he appeared in an ad asking Kentucky voters to elect Alison Lundergan Grimes over Mitch McConnell so that Social Security and Medicare will continue to be safe and made stronger.As we all know, McConnell ended up winning another term in the Senate, which he is now using disgracefully to disobey the Constitution and politicize the Supreme Court instead of doing his job responsibly by holding confirmation hearings for whoever President Obama nominates to fill Scalia s seat.Hopefully, voters won t ignore Sheen s call this time around.

Fox, like anyone who has paid attention to Donald Trump during the campaign and since his ascent to the White House, knows that this presidential run wasn t about running the nation.

He likely thought he d be busy putting gold toilets in the White House, taunting Democrats, and telling big crowds of supporters how great he is.Largely, that IS what Trump is doing; after all, he held a victory tour of rallies, and held a dueling event the night of the White House Correspondents  Dinner so that he could mock the so-called  Washington elite.  And, of course, we all see his Twitter feed, which is full of mockery and ridicule.However, during all of this, we see a White House riddled with scandal after scandal of Trump s own making. The Russia investigation is heating up, and no matter how many times Trump and his supporters say it is  fake news,  it isn t going away. Even members of Trump s own Republican Party are floating the idea of impeachment. President Fox is right   Trump is getting attention, but definitely not the kind he wanted.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"May 17, 2017"
7476, Comedian Russell Brand DESTROYS Trump In Hilarious Stand-Up Routine (VIDEO),"Republican front-runner Donald Trump has caused a lot of outrage since stepping into the race for the White House, and with good reason. The billionaire is the worst person to run for the highest office since white supremacist George Wallace in 1968. But for all the anger he has caused, he s also given comedians a whole lot of material. The latest comedian to capitalize on the Trump train wreck is Russell Brand and it is hilarious.Brand has long been a champion of economic and social justice in both the United States and the U.K. The comedian often speaks out about politics and once said: I have never voted. Like most people I am utterly disenchanted by politics. Like most people I regard politicians as frauds and liars and the current political system as nothing more than a bureaucratic means for furthering the augmentation and advantages of economic elites. Although, I don t agree with him not taking advantage of his right to vote in the U.K., I do agree that lots of people have become disenchanted with politics. Actually, part of the reason Donald Trump has risen to the top of the GOP race is because he isn t part of the  establishment  and his imbecilic fan club believes he is honest   but, I digress.Brand has a successful v-blog called The Trew News which has unfortunately been on hiatus for the last six months. However, on Tuesday, the comedian surprised us all by posting a short new video online where he absolutely pummels Trump. In the video titled  Trump   Pixar-Hitler or aged-baby?  Brand says: I like him cause he s like a big rich baby. I just want to breastfeed him. Come here you silly c*nt, have a bit of t*t-milk. He is like a giant, rich baby and he proves it every time he lashes out at people who do not give him what he wants. He d be a disaster for this country and everyone knows it, even comedians from other countries. We are a laughingstock all over the world thanks to him and all the dumbasses who support him.Watch the rest of Brand s remarks in his video: Featured image via Instagram",News,"March 15, 2016"

21678,HILLARY COULDN’T FIND 125 WOMEN TO BUY TICKETS TO ‘Women Only’ FUNDRAISER…Forced To Sell Tickets To Men,"But what about Hillary being a  formidable opponent  when it comes to women voters? Hillary Clinton had trouble attracting high-powered women to a New York talk hosted by Silda Wall Spitzer two weeks before her campaign officially kicks off. Sources said that after ticket sales fizzled for an intimate, $2,700-per-person,  just for women  meeting on Monday, the event was thrown open to men at the 11th hour, and the deadline extended to buy tickets.The  Conversation With Hillary Clinton  event at Midtown law firm Akin Gump was originally aiming to attract 125 women. An email invitation seen by Page Six said the event is  just for women.  But by Friday,  They d only sold 50 tickets, so they threw it open to men,  a source said.  Ticket sales were supposed to close at 10 a.m. Sunday, but the hostesses were working the phones and pushed the deadline till Monday. We hear about 90 attendees included former Bill Clinton aide Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney and his husband, Randy Florke, Maurice Tempelsman, Jill Braufman (wife of hedge funder Daniel Nir), Jean Shafiroff and Susan Cole. The event began at noon, but Clinton arrived at 1 p.m. in  a royal blue jacket and black pants.  She then took pictures with donors and delivered a half-hour speech before leaving at about 2 p.m.Silda introduced Clinton as a  tough, authentic leader,  which is probably more than she can say about her hard-charging ex Eliot. In a possible nod to her host, Clinton quoted Eleanor Roosevelt, quipping,  Every woman in public life needs to develop skin as tough as rhinoceros hide. Topics included  clean energy,  mental health care for college kids, keeping but  revising  ObamaCare, Vladimir Putin, and America s heroin and meth  epidemic. Meanwhile, on Monday, journalists covering Clinton met in Washington, DC, to grouse about inadequate access to the candidate. When we reached out to a local Clinton campaign rep who helped organize the event, she referred us to Clinton s deputy national press secretary, who referred us to her  rapid response spokesperson,  who, not surprisingly, had no comment.Via: NY Post",left-news,"Jun 2, 2015"
8441, Hillary Clinton Did Not Send ‘Top Secret’ Emails On Private Server,"On January 29, the U.S. State Department announced that the agency had identified 37 pages of  top secret emails  among the 55,000 pages of emails contained on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s private email server.Not surprisingly, Clinton s GOP rivals went straight to work spreading half-truths and misinformation about the announcement.As former Chair of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee Dianne Feinstein pointed out in a statement on Friday, several key facts are being left out of the narrative surrounding the announcement.For starters, the 37 pages of  top secret  communication actually involve only seven chain emails. Each of these seven emails was sent to a larger group of recipients, including the former Secretary of State.None of the  top secret emails  were sent from Hillary Clinton s private server.All of the emails originated from within the State Department s unclassified system. None of them contained the mandatory  top secret  label which is required for all classified communication.During a press conference on Friday, State Dept. spokesperson John Kirby told reporters that the emails were being withheld because they meet the definition of top secret communication now.Kirby also stressed that the emails were not marked classified at the time that they were sent. Was the information contained in the emails considered classified at the time they were sent? Keep in mind that all 55,000 of Clinton s emails were sent between March 2009 and February 2013. Since the State Department regularly raises the status of unclassified material to the level of classified, it s more than likely the content of these seven emails was not considered classified when it was sent.According to Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon,  in at least one case, the emails appear to involve information from a published news article. The last time the GOP went wild with claims that Clinton had  top secret emails  on her private server, we later found out that the information had been retroactively classified by the FBI.To summarize:In other words, this is not the huge scandal republicans were hoping for. Instead, it s just another baseless right wing attack on Hillary Clinton that falls apart under even the slightest amount of scrutiny.Featured image credit: Pixabay",News,"January 30, 2016"
16668,OBAMA UNDERMINES AMERICA…Plans To Slash Nuclear Stockpiles…Again,"Dinesh D Sousa warned us about Obama s reduction of our nation s nuclear stockpile in his movie,  2016, Obama s America.  Shortly after his blockbuster movie appeared in theaters across America, Dinesh D Souza was charged with violating federal campaign finance laws and was sentenced to five years of probation, a $30,000 fine, and eight months in a San Diego  community confinement center  where he was forced to undergo  therapeutic counseling. Here is what Dinesh D Souza predicted:Driven by the alleged anti-colonialist ideology of a father he barely met, President Barack Obama systematically is undermining America economically and militarily   leaving it vulnerable to financial collapse, and even as unlikely as the possibility may seem, nuclear attack.And it charges as he slashes the defense budget, Obama is simultaneously pushing to reduce the nation s nuclear stockpile to as low as a few hundred missiles   even as other countries like China, Russia and North Korea are modernizing and expanding their arsenals, and Iran   widely believed to be close to developing nuclear weapons   is threatening to annihilate Israel.   From Dinesh D Sousa s controversial 2010 book,  The Roots Of Obama s Rage   WNDHere is what is actually happening today:The United States cut its nuclear stockpiles by 20 percent between 1996 and 2013, with more reductions likely to come, according to recently declassified information released by the White House.Stockpiles of highly enriched uranium, or HEU, which is used to fuel a nuclear weapon, were cut from 740.7 metric tons to 586.6 metric tons from 1996 to 2013, according to recently declassified information made available by the Obama administration. This reflects a reduction of over 20 percent,  the White House announced.  Moreover, further reductions in the inventory are ongoing; the U.S. Department of Energy s material disposition program has down-blended 7.1 metric tons of HEU since September 30, 2013, and continues to make progress in this area. The stockpile reductions are part of an effort by the Obama administration to eliminate nuclear materials and move away from these types of weapons.The move comes as countries such as Russia and North Korea move to increase their nuclear stockpiles. Russia, for instance, has made several announcements about its intent to boost its nuclear stockpile and number of weapons.However, the United States is moving in the opposite direction.Via:WFB ",Government News,"Apr 4, 2016"

4282," Hillary Just Responded To Trump’s Pre-Debate Bullsh*t On Twitter, And It’s EPIC (TWEET)","After the release of the videotape showing Trump not only use derogatory language about women, but also profess to be a sexual predator, we re starting to notice the Trump campaign in a bit of tailspin.Trump s getting so desperate, in fact, that he just dragged out some women who allege they re victims of sexual abuse from Bill Clinton. What people need to remember is that, no matter if any of those allegations are true, Bill is not who is running for president. Trump is acting out of fear because he knows he s about to have his orange ass handed to him.Hillary s Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri released the official statement from the Clinton campaign regarding Trump s desperation:The statement read: We re not surprised to see Donald Trump continue his destructive race to the bottom. Hillary Clinton understands the opportunity in this town hall is to talk to voters on stage and in the audience about the issues that matter to them, and this stunt doesn t change that. If Donald Trump doesn t see that, that s his loss. As always, she s prepared to handle whatever Donald Trump throws her way.

6418, Here’s Why 2016 Will Be The Year Of The Woman,"Go back to 1991. Anita Hill accuses Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment just as his confirmation hearings are wrapping up. Republicans, still sour about the failed nomination of Robert Bork, decide to turn the confirmation into a media circus in an attempt to smear Hill and save their ultra-conservative zealot from being held accountable for his actions.Women in America were disgusted with what they saw   old, Republican men turning their backs on a respected women who was sexually harassed and instead blindly taking the word of their ideologue for purely partisan reasons.It was this repulsive circus show that led to the 1992 election, which was dubbed the Year of the Woman. In that very important election, as not only was President Bill Clinton elected over George H.W. Bush (who appointed Thomas), but some of the most influential women of the Senate were elected   Barbara Boxer of California, Patty Murray of Washington, and Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois.According to the House s record:In 1992, women went to the polls, energized by a record-breaking number of women on the federal ticket. The results were unprecedented; the 24 women who won election to the U.S. House of Representatives for the first time that November comprised the largest number elected to the House in any single election, and the women elected to the Senate tripled the number of women in that chamber.Women had one simple message for the GOP: they were sick and tired of sexist, old Republican men.And that is why 2016 will be the Year of the Woman. With Donald Trump as the clear cut nominee for President of the United States, there is no doubt women will come out in full force   with a clear hatred for him and his rhetoric   and send liberal women to Washington in droves.Look at the facts:According to a CNN poll from April 2016, a whopping 73 percent of women have a highly unfavorable view of Donald Trump, and it only continues to grow. Almost 40 percent of Republican women have an unfavorable view of the frontrunner. He s now the nominee for the Republican Party. The man who has referred to women as  bitches  and  dogs  is now the de facto leader of a major American political party.There are a historical amount of strong and competitive women running for the Senate this election season:Republicans fear that the Trump nomination could cost them the Senate. And with women as the Democratic nominees for many of the most competitive races this season, things are looking good for another Year of the Woman.If Democrats vote down ticket (which thy usually do in presidential elections), Democrats take back the Senate with the help of eight qualified ladies.With dozens of House races being ran by progressive women, Congress could and will look vastly different   of Democrats want it to be. All they have to do is vote. They just have to get out and vote.And with Hillary Clinton inching her way to the presidential nomination, it looks as though women will have more control than ever before, and that s absolutely a good thing.Women have one of strongest voices in the American electorate. In 1992, they were pissed and rightfully so. In 2016, the sentiments are the exact same. Nancy Pelosi and Elizabeth Warren are taking Donald Trump to task everyday for his sexist, dangerous rhetoric. Women are fired up, and they won t be quiet or sit this one out.I want women to decide this election.

Of course, he s going anyhow. It is of no consequence to him that basically the whole town wants him to stay away. Keep it classy Barry Maybe the Roseberg residents should make the same kind of human chain between Barack and the cameras that they do around the Westboro Baptist  Church  members at funerals Roseberg residents and even relatives of victims are telling Barack Obama to stay home and don t come here to dance on the graves of our loved ones.

Now Stacy Boylan, the father of shooting victim Ana Boylan, is directly speaking out against Obama s visit and has no interest in putting up with his exploitation of the tragedy for political purposes. I do believe it was Rahm Emanuel who said  Never let a good tragedy go to waste,  and I really feel that his [Obama] visit here is to completely to support his gun control agenda. I can t understand why he wouldn t make a mention of the families and the victims. I mean, he did say that it was a tragic incident and I do thank him for lowering the flags but he made it all about gun control. He was very clear about that and we saw this in Sandy Hook and now we re seeing it again and I just question his motives,  Boylan said.  I ve spoken to my family and for myself and for my family, my daughter and son, on principle I find that we are in disagreement with his policies on gun control and therefore we will not be attending the visit. My position on this is that gun free zones are an issue, they re a target for crazy people because they know they re not going to be met with resistance. You know, my daughter said to me,  What if somebody would have had a gun?  Gun free and gun control takes that option off the table. Somebody doesn t have to use their gun in defense, but to take that option entirely, I don t think that s the right course,  he continued. Via: Townhall On Monday, David Jacques, publisher of the Roseburg Beacon, appeared on a Fox News segment with Bill O Reilly.He made it clear President Obama was not welcome in Roseburg and certainly not to crash the funerals of those killed in the Umpqua Community College mass shooting by using it for his own liberal agenda.https://youtu.be/F-fS9SBLTGkVia: Downtrend",politics,"Oct 7, 2015"

Brophy suggested that the State Department could move things along in Congress.The only problem was, Brophy was representing a country she wasn t registered to represent.Foreign Agent Registration Act rules require individual lobbyists to register the clients they represent, and lobbying firms are required to file their contacts on behalf of those clients.Brophy is a former Clinton White House official, and has raised money for Ready for Hillary, a pro-Clinton super PAC that shut down when the former secretary of state announced her presidential campaign. The Clintons attended her wedding to lawyer and diplomat Gerald McGowan in 1998.The speech by then-president Lee Myung-bak did proceed and took place on Oct. 13, 2011.Joel Johnson, a managing director for Glover Park Group, told BuzzFeed News that Brophy had in fact been on the team working on the South Korean account and that she should have been listed as doing so in their FARA documents. She absolutely was working on the account and had been throughout, and the fact that she had somehow not been listed directly as the principal working on the account was an administrative error,  Johnson said.Johnson also said that Brophy  should have reported that that contact had been made to the State Department and for whatever reason that was not included in our list of activities and it should have been, and I ll go back and make sure we do whatever is appropriate to amend that. Blah blah blah Is anyone else sick and tired of the Clinton s and anyone attached to the Clinton s not having to follow the same rules and laws the rest of America is expected to follow, or face the consequences of our actions?

3711, WATCH: Texas Judge Orders Newly Sworn-In Citizens To Accept Trump Or Leave The Country,"Demanding allegiance to a head of state as a condition for becoming a citizen sounds like something a dictator would do.And that s exactly what a Texas judge did during a swearing-in ceremony for immigrants who have been waiting to become citizens of the United States.John Primono is a federal judge who has sworn in over 100,000 new citizens during his career. But the election of Donald trump has apparently emboldened him to violate all sense of judicial ethics and human decency to warn new citizens that they better accept Trump as their president or else. I can assure you that whether you voted for him or you did not vote for him, if you are a citizen of the United States, he is your president,  Primono told the new citizens as they were forced to listen.  He will be your president, and if you do not like that, you need to go to another country. Here s the video via KENS.This is a pretty damn disgraceful thing to say to a group of people who clearly want to be Americans, especially from a federal judge.And Primono is paying the price for his partisanship because he was removed from presiding over any future citizenship ceremonies by the U.S. District judges.Of course, conservatives are very pleased and have made Primono their new hero, which alone should force him off the bench because it is clear that he is unable to exercise good judgement and political neutrality.But Primono claimed that he was merely offering a message of  unity  and that his remarks were taken out of context. I would never say anything like that,  Primono told KENS.  I wasn t trying to say anything for or against Donald Trump. I was just trying to say something hopeful and unifying, and unfortunately it was taken out of context. Yeah, that s complete bullshit. Telling new American citizens to support Trump or else is not  unifying.  It s a threatening message designed to scare immigrants into blindly following Trump.Immigrants should not have to deal with such threats in this country, where we have the right to political dissent. And the way Trump has treated immigrants over the last year and half makes it clear that he doesn t respect them. He hates them. So it s understandable that immigrants would be opposed to Trump s presidency. But they are not alone. Americans overwhelmingly voted against Donald Trump but he somehow won via the electoral vote. Millions of Americans are protesting against Trump and his bigotry.On a day when this group of diverse people finally became American citizens, this federal judge marred the ceremony by invoking the name of a divisive hatemonger and literally ordered them to accept Trump as their leader. It should never have happened but it makes one wonder how many more judges are going to become emboldened to behave similarly once Trump takes over in January.Featured image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"November 22, 2016"

19545,DID HILLARY Just Lose Her “Get Out Of Jail Free” Card?…Senior Trump Advisor: “Trump Has Not Ruled Out Criminal Probe” Against Hillary,"A senior Donald Trump adviser is calling Hillary Clinton s decision to join a recount effort  incredible  and noting that the president-elect has not ruled out pursuing a criminal investigation into his former Democratic rival.Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told CNN s  State of the Nation  that Trump has not ruled out a criminal probe into Clinton s use of a private email server as secretary of state, even though Trump recently indicated he d rather not do so.Conway said,  He s been incredibly gracious and magnanimous to Secretary Clinton at a time when, for whatever reason, her folks are saying they will join in a recount to try to somehow undo the 70-plus electoral votes that he beat her by. She added,  The idea that we are going to drag this out now where the president-elect has been incredibly magnanimous to the Clintons and to the Obamas is pretty incredible. Trump took to Twitter Sunday morning to condemn the Green-Party backed recount effort as  a scam.  Clinton s team joined the effort in Wisconsin after Green Party nominee Jill Stein filed paperwork formally requesting a recount.  AP",left-news,"Nov 27, 2016"
13758,ESPIONAGE ACT VIOLATION? HILLARY EXPOSES Names Of Hidden Intelligence Officials In Emails Through “Gross Negligence”,"America keeps waiting for word that Hillary will be indicted. Is Obama waiting for the right moment or will the FBI be allowed to do their job and put Hillary behind bars? Are Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren standing by in the wings? One thing we know for sure, with this corrupt administration, anything could happen. Obama seems to have mastered the art of punishing America. Will the most corrupt President to ever occupy our White House, be the one responsible for finally putting end to the Clinton Crime Syndicate or does she know too much?Hillary Clinton posted and shared the names of concealed U.S. intelligence officials on her unprotected email system. Federal records reveal that Clinton swapped these highly classified names on an email account that was vulnerable to attack and was breached repeatedly by Russia-linked hacker attempts. These new revelations   reminiscent of the Valerie Plame scandal during George W. Bush s tenure   could give FBI investigators the evidence they need to make a case that Clinton violated the Espionage Act by mishandling national defense information through  gross negligence. Numerous names cited in Clinton s emails have been redacted in State Department email releases with the classification code  B3 CIA PERS/ORG,  a highly specialized classification that means the information, if released, would violate the Central Intelligence Act of 1949.The State Department produced a document to Judicial Watch in April 2014 that identifies different types of  (b)(3)  redactions, including  CIA PERS/ORG,  which it defines as information  Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute   Central Intelligence Act of 1949. That s what it suggests,  Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton told Breitbart News, referring to the indication that Clinton disclosed the names of CIA-protected intelligence sources, based on the B3 redactions.The CIA justifies  (b)(3)  redactions with this description:  (b)(3) Applies to the Director s statutory obligations to protect from disclosure intelligence sources and methods, as well as the organization, functions, names, official titles, salaries, or numbers of personnel employed by the Agency, in accord with the National Security Act of 1947 and the CIA Act of 1949, respectively. The State Department declined to comment.  Per the colleague who handles this issue, we are not speaking to the content of emails,  State Department spokeswoman Nicole Thompson told Breitbart News.Here are some examples of (b)(3) redactions;Naming the defense attach  in MaltaOn October 16, 2011, recent U.S. Ambassador to Malta Douglas Kmiec sent an email to Cheryl Mills with the subject line  TIME SENSITIVE AND CONFIDENTIAL   Malta Trip Backgrounder for the Secretary   Confidential. Kmiec wrote to Mills,  I know from current events that your life must be a whirlwind. I know that if there ever was someone who could tame the whirlwind, it would be you. Just read the news report of the Secretary s stop in Malta next week. Thank you for arranging this. This letter and the accompanying clips I believe will help make the Secretary s visit a highly successful and well received one. In the memo, Kmiec revealed the name of a top defense attach  in the country. That name was later classified by the State Department with three different classifications: 1.4 (D) to connote  Foreign relations or foreign activities of the US, including confidential sources,  B1 to connote  Information specifically authorized by an executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy,  and  B3 CIA PERS/ORG. The largest part of our US team in the embassy is the navy/coast guard/ ncis contingent that has established a Maritime training program with the AFM to good success. The defense attach  there now is new [REDACTED] beloved and hardworking   and to good effect, patrolling the waters and the ports for [illegible] traffickers and terror related figures,  Kmiec wrote.Mills forwarded the memo directly to Clinton s private email account at clintonemail.com with the note  Fyi background. Clinton replied to Mills and CC ed Huma Abedin with the confidential information, writing,  I need enough time there to meet. Hague is there today and doing all the right meetings. So, I m copying Huma to reinforce my desire to squeeze more out of a too quick trip. When he sent the memo to Mills, Douglas Kmiec had been out of his Ambassador to Malta job for several months. Kmiec was a big supporter of President Obama. He garnered criticism in a 2011 inspector general report for ignoring directives from Washington and for spending too much time writing articles about religion. Iran Insights On September 2, 2009, Jackie Newmyer of Long Term Strategy Group in Cambridge, Massachusetts sent an email directly to Clinton s private account with the subject line  Iran Insights From [Redacted]  that included the B3 redaction code:Secretary Clinton,Last week I traveled to Israel [REDACTED] in an Iran-related seminar and simulation exercise with the IDF general who is likely to become Israel s next chief of military intelligence and his team and, separately, [REDACTED]. Yesterday, [REDACTED] Iran workshop in Washington involving DoD and think tank experts. Despite the fact that the meetings were with defense [REDACTED] personnel, there was universal sentiment that a strike on Iran s nuclear facilities would be counterproductive, on the one hand, and that incremental measures would be perceived by Iran as an indication of weakness, on the other.The email included sensitive information including the following:If Iran acquires a nuclear capability, no single American/allied countermeasure will be adequate. Something like the  flexible response  posture from the Cold War will be required, necessitating a range of actions from enhancing the US deterrent presence   nuclear submarines carrying ballistic missiles in the Arabian Sea   to bolstering regional actors  defenses.Israeli leaders should be able to contain the damage to the Israeli population s morale from an Iranian bomb, but this will require careful management of public statements. There is a tension between building up support for action against the Iranian nuclear program now and delivering the kind of reassurance that will be necessary once the capability has been acquired.Clinton replied that she would like to discuss the matter with Jackie.Jackie replied:I will be in Washington for a day-long meeting on Thursday this week [B3 REDACTED] and my travel plans are flexible, so I could meet you any time on Wednesday afternoon, after 5 pm on Thursday, or any time on Friday morning. If those times do not work, I would be happy to come down at your convenience.Clinton and Jake Sullivan then set up a meeting with Jackie.For entire story: Breitbart News ",politics,"Jun 5, 2016"
5459, One Person On Hillary’s Shortlist For VP Was Just Removed From DNC Speaker Schedule,"It you re into puzzles and figuring stuff out, you ve been loving the past few weeks trying to figure out who the vice presidential picks for either major party will be. Now that we know Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is Donald Trump s pick, we re now left to sift through clues to figure out who Hillary Clinton will give the nod too.Well, one huge clue was given when Elizabeth Warren showed up at Hillary Clinton s Washington D.C. home today, but an ever bigger clue has come as Warren s name appears to no longer be on the speaking schedule for the Democratic National Convention.Originally slotted to speak as the keynote speaker on Monday night of the convention, Warren s name is now missing.According to Politico, this is the schedule as it stands now:Monday:  First Lady Michelle Obama, Senator Bernie Sanders and DREAMer Astrid Silva Gavel time expected at 3:00 p.m.Tuesday:  President Bill Clinton Gavel time expected at 4:00 p.m.Also scheduled Tuesday are Mothers of the Movement members Gwen Carr, Mother of Eric Garner; Sybrina Fulton, Mother of Trayvon Martin; Maria Hamilton, Mother of Dontr  Hamilton; Lucia McBath, Mother of Jordan Davis; Lezley McSpadden, Mother of Michael Brown; Cleopatra Pendleton-Cowley, Mother of Hadiya Pendleton; Geneva Reed-Veal, Mother of Sandra Bland.Wednesday:  President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden Gavel time expected at 4:30 p.m.Thursday:  Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton Gavel time expected at 4:30 p.m.Very interesting indeed.Noticeably also missing are other members on Clinton s shortlist for vice president, such as Sherrod Brown and Tim Kaine, but seeing as Warren was scheduled to speak, and now isn t, it could be very, very telling.Now that Trump has rounded out his ticket with Mike Pence, a man who represents the only group Trump has yet to openly hate   the LGBT community   it s looking pretty good for Clinton come November, and hopefully whoever she picks as her VP will round out the ticket nicely.Featured image via Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images",News,"July 15, 2016"

7305," Exclusive: Interview With Progressive Superstar Running For Congress, Zephyr Teachout","Before Senator Bernie Sanders popularized stepping up to the Democratic establishment, which has been overrun by corporate and big money influences, Zephyr Teachout made waves in New York State by challenging Democratic incumbent, Governor Andrew Cuomo, to a primary race in 2014. Despite being heavily out funded by Governor Cuomo, who received millions of dollars in campaign contributions from corporations and wealthy interests, Ms. Teachout received 34 percent of the vote, including winning many counties in the state, including Albany County, home of the state s capital. Although she lost, her campaign, the first she ever ran, was a blow to the myth that elected officials, particularly incumbents, are invincible in elections from their own political party.In January 2016, Ms. Teachout, currently as Associate Law Professor at Fordham University, announced she is running for New York s 19th Congressional District seat. I m running to raise up the voice that people have been shut out of politics. I think you can see across the political spectrum people are really frustrated by congress, and by politics that are increasingly driven by big money,  said Ms. Teachout in a phone interview.Ms. Teachout cited as one of the broad issues she plans to tackle in congress, is campaign finance reform, especially in regards to overturning the SCOTUS Citizens United ruling in 2010. I ve already been working in the last several years to promote Congressman John Sarbanes  (D-MD) bill, which is basically modeled off of the public financing system in New York City,  she said.  Congress unfortunately is trapped by congress members having to spend 50 percent of their time raising money. A public financing system like what Congressman Sarbanes has proposed, The Government by The People Act, would allow congress members to raise money from small donors and still have enough to reach all the voters. I think shutting down the revolving door between lobbyists and government is essential. In tandem to the issue of campaign financing being overhauled by corporations, the Trans-Pacific Partnership has received a lot of criticism from Republicans, Independents, and Democrats, including Ms. Teachout, for heavily favoring corporations and handing to them unprecedented leverage over governments. The TPP is a continuation of NAFTA ad even worse than NAFTA,  said Ms. Teachout.  Instead of changing direction and building towards a 21st century trade policy, the TPP doubles down on failed trade policy. Negotiations over Trans-Pacific Partnership between the United States and 11 other countries began during the Bush administration, and has been pushed by the Obama administration. Both Democratic Presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton, and Bernie Sanders have opposed the agreement, while Republican Presidential Candidates have expressed mixed feelings over it, with Donald Trump and Ted Cruz against it, but Governor Kasich in favor. Ms. Teachout added: I m actually quite hopeful we are going to stop it. I think a year ago you would have said  the big guns have this locked down , but there has been a truly extraordinary swelling of grassroots energy from Republicans, Democrats, and Independents all across the board against it. People are saying this is the wrong direction, we actually want more made in America, we want to buy locally owned goods and we want to be making law through a democratic process. One of the real problems of the TPP for me is it shuts you out of the process, and that is fundamental. Instead of making policy through congress which has its own problems, its making policy in the backroom, and that s no way to make international or basic economic policy in our country. New York s 19th Congressional District includes Sullivan, Ulster, Delaware, Otsego, Schoharie, Greene and Columbia Counties and parts of Montgomery, Rensselaer and Dutchess Counties. Current Representative of the district, Republican Chris Gibson announced he is retiring, leaving the seat wide open. Ms. Teachout is currently a favorite to win, she won almost every county in the district against Governor Cuomo in 2014. In the Democratic Primaries, she faces challenges from John Kehoe, a 29-year-old self-described moderate Democrat who runs a recording studio in the Hudson Valley, and Will Yandik, a town councilman from Columbia County, though popular consensus in the district s local Democratic Parties favor Ms. Teachout, according to the Poughkeepsie Journal.The Democratic Primaries take place on June 28th, 2016. On the Republican side, it will be a toss-up mainly between Andrew Heaney, a small businessman and graduate from Harvard Business School, and John Faso, a former New York State Assemblyman. Mr. Faso, who has hired Bill O Reilly as a communications consultant, has criticized Heaney for donating to President Obama s 2008 campaign. Mr. Heaney has also been accused of illegally coordinating with a Super-Pac he created, the New York Jobs Council.As progressivism has made its mark on the 2016 presidential election from the popularity of Senator Bernie Sanders  campaign, it has inspired progressive candidates across the country to run for office on similar platforms. Ms. Teachout s advice for those progressive candidates who are standing up to make their mark in a primary against an establishment backed candidate, as she did in 2014 against Governor Andrew Cuomo; spend as much time as you can on the ground listening to people, not in a closed room listening to donors. There s an extraordinary strength in the deep American grassroots and it s pretty exciting to see what could happen if you put a lot more trust in people.

21637,[VIDEO] DOES SEEING TWO NAKED LESBIANS IN BED TOGETHER MAKE YOU WANT TO EAT YOGURT? Chobani Apparently Thinks It Does,"It s a shame really when a company who produces a really great product is more driven by their desire to promote a perverted social message than to actually promote their product. My husband thanks you Chobani, because of your decision to shove your brand of  diversity  down our throats, he ll have 20 less cartons of Chobani yogurt to shift around in our refrigerator every week. Greek yogurt brand Chobani debuted the latest television spot for its Simply 100 yogurt on Monday, with a surprise twist at the end in the closing seconds of the ad, the couple eating yogurt in bed are revealed to be lesbians.Created by ad agency Opperman Weiss, the 30-second spot, part of the brand s new seven-part  Love This Life  campaign, features a naked woman eating Chobani yogurt in bed next to her partner. The woman leans over and tickles her partner s foot, then seductively slides off the bed as the brand s new slogan appears onscreen.Chobani CMO Peter McGuiness told ad industry magazine AdWeek that using a lesbian couple in the spot was a  natural progression  for the new campaign. The campaign hopes to highlight a  series of modern American stories that connect the brand s values to its fans  values. For us, it s why not [feature a same-sex couple]   not why,  McGuiness told AdWeek.  There s nothing new here, per say. Inclusion and equality has been and is foundational and fundamental to the company. Chobani is the latest brand to include same-sex couples in its advertising. In January, luxury jewelry outlet Tiffany & Co. introduced its first-ever spot featuring a gay couple getting engaged. Other brands featuring same-sex couples in its ads include Wells Fargo and clothing retailer Gap.Television advertising represents something of a new frontier for the LGBT movement. Of course, television itself has exploded with critically-acclaimed programming featuring gay and transgender characters.Bruce Jenner, who came out as a woman last month on a now-infamous Vanity Fair magazine cover, is set to star in I Am Cait, a new eight-part docu-series about living as a transgender woman premiering this summer on the E! network. Fourteen-year-old transgender high-schooler Jazz Jennings will also get her own reality show, All That Jazz, on TLC this summer. Those shows are just the first in an expected bump in transgender-themed reality television programming.Transgender actor Laverne Cox earned an Emmy nomination for the Netflix prison series Orange is the New Black, while Jeffrey Tambor picked up a Golden Globe for his role as transitioning father Maura Pfefferman in Amazon s Transparent, which itself won Best Television Series honors at this year s Globes.Over on network television, Jussie Smollet portrays Jamal Lyon, the gay son of a hip-hop mogul on Empire, the biggest show on TV last season. And in March, ABC Family s The Fosters made history by airing the youngest-ever same-sex kiss between two 13-year-old boys.Via: Breitbart NewsBelow, you will find the message I sent to Chobani. Please feel free to send your own message to this address: www.care.chobani.comHave you lost your mind? What were you thinking when you produced a commercial for your high quality yogurt featuring two naked lesbian women in bed? I have a few large social media sites, and as I sit writing about your choice to place your social messaging above your product, I realize that the 20-25 cartons of Chobani I buy for myself and my three athletic daughters will be the last Chobani yogurt I buy. When my girls ask me  why?  I will have to explain to them that you have chosen to push a minority lifestyle on everyday Americans with no regard for how it may affect the young children and traditional families who purchase your product. I have nothing against gay relationships, I do however, have something against a company who I have been so loyal to for so long, choosing to push a lifestyle on America that we simply don t want pushed on us. My husband will be happy, as he ll have more room in the fridge to keep his beer cold, because I will now be buying the large containers of Fage yogurt and adding my own fruit. So long Chobani! I hope your message was worth the backlash you will certainly receive. You ve pushed the envelope too far this time Here is their emailed response(inlcuding the name of the respondent as well as his phone number: Hey, Patty.Thank you for sharing your thoughts with us about our newest  Love This Life  commercial.We launched our  Love This Life  campaign in May to reflect our fans and celebrate the role that natural food plays in their lives.As part of our founding mission to make better food for more people, inclusiveness is at the heart of our company.

4563, Chelsea Handler Gets The Last Word After RNC Chair Attacks Hillary For Not Smiling (VIDEO),"There may be a few women out there who enjoy a man telling them to be more joyous in their presence, but as for the rest of us, there s nothing a woman hates more than being told to smile.Do men smile all the time? No. Because if they did, we d think they were crazy and up to something. Same goes for women.Not every situation calls for a smile at all times. Especially when discussing foreign policy and our military. So, when RNC Chair Reince Priebus thought it appropriate to criticize Hillary Clinton for not smiling enough during the NBC forum hosted by Matt Lauer, it didn t exactly go over well.One person who definitely had a lot to say about Priebus and his request of a smile from Hillary was none other than Chelsea Handler on her hit Netflix show Chelsea.Chelsea began by asking Priebus: Who the f*ck are you to tell someone to smile? Adding: This is just another example of how men feel the can belittle every woman in the world and order up a smile. Chelsea then said: Stop telling women to smile. We don t like that. It s not an icebreaker, it s a deal breaker. Going for Priebus  jugular, Chelsea absolutely destroys him and his ridiculously corny smile, then says: You know when women will smile?

22834,Pay Off: The Establishment Rewards Comey with $2 million Book Deal,"21st Century Wire says For his role in helping to sow chaos in the US political system and for promulgating the official conspiracy theory that Russia somehow  hacked  the US electoral process helping Donald Trump to win last November, and also ensuring that no charges were brought anywhere near the Clintons   former FBI Director James Comey has just received the first of many gifts from the Establishment.James Comey is no stranger to elite circles, and is clearly regarded by those at the top as  a safe pair of hands. As 21WIRE reported last year, James Comey served on the board of banking giant HSBC   the same bank that was convicted of international drugs and terrorism money laundering, as well as a bank which was closely linked to the corrupt Clinton Foundation. After working fellow lawyers Eric Holder and Lorretta Lynch to stage manage the public fall out from revelations about HSBC s epic criminal enterprise, and their subsequent slap on the wrist, Comey was then rewarded by President Obama when he was appointed head of the FBI in 2013.By anyone s measure, Comey was central to the mess which has resulted from the political circus surrounding the establishment s efforts to derail the Trump campaign, and  now through the Trump presidency.Congratulations. You got your book deal. You ve made it James AP/The GuardianThe former FBI director James Comey has signed a $2m ( 1.5m) deal for a book about leadership and decision-making that will draw on his career in government, which included the high-profile drama leading up to his sacking from Donald Trump s administration.According to the publisher, Comey will tell how he handled the bureau s probe into Hillary Clinton s private email server and the allegations of ties between Russia and Trump s presidential campaign.Trump sacked Comey as FBI chief in May, later telling NBC News that he was angered by the FBI s investigation into  this Russia thing , which he insists is a fake story. Comey has since testified before Congress that Trump asked him to end an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael T Flynn and kept memos about his meetings with the president.The book was acquired by Flatiron, an Macmillan imprint, which promises that Comey will cite  examples from some of the highest-stakes situations in the past two decades of US government . It will also  share yet unheard anecdotes from his long and distinguished career .The book is currently untitled and scheduled for publication next spring. Throughout his career, James Comey has had to face one difficult decision after another, as he has served the leaders of our country,  Flatiron said in a statement.  His book promises to take us inside those extraordinary moments in our history, showing us how these leaders have behaved under pressure. By doing so, Director Comey will give us unprecedented entry into the corridors of power, and a remarkable lesson in leadership itself.

3047, Senate Democrats FORCE GOP To Reveal How They’ll F*CK Americans Over During Midnight Vote,"It seems that in some ways at least, Congress doesn t quite know what to do with itself now that they ve got control of absolutely everything at the federal level. Senate Democrats seem to know that and have been using it to force Republicans to vote for things they might not otherwise vote for out of fear of pissing off their constituents.Last night, and into this morning, in fact, the Democrats of the Senate forced the GOP s hand on healthcare. No, they didn t force Republicans to admit they want to destroy Obamacare   we already know that. They engaged in a  vote-a-rama  of sorts to force Republicans to vote to gut things that their constituents will hate. They forced Republicans to admit that they re perfectly fine gutting Medicare, Medicaid, mental healthcare, women s healthcare, and more.How did they do it? They engaged in a  vote-a-rama,  in which they presented a series of amendments to a budget resolution intended to allow Congress to repeal Obamacare with simple majorities in both houses.Every one of those amendments failed. Quelle surprise, though.Several Democrats in the Senate made a point of voicing their objections as they cast their  no  votes on the budget resolution measure. For instance, Sen. Claire McCaskill (R-Missouri) said,  Because there is no replace, I vote no. The vote-a-rama lasted nearly seven hours, and included not only Democratic amendments to protect Medicare and Medicaid, but also, late Wednesday evening, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: Put this irresponsible and rushed repeal plan aside. Work with us Democrats on a way to improve health care in America, not put chaos in place of affordable care. Mitch McConnell, however, had his own statement to issue when the vote was complete: The Senate just took an important step toward repealing and replacing Obamacare by passing the resolution that provides the legislative tools necessary to actually repeal this failed law while we move ahead with smarter health care policies. Republicans have never actually been able to point to anything that proves the ACA (which, yes, is Obamacare) is a failed policy. Does it have problems? Yes. Name one thing that doesn t, though, especially a program this complex that s only in its fledgling years.But repealing Obamacare means so much more than just ending a so-called  failed  law. It means harming millions of people in pursuit of a political goal   one that their constituents don t believe will hurt them because they literally think that Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act are two different things.Republicans don t care about collateral damage, though. They got their repeal measure through over and above the efforts of Democrats to stop it. But stopping it wasn t the Democrats  only objective. They seemed to know that, if they couldn t stop this, they could either embarrass Republicans with their votes, or force them to admit to things they don t want to admit to.Photo of Chuck Schumer by Win McNamee/Getty Images.

Indeed, upon hearing the news, many are no doubt jumping out of their seats yelling,  we told you so! Just this last May, Neue Osnabr cke Zeitung, a German news source, reported that Germany s Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has received 369 tip-offs on possible links between refugees and Muslim extremists. German police announced that at least forty asylum seekers were being investigated for alleged terrorism links. It was reported that Germany s spy chief, Hans Georg Maassen, said that Germany s domestic intelligence agency had obtained  strong evidence that  17 people have arrived under Islamic State instructions.  [Emphasis added.] Furthermore, last month, German authorities announced that 499 Islamists were under surveillance, ostensibly because there is credible evidence that they pose a threat. It is not clear if this figure also includes homegrown Islamists.So we now know for certain that some Islamist terrorists have taken advantage of the massive influx of refugees and have successfully infiltrated Europe   and on ISIS  orders. Furthermore, there are undoubtedly even more pending investigations, and it is certain that many Islamist terrorist cells with refugee connections are operating within Europe as of this writing.The largely Muslim migrants have brought no shortage of problems with them: there have been refugee-caused sexual assaults across European cities, increased radicalization of Muslim circles, a lack of assimilation, persecution of Christian migrants, etc. These problems serve to exasperate the assimilation problems that already plague many second-generation Europeans whose parents are from Muslim-majority countries. Given that European birthrates are generally below replacement levels, and that the massive influx of immigrants is, although stemmed in some quarters, still occurring, these problems will unfortunately only become more acute as time goes by. The late Libyan President Mu amar al-Gaddafi once said, alluding to Muslim immigration to Europe, that the Islamization of Europe would happen without the need for the sword. But he surely didn t expect it would happen as fast as we are witnessing now.Since the vast majority of the refugees are Muslims whose culture clashes with native European ones on several well-known fronts, this influx has naturally resulted in growing anti-Islamic sentiment in Europe. It is reported that nationalist and rightist groups are gaining ascendency With the increase in the number of Islamic terrorist acts happening all around the world, including in the heart of the European Union, Europeans certainly have a right to be worried any encroaching Islamism.Via: Counter Jihad",politics,"Jul 22, 2016"
14990,ESTABLISHMENT GOP END TIMES? Why Republican Candidates Are Kicking RNC To Curb,"In the real world, if your boss is damaging your ability to achieve your full potential, you start looking for a new place of employment. Why should these candidate settle for an organization who isn t representing their best interests? The 2016 GOP presidential campaigns agreed on Sunday evening to cut the Republican National Committee (RNC) out of the debate negotiation process and instead deal directly with networks moderating debates, Breitbart News has learned.Corey Lewandowski, the campaign manager for frontrunner Donald Trump, confirmed to Breitbart News via phone on Sunday that the  biggest consensus  of five separate points the GOP campaigns agreed on was cutting the RNC out of the negotiations with the networks, as the campaigns would each like to negotiate with the networks directly.In response to the revelation that the RNC will be cut out of the process, RNC chief spokesman Sean Spicer the party s point man on handling debates until now said the RNC stands ready to help the candidates in any way they can. The RNC is fully committed to serving the interests of our campaigns,  Spicer told Breitbart News.  We support the best format to present their vision to lead America forward. A campaign manager with another campaign who wished not to be identified confirmed to Breitbart News that the RNC will no longer be handling debate format and that the  campaigns will take the lead  on that. The RNC will still handle basic logistics, though, that campaign manager said.The second point of agreement was that they want information from the networks on things such as qualification criteria earlier than before, Lewandowski said, and third was they want  greater parity and greater integrity  in questions. A fourth point of agreement, according to Lewandowski, was they want debates to last no longer than two hours including commercials and a fifth is they want each candidate to get at least 30 seconds apiece for opening and for closing statements. Mr. Trump has won the last three debates, and he is willing to continue to debate his opponents,  Lewandowski told Breitbart News.  However, the moderators of the debates should not be the story. Instead, the candidates  responses to questions is what the American public should hear. The meeting happened at the Hilton in Alexandria, Virginia, in Old Town on King Street just outside Washington, D.C.Most of the details of what various campaigns wanted was already made public heading into the meeting.  Ben Carson s campaign manager, Barry Bennett, was hopeful that the group could agree on one two-hour debate with every candidate onstage,  the Washington Post s Bob Costa and Dave Weigel reported.They also quoted former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee s campaign manager Sarah Huckabee Sanders, laying out a previously public demand from campaigns. One of the big goals is allowing for more substance and equal time,  Sanders said.  It does make that difficult if there are multiple candidates but the debate s capped at two hours. But the revelation that the RNC will no longer be a part of the debate process has not yet been reported until now.During the meeting, too, according to Costa and Weigel, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush s campaign manager Danny Diaz pushed unsuccessfully for Telemundo to get reinstated as a moderator something Trump would boycott. Bush campaign manager Danny Diaz recommended that Telemundo be reinstated after being dropped along with NBC,  Costa and Weigel wrote.  But the campaign of businessman Donald Trump, represented by manager Corey Lewandowski, threatened to boycott a debate if the Spanish-language network that Trump has clashed with was granted one. Telemundo was supposed to partner with NBC News, but after CNBC s horrendous moderating job in Boulder, Colorado, last week lost its upcoming debate along with partner network NBC News.This revelation also means a last-ditch effort by the RNC to keep control of the process has failed.Via: Matthew Boyle, Breitbart News",politics,"Nov 2, 2015"
2647," Trump’s List Of ‘Unreported’ Terror Attacks Is Out, And It’s ABSURD (CITATIONS)","Earlier today, Trump said to a crowd at MacDill Air Force Base that the  very dishonest media  wasn t reporting on the terror attacks that are happening all across Europe all the time. Later on, the media pressed Sean Spicer on that topic while aboard Air Force One, and Spicer s response was to say that they d provide a list  later on.  Well, that list is out, and surprise surprise, it s completely ridiculous.Since Trump s comments focused on Europe and, by extension, the U.S., the following lists are focused there, despite many, many other attacks happening around the world.Perhaps one of the most ridiculous things about the White House s list of attacks is that it includes high-profile attacks that were covered for days on end, such as the 2015 attack against Charlie Hebdo in Paris, and the fateful attack at a Paris club in November. It also includes two foiled attacks that were also widely reported. Broken down:They also list several attacks in France in 2016 that were covered extensively.Then they list an attack in London in December 2015 that was covered by CNN, Reuters, The Huffington Post, USA Today, and more.There s one in Copenhagen, Denmark in February of 2015 that was covered by CNN, The New York Times, USA Today, The Huffington Post, Reuters, and more.Most of us probably remember the March 2016 attack in Brussels, Belgium, which was covered by CNN, NPR, The New York Times, CBS News, NBC News, USA Today, ABC News, and more.But that s Europe. What about the attacks they list here in the U.S. that supposedly weren t covered, or weren t covered extensively enough? Like the following:Really? So far we ve looked closely at 18 of the attacks listed, and they were all widely covered by U.S. media. Trump and his minions insist that we re not covering attacks in Europe hardly at all, and then they provide a list with 30 attacks that are in the Middle East, parts of Asia, and in Indonesia and the Philippines.Those attacks are terrible and tragic, too, but again, Trump didn t say anything about us not covering attacks in those regions. He probably didn t even think about those regions until whoever it was that compiled that list gave it to him (if they gave it to him).But the biggest falsehood is that the media isn t reporting, or is underreporting, on these attacks. It s like they hurriedly compiled a list of terror attacks worldwide from Wikipedia and couldn t be bothered to proofread, let alone research. There are spelling errors in addition to the lie that the media covers up attacks. Our dishonest  president,  has a lot of nerve accusing the media of actively covering up terrorist attacks.The full list, as provided to CNN, is below. Feel free to Google whatever you want:Here s the list the White House sent of attacks they feel  did not receive adequate attention from Western media sources.  pic.twitter.com/lj8eOZQfnY  Kevin Liptak (@Kevinliptakcnn) February 7, 2017Read more:Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images",News,"February 6, 2017"
6650, Hatred For The Republican Party Reaches 25 Year High,"It s now no surprise that Donald Trump, the most hated presidential candidate in the field, is the GOP s frontrunner. It seems being hated is all the Republican Party is good for these days.And there s even better news for Democrats!A new poll from the Pew Research Center shows that the GOP is overwhelmingly hated by the American public and has reached its highest level of disdain since 1992. According to the poll, 62 percent of Americans have an unfavorable impression of the GOP whereas only 33 percent view it favorably. American s positive perception of the GOP fell four points in the last six months.The poll also found a very interesting trend: most of the negativity towards the GOP came from self-identified Republicans, where only 68 had a favorable view of their own party   an 11 point drop from October.As Trump rises is in the polls, Republicans feelings about their party falls. What a coincidence.In contrast, 45 percent of Americans had a favorable view of the Democratic Party versus 50 percent who harbored negative views. Eighty-eight percent of Democrats had a favorable view of the party.Not surprisingly, Independent voters were more favorable to the Democratic Party   preferring them 37 to 28 percent   than the Republican Party. As Trump continuously tells the public he s winning with Independents, he certainly hasn t been very successful. Also not surprising was respondents who were black, female or young were also much more likely to give favorable impressions of the Democratic Party compared to the GOP.When broken down, the poll reminds us of what we already know:White people, in general, are almost identical in how they feel about both parties; 37 percent have a favorable view of both parties, while 59 percent have an unfavorable view of the Democrats and 58 percent for the Republicans.It looks like the two-party system has failed the oppressed whites yet again   how sad.Over 2,000 Americans responded to the poll, which was conducted between April 12 to 19 and it has a margin of error at 2.5 percent.Featured image via John Sommers II/Getty Images",News,"April 28, 2016"
8129, Michele Bachmann Comes Out Of Hiding To Mourn Scalia On Twitter — Gets His Name Wrong (TWEETS),"Michele Bachmann is easily one of the craziest people to ever grace the halls of Congress. She spent her entire tenure being a complete embarrassment and disgrace to the institution which she served, spending more time ranting about abortion, religion, and gay people than actually, you know, trying to govern. All sane people were giddy with glee when she decided not to run for re-election. Shortly thereafter, she faded into the bowels of the more humiliating and shameful parts of America s history, right where she belongs.Well, with the death of extreme right-wing Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, former Congresswoman Bachmann has emerged from her vampire crypt to tell the world just how much she admired the man. She sent out a tweet just hours after his death that read: God Bless Anthony Scalia, finest Sup Ct Justice RIP God bless Anthony Scalia, finest Sup Ct Justice RIP  Michele Bachmann (@MicheleBachmann) February 13, 2016There s just one problem with that: his name is Antonin Scalia, not Anthony. This nitwit can t even get that much right, yet, after that major f*ck up, Bachmann went on to go on a tirade about who should replace the deceased Justice, and, of course, only other extreme right-wingers are even a little bit acceptable to her. Here is that series of insane tweets:Obama must appoint a constitutional originalist to replace Justice Scalia, nothing else will do.

17234,BREAKING: SUPREME COURT BLOCKS TEXAS ABORTION RESTRICTIONS,"Wow! The liberal Supreme Court s really making their views known with the past few decisions. Thank goodness for the ACLJ and all the good work they do: This afternoon, the Supreme Court of the United States ordered to stay the Fifth Circuit s ruling upholding the common-sense abortion restrictions passed by Texas in 2013. In a 5-4 vote with Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito dissenting, the Court granted the application to stay the 5th Circuit decision.As The New York Times reports:The Supreme Court on Monday allowed nine Texas abortion clinics to remain open while the justices consider whether to hear an appeal from a decision effectively ordering them to close. [ ]The case concerns two parts of a state law that imposes strict requirements on abortion providers. One requires all abortion clinics in the state to meet the standards for  ambulatory surgical centers,  including regulations concerning buildings, equipment and staffing. The other requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.Other parts of the law took effect in 2013, causing about half of the state s 41 abortion clinics to close. If the contested provisions take effect, abortion rights advocates said, the number of clinics will again be halved. The Associated Press has more details:The Supreme Court order will remain in effect at least until the court decides whether to hear the clinics  appeal of the lower court ruling, not before the fall.The court s decision to block the regulations is a strong indication that the justices will hear the full appeal, which could be the biggest abortion case at the Supreme Court in nearly 25 years. The ACLJ is mobilizing all of our resources to continue to support Texas as it stands up for the health of women and the lives of unborn babies.At the Fifth Circuit, we filed an amicus brief detailing the dangers of unregulated abortion and the abortion industry s deceptions.We are preparing to file briefs at the Supreme Court to vigorously defend this pro-life law and aggressively protect the lives of thousands of unborn babies and women in need.Our pro-life advocacy is vital in defending the constitutional rights of pro-life crisis pregnancy centers, protecting the health of women and children, and urging Congress to be a voice for the voiceless.Via: ACLJ ",Government News,"Jun 29, 2015"
17549,ONE IMAGE PERFECTLY Captures Who’s Really Behind The Trump-Russian Collusion “Investigation”,"Unfounded claims that President Trump was filmed with prostitutes in a Moscow hotel surfaced in the closing stretch of last year s White House race.Mrs. Clinton s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) reportedly helped fund the research.According to US media reports, Perkins Coie, a law firm representing the Clinton campaign and DNC, hired intelligence firm Fusion GPS in April 2016.  BBCYesterday, another bombshell was revealed by Rep. Jim Jordan on the Lou Dobbs show, when Jordan told Dobbs that he believes the FBI paid Christopher Steele, the creator of the Trump dossier and that they used it to obtain a FISA warrant to spy on Americans associated with the Trump campaign. Jordon told Dobbs:  There are a couple of fundamental questions here. Did the FBI pay Christopher Steele? I asked that of the Attorney General two weeks ago he wouldn t answer the question. Did they actually vet this dossier?  Because it s been disproven, a bunch of lies, a bunch of National Enquirer garbage and fake news in this thing. Did they actually check it out before they brought it to the FISA Court which I m convinced they did. And all of this can be cleared up if they release the application that they took to the court  I think they won t give it to us because they did pay Christopher Steele. I think they did use the dossier as the basis for the warrants to spy on Americans associated with President Trump s campaign. Strzok is the guy who took the dossier to the FISA Court.

4186, WATCH: Fox News Host Dana Perino Is DONE Defending Republicans,"Fox News host Dana Perino is finally so sick and tired of Republicans supporting Donald Trump despite all of the sexual assault allegations that she will no longer defend them.During Friday s edition of The Five, host and former George W. Bush press secretary Dana Perino slammed Donald Trump for  talking about all of his accusers  and insulting them instead of focusing on attacking Hillary Clinton.Perino is also furious that Republicans are still defending Trump s predatory behavior. The Republicans that are defending this are really irritating me,  she said.  I ve been like Mount Vesuvius all day. Perino then specifically named Ben Carson and Jeff Sessions as just two of the many Republicans who remain on board the Trump train despite the Republican nominee s comments about groping women and the various allegations made against him by multiple women and the many past statements he has made that are now coming back to haunt him.And after Juan Williams joked that someone is going to call for cutting her mic, Perino took a serious tone, looked straight into the camera and while slicing the air with her hand told Republicans that she is  done  defending them. Yeah, because women should be seen and not heard, apparently. After 20 years of defending these guys, done. Here s the video via YouTube.Perino is not the only Republican woman who has stopped defending Republicans due to their refusal to unendorse Trump.Wisconsin GOP activist Marybeth Glenn quit the party entirely in a series of posts on Twitter blasting Republicans for being cowards and legitimizing charges that conservatives are sexists after she defended them for years. He (Trump) treats women like dogs, and you go against everything I   and other female conservatives   said you were & back down like cowards,  she wrote.  I m sooo done. If you can t stand up for women & unendorse this piece of human garbage, you deserve every charge of sexism thrown at you. Now Perino just became the first Republican woman on Fox News to say she is done defending the GOP.In their refusal to withdraw their support from Trump, the Republican Party is destroying themselves by offending women across the country and now it is costing them allies in states and in the media. This is something that may take generations for the party to recover from. Of course, that s assuming they actually learn anything from the mess they made this year.Featured image via screenshot",News,"October 15, 2016"

22752,VANISHED: ‘Hero Security Guard’ and Star Witness of Las Vegas Shooting is Missing,"TWO PROTAGONISTS: Jesus Campos, and alleged shooter Stephen Paddock.Last week, 21WIRE reported how the Las Vegas police and FBI had suddenly changed their story of the timeline of events associated with Mandalay Bay security guard  hero  and police star witness, Jesus Campos and the alleged shooter Stephen Paddock. *Note*   The Las Vegas mass shooting, currently modern America s deadliest, has already been cycled out of most trending media reports in less than two weeks, as most mainstream outlets have now focused the public s attention on a ready-to-go show trial involving disgraced Hollywood movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. In addition, reportage by former Project Veritas operative Laura Loomer, suggests that the Campos family may have had a gag order placed on them not to talk about the mass-shooting case.Now we can report that Jesus Campos is missing.This has all the hallmarks of a cover-up. Not surprisingly, the mainstream media appear to be disinterested in this story now.FOX News confirmed this morning:The Mandalay Bay security guard who disappeared last week moments before he was scheduled to break his silence in television interviews has not been seen since he went to a walk-in health clinic, his union president said.David Hickey of the Security, Police, and Fire Professionals of America (SPFPA) told reporters Friday that he got a text the night before saying Jesus Campos was taken to a UMC Quick Care facility, though he did not specify where or whom the text came from.A spokesperson at the UMC Quick Care, which has eight locations throughout the Las Vegas area, told Fox News on Monday that they had  heard nothing  about Campos visiting them.Multiple requests from Fox News for SPFPA to comment on the matter were not returned Monday.Hickey said he was meeting with MGM officials Thursday afternoon in the hours before Campos  scheduled television appearances, including one with Fox News.LAS VEGAS SECURITY GUARD JESUS CAMPOS DISAPPEARS MOMENTS BEFORE TV INTERVIEWS For the past four days he s been preparing   we had a meeting with MGM officials, and after that meeting was over, we talked about the interviews, we went to a private area, and when we came out, Mr. Campos was gone,  Hickey told reporters, according to Fox 5 Las Vegas.Hickey said Campos had requested to go public and wanted to tell his story and move on from the Oct. 1 shooting investigation. Police say he was shot just before the crazed gunman killed 58 at music festival on the Las Vegas Strip   though the sequence of events is still in dispute.Campos was last photographed in public on Oct. 10, accepting an  SPFPA Hero Award  for bravery in the line of duty, while dining with Hickey and others at a high-end Vegas steakhouse. But soon afterward, investigators said that the security guard was shot before the massacre, raising questions about whether the hotel did enough to prevent the bloodshed.Hickey has said that before he vanished, Campus was looking forward to telling his side of the story. Right now I m just concerned where my member is, and what his condition is. It s highly unusual,  Hickey said Friday.  I m hoping everything is OK with him and I m sure MGM or the union will let (media) know when we hear something,  he said.(Fox News  Greg Norman contributed to this report)SEE ALSO: The Las Vegas Mass Shooting   More to the Story Than We ve Been ToldREAD MORE DAILY SHOOTER NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Daily Shooter FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"October 17, 2017"
17535,THE LIST of 34 House Republicans DEMANDING Permanent AMNESTY For Obama’s DACA “Kids”,"Who wants to deport  Dreamers ? Not many people, it turns out. Even veteran immigration restrictionists seem willing to legalize this subset of immigrants in the country illegally if it is part of a package deal. That s true even though a lot of what s said about the DACA recipients is PR-style hooey.For example, it s often said   indeed, former President Barack Obama just recently said   that the approximately 800,000 of them were  brought to this country by their parents.  Well, many were. But that s not required to qualify as a protected Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program recipient under the various plans, including Obama s. You just have to have entered the country illegally before age 16. You could have decided to sneak in against your parents  wishes. You re still a  Dreamer! Likewise, we re told DACA recipients are college-bound high school grads or military personnel. That s an exaggeration. All that s actually required is that the person enroll in a high school course or an  alternative,  including online courses and English-as-a-second-language classes. Under Obama s now-suspended program, you didn t even have to stay enrolled.Compared with the general population, DACA recipients are not especially highly skilled. A recent survey for several pro- Dreamer  groups, with participants recruited by those groups, found that while most DACA recipients are not in school, the vast majority work. But their median hourly wage is only $15.34, meaning that many are competing with hard-pressed lower-skilled Americans.The DACA recipients you read about have typically been carefully selected for their appeal. They re valedictorians. They re first responders. They re curing diseases. They root for the Yankees. They want to serve in the Army. If DACA recipients are the poster children for the much larger population of immigrants in the country illegally, these are the poster children for the poster children.  Chicago Tribune34 Republicans in Congress are not about to let the pesky facts about Obama s  Dreamers  get in the way of lobbying Speaker Ryan to grant them permanent citizenship.Numbers USA reports  Thirty-four Republicans in the House of Representatives signed a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan calling for passage of a permanent DACA amnesty before the end of the year. Reps. Scott Taylor (R-Va.) and Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.) led the effort.While the lawmakers stop short of demanding passage of a DACA amnesty before the end of the year or including an amnesty in this month s must-pass spending bill, they don t insist on any other immigration-related provisions that would stop future flows of illegal immigration by calling for mandatory E-Verify or to reduce the numerical impact of the amnesty by calling for an end to Chain Migration.The letter reads:Dear Speaker Ryan,We write in support of passing of a permanent legislative solution for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients before the end of the year. DACA recipients   young people brought to America through no fault of their own   are contributing members of our communities and our economy. For many, this is the only country they have ever known. They are American in every way except their immigration status.Since DACA s inception, the federal government has approved approximately 795,000 initial DACA applications and 924,000 renewals. Since being approved for DACA status, an overwhelming majority of these individuals have enrolled in school, found employment, or have served in the military. Studies have shown that passing legislation to permanently protect these individuals would add hundreds of billions to our country s gross domestic product (GDP). That is why the business community, universities, and civic leaders alike support a permanent legislative solution.We agree with President Trump that executive action was not the appropriate process for solving this issue, as was done under the previous administration, and we believe Congress should act. We are compelled to act immediately because many DACA recipients are about to lose or have already lost their permits in the wake of the program s rescission. Not acting is creating understandable uncertainty and anxiety amongst immigrant communities.While we firmly believe Congress must work to address other issues within our broken immigration system, it is imperative that Republicans and Democrats come together to solve this problem now and not wait until next year. We all agree that our border must be enforced, our national security defended, and our broken immigration system reformed, but in this moment, we must address the urgent matter before us in a balanced approach that does not harm valuable sectors of our economy nor the lives of these hard-working young people. We must pass legislation that protects DACA recipients from deportation and gives them the opportunity to apply for a more secured status in our country as soon as possible. Reaching across the aisle to protect DACA recipients before the holidays is the right thing to do.Here s the list of 34 Republicans who need to be drained from the swamp:Rep. Scott Taylor (VA-2) Rep.

12293,WHOA! IS GEORGE SOROS Secretly Funding Jill Stein’s [Hillary’s] Recount Effort To Steal The Presidency From Trump?,"A post on Reddit citing an investigative journalist reads as follows:  RED ALERT! JIM STONE DISCOVERS SOROS BOT FUNDING JILL STEIN S RECOUNT CAMPAIGN AT RATE OF $160,000/HOUR!!!! DO NOT FALL ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL, BIG TIME F*CKERY IS AFOOT!!! According to the post a donations to Jill Stein s election recount campaign are being made at a steady rate of $160,000 on the hour every hour of the day.The constant rate of donation, 24 hours a day, suggest that a computer program is being used to post the donations as opposed to real people making grassroots donation.However, the donations are being reported as grassroots donations from a myriad of online supporters to help her verify the integrity of the election.However, if real individuals are in fact making the actual donations they rate of the donations should drop over night when internet traffic is low.The rate should then steadily pick up during the course of the day up and then culminate during the  internet rush hour  when usage peaks, which is usually between 7 and 11 PM.For example the BBC,  the UK s equivalent of CNN, reports hourly average internet usage usage is as follows:If Jill Stein s recount campaign was real and donations are in fact coming in from real grass roots supporters then donations to the campaign should reflect this curve in some manner.However, they do not follow the curve of typical internet..Instead they are coming in at a constant hourly rate of $160,000 per hour every hour on the hour.To illustrate, HNN has compile this graph of Stein s donations per hour superimposed on the BBC s graph of internet usage per hour by device.The graph illustrates Jill Stein s recount donations in orange with a red outline which plots recount donations coming in at a constant rate of 4.16% per hour.It is impossible for Jill Stein s recount campaign to be receiving the same amount of donations from real online users every hour on the hour when real internet usage among devices varies widely hour to hour, specifically it peaks in the evening and becomes virtually non-existent between 1 am and 6 am in the morning.This clearly indicates the donations to the recount campaign are not from  grassroots internet users  but instead are the result of a computer programmed bot which is working behind the scenes to fund the campaign.It is almost as perplexing that Jill Stein s managed to raise in less than 24 hours more money than she has raised throughout her entire campaign but that is another story. Namely, Hillary Clinton is having Jill dirty her hands to demand a recount so Hillary is not implicated in not accepting the results of the election.It is still uncertain there is even a prima facie case for Stein to even demand a recount given she failed to capture more than 2% of the vote in any state. If Republicans stand their ground on this argument, Hillary will have to step out from behind her proxy and get her own hands hands dirty to force a recount to happen.Via Reddit:",politics,"Nov 26, 2016"
8891, Seth Meyers Dubs Oregon Militia Terrorist #Tarpman In Most Hilarious Mockery Yet (VIDEO),"The domestic terrorists who are holed up in the federal building of an Oregon wildlife refuge get more ridiculous by the day. Perhaps the most bizarre scene from this insanity yet has been a guy who is sitting in the middle of a vacant lot underneath a blue tarp with nothing but his penis extension rifle for comfort. Of course, despite the absolutely serious nature of this armed occupation, the ridiculousness of it all definitely gives plenty of material to late night comics, and comedian Seth Meyers has taken full advantage of that.On Wednesday night s edition of his show, Meyers dubbed this particular militia idiot  Tarpman,  and proceed to mock him relentlessly. Luckily, MSNBC s Lawrence O Donnell was kind enough to share the hilarity with us.First, the clip showed the local sheriff trying to be sensible and get these yahoos to leave. Then, it panned to  Tarpman  hiding with his gun. After that, we see Seth Meyers relentlessly mocking this insanity. He even called  Tarpman  a  guess in a game of militia Clue.

18756,NANCY PELOSI’S Latest Over-The-Top Claim: Trump will “take food out of the mouths of babies and seniors”,"Nancy Pelosi s latest claim is over the top:In a conference call with reporters, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, criticized Trump s late push for some funding for the wall now, which she said would be wrong if it was budgeted for at the expense of government programs like those that help young people, the elderly and the environment. He did not promise that he would take food out of the mouths of babies and seniors and education, clean air, clean water, scientific research off the table in a significant way in order for him to pay for his immoral, ineffective, unwise proposal of a wall,  Pelosi said.But she said she was open to some technology and other improvements at the border so long as they were not related in any way to the planning, prepping or building of the wall itself. Read more: The HillHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was on Meet the Press and let out another gibberish laden response to a question. Does anyone out there understand what she meant by her comments about the wall. How does it mean Trump is weak if he wants a wall? Twisted reasoning is all that comes from Pelosi these days especially when in 2006 most prominent Democrats voted to build a barrier at the border. Immoral and unwise ? How is it immoral and unwise to want to protect your people? You have to understand this part of the country. There s a community going through it. WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED TO THE 2006 BORDER WALL FENCE?Remember the promise of a fence on our southern border? Yes, it was the plan but the $1.2 billion dollar plan was never executed as proposed. You can thank our Liar in Chief and a popular Republican for that WE RECENTLY POSTED THIS VIDEO OF AN IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL SAYING BUILDING A BORDER FENCE  ISN T POSSIBLE  EVEN THOUGH $1.2 BILLION WAS GIVEN IN 2006 FOR A FENCE:  In his speech in El Paso on immigration reform on May 10, 2011, Obama declared that the fence along the border with Mexico is  now basically complete.  Like much of what comes out of the Obama administration, that was a lie. What was supposed to be built was a double layered fence with barbed-wire on top, and room for a security vehicle to patrol between the layers. Except for 36 of the seven-hundred mile fence, what was built looks like the picture above or the one below.But that doesn t stop your liar in chief. He claims. We have gone above and beyond what was requested by the very Republicans who said they supported broader reform as long as we got serious about enforcement,  Obama said.  All the stuff they asked for, we ve done. But even though we ve answered these concerns, I ve got to say I suspect there are still going to be some who are trying to move the goal posts on us one more time. Maybe he s right the goal posts were moved, but to make the job easier.The Secure Fence Act was introduced on Sept. 13, 2006 by Rep Peter King (R-NY) and passed Congress on a bi-partisan basis. In the House of Representatives, the Fence Act passed 283 -138 on September 14, 2006. On September 29, 2006, the Fence Act passed in the Senate 80 -19. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 s goal was to help secure America s borders to decrease illegal entry, drug trafficking, and security threats by building 700 miles (1,100 km) of physical barriers along the Mexico-United States border. Additionally, the law authorized more vehicle barriers, checkpoints, and lighting as well as authorizing the Department of Homeland Security to increase the use of advanced technology such as cameras, satellites, and unmanned aerial vehicles to reinforce infrastructure at the border. So far less than 40 miles of a real fence have been built   most of it during the Bush Administration.Of the almost 700 miles of fencing, DHS reports there are currently 36.3 miles of double-layered fencing, as the bill required, the kind with enough gap that you can drive a vehicle between the layers. But the majority of the fencing erected has been made from vehicle barriers with single-layer pedestrian fencing, the kind of barriers that are designed to stop vehicles rather than people. The design specifications vary, depending on geography and climate characteristics, but according to the Customs and Border Patrol website, those include  post on rail  steel set in concrete; steel picket-style fence set in concrete; vehicle bollards similar to those found around federal buildings;  Normandy; vehicle fence consisting of steel beams; and concrete jersey walls with steel mesh. The first blow against the promised fence was made by Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican Senator from Texas, at the urging of DHS she proposed an amendment to give the Department discretion to decide what type of fence was appropriate in different areas. The law was amended to read,  Nothing in this paragraph shall require the Secretary of Homeland Security to install fencing, physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors in a particular location along an international border of the United States, if the Secretary determines that the use or placement of such resources is not the most appropriate means to achieve and maintain operational control over the international border at such location.  Hutchison s amendment was included in a federal budget bill in late 2007 despite the fact that Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., had a cow he argued the amendment effectively killed the border fence promised in the 2006 bill, he was right. Hutchison s intentions may have been honorable, but she didn t foresee Barack Obama being the next president.When Janet Napolitano became Obama s first DHS she took advantage of Ms. Hutchison s 2007 amendment, instead of building a fence which look something like the below, she built a fence that was mostly a combination of the two pictures above.When She was still Governor of Arizona Janet Napolitano said,  You show me a 50-foot wall, and I ll show you a 51-foot ladder at the border. And she may be right The fence will never STOP all illegal crossings. The purpose of the fence is two-fold, slowing the intruders and making them visible to members of the border patrol. The rest of the work is done by human beings.Very little of the Israeli separation barrier erected to keep out terrorists is a wall, most of the 400 miles of the barrier which has received so much international scorn is a two layered fence like section of their barrier below. The fence has served its purpose, in 2002, the year before construction started, 457 Israelis were murdered; in 2009, 8 Israelis were killed.The reason it has been effective is not simply the fence itself but how the fence is guarded and patrolled. And that s what will make our fence along the Mexican border work.Here s the bottom line. Back in 2006 the people of the U.S. were promised a border fence. Since then thanks to Kay Bailey Hutchison and Barack Obama 95% of the fence wasn t built. The arguments against the fence are bogus especially if you look at Israel s history. It s time for America to demand that its leaders build the fence they promised. No one can honestly say it wont work, after all it hasn t been tried. Via: The Lid",left-news,"Apr 25, 2017"

Panhandlers Living In High Rent Neighborhoods?,"With homeless or needy people on just about every corner, how do we know who truly needs help, or who is just looking to game the system? This undercover expose on the explosion of  homeless  people on just about every corner in suburban Detroit shines a light on the  business  of panhandling. Should panhandling be protected by the First Amendment?Panhandlers standing on the corners has become an increasing issue. Men, women, old and young, all begging for your money.The problem has moved from the city to the suburbs, but why? And, should you give?It seems to have happened in recent months. Panhandlers, everywhere, including American s first highway, Woodward Avenue.They hold signs and pull at your heart strings. Some claim to be homeless, to have cancer, or be a veteran who is hungry. But, are we being conned?We spotted a young guy at the corner of Woodward Avenue and Maple on a recent Friday afternoon panhandling. Moments later, we watched as he folded up his sign and walked to a nearby parking lot where he got into a dark colored SUV.We spotted the same SUV on different occasions at a house in a nice neighborhood in West Bloomfield. When confronted, the young guy first closed the door without answering if he considered what he was doing fraud.Moments later, after being exposed, he came out, profanities flying   upset he was going to be on TV.To some, panhandling has become a job. Honest Abe  and his crew work the corner at 8 Mile and Woodward daily. He even accepts credit cards, but says he is truly homeless and panhandling frauds are becoming more frequent.The problem is growing. Corners that were once off limits are now prime real estate and a recent court ruling involving the Michigan Chapter of the ACLU allows it to happen. Court said conduct of asking for money in public is a form of free speech, it must be protected by the First Amendment.  Attorney Ryan Berman told 7 Action News.We discovered many panhandlers work in teams, sharing signs and corners. Some use your money to buy food, others trade the cash for drugs, booze or cigarettes.Elizabeth Kelly with Hope Shelter in Pontiac says if you want to really help, there are other ways to give.

16107,BOOM! KELLYANNE CONWAY Schools CNN’s Anderson Cooper On The Comey Firing [Video],"Kellyanne Conway went at it with Anderson Cooper and came out on top when she basically schooled Cooper on the chain of command in government. The facts make no sense to him because he s in denial. Conway said Trump s decision to fire James Comey had nothing to do with the FBI s investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election. She goes on to explain to Cooper that the letter recommending that Comey be fired was sent to President Trump. Was Trump supposed to then deny the Assistant Attorney General s decision? It s good to note that the Assistant AG was just confirmed by over 90% of the Senate. He s a bipartisan choice and a well respected man who came into his position under AG Jeff Sessions just two weeks ago. The letter sent to Trump summarized the numerous things that prove the case for the recommendation of firing Comey. TRUMP DID NOT DO THIS ALONE But you have the fake news media beating the RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA drums over and over.Watch how Kellyanne Conway runs circles around Anderson Cooper while Cooper just keeps coming back to the Russia scenario: It s not a cover up. The president makes it very clear in his letter. Comey assured him he s not under investigation. I think you re looking at wrong set of facts here. You re going back to the campaign. This man is president of the United States. He acted decisively today. You want this to be about Russia when this is about restoring public confidence in the FBI The FBI director reports to deputy attorney general, the deputy attorney general reports to the attorney general and the attorney general reports to the president of the United States. This has nothing to do with Russia. It has everything to do with whether the current FBI director has the president s confidence and can faithfully and capably execute his duties.

9634,HILLARY WORKED FEVERISHLY To Return 10 Russian Spies Operating In U.S. In Midst Of Selling 20% Of U.S. Uranium To Russia,"Why is this not front page news on every major media outlet?Russian intelligence targeted Hillary Clinton before she became secretary of state in 2009, FBI documents show.New FBI information about corruption in a Clinton-approved uranium deal with Russia raises questions about Clinton s actions after the FBI broke up a deep-cover Russian spy ring in 2010.For a decade, the FBI ran an operation called Ghost Stories to monitor and rip apart a deep-cover Russian agent network. Ghost Stories tracked a ring Russian spies who lived between Boston and Washington, D.C., under false identities. It was one of the FBI s most elaborate and successful counterintelligence operations in history.After the FBI arrested 10 of the spies in June, 2010, Secretary of State Clinton worked feverishly to return the Russian agents to Moscow in a hastily arranged, lopsided deal with Putin.It all happened as the uranium deal was in play: An arrangement to provide Moscow s state Rosatom nuclear agency with 20 percent of American uranium capacity, with $145,000,000 to pour into the Clinton Family Foundation and its projects.For the Clintons, the FBI s biggest counterintelligence bust in history couldn t have come at a worse time.The day the FBI arrested the Russian agents, on June 28, 2010, the day before the secretary of state s husband, Bill Clinton, was to give a speech in Moscow. A Kremlin-connected investment bank, Renaissance Capital, paid the former president $500,000 for the hour-long appearance.An unnamed Hillary Clinton spokesman told ABC News that there was  no reason to think the Secretary was a target of this spy ring. That was a lie.Under the code name Operation Ghost Stories, the FBI had been working the ring for a decade. Its targets had burrowed in along the Acela Corridor between Boston, New York, and Washington DC. They lived normal daily lives as Americans to attend universities, run businesses, marry, and conceive and raise children to infiltrate society and subvert government institutions. One of the SVR agents had stolen the identity of a six-week-old Canadian baby who had died in 1963. That prompted the Ghost Stories code name. The ring inspired the FX network s television series,  The Americans. As with any secretary of state, Hillary Clinton would be a primary target under any circumstance. But she was much more. She was a known quantity: predictable, vain and ruthless, and with an insatiable desire for cash to enrich her family, friends, and political machine. Blindly ambitious to become president of the world s only superpower and swearing to come back after losing in 2008 to Barack Obama, she was the 21st century KGB s perfect mark.Read more: Daily Caller",politics,"Oct 21, 2017"
16757,POPE SHAMES AMERICANS From Mexico For Anti-Immigrant Sentiment…Doesn’t Mention $BILLIONS Taxpayers Give Faith Based Charities To Bring MUSLIM Immigrants To U.S.,"Pope Francis has joined Democrat legislators, along with a handful of RINO s and local mayors to work hand-in-hand with Obama to push immigration from Mexico and South America to the US.  Every player in this scheme has their own agenda. Of course, Obama has only one desire, and that is to fundamentally transform America. Democrat legislators are working to secure a dependent voting base. The RINO s (Republicans In Name Only) are beholden to large corporations, whose only goal is to secure cheap labor. Finally, local mayors want the federal funding that comes with placement of each immigrant in their communities. Besides the obvious charitable aspect, what s in it for Pope Francis? What s in it for the Catholic church? Many Catholics (myself included) are wondering why we pass the collection basket more than once several times throughout the year to help subsidize churches, schools and orphanages in Mexico and South America if the ultimate goal is to bring them here? Make no mistake, Pope Francis is interjecting himself into the 2016 Presidential election by walking with illegal aliens on the Mexican side of the border who want to get into the US.This is a direct assault by the Catholic Church on Donald Trump and any other Republicans (including the Governor of Texas) who say they want to close the US border with Mexico.Yesterday, in Ciudad Juarez, one of the most violent cities in the Western Hemisphere thanks to the drug cartels, the pope walked up a ramp covered in flowers toward a cross  erected  in memory of migrants who have perished trying to reach the United States just a stone s throw away,  according to Reuters.The pope then blessed three more small crosses, at which  shoes of migrants who died  were laid.  We cannot deny the humanitarian crisis,  Pope Francis intoned.  Each step, a journey laden with grave injustices: the enslaved, the imprisoned and extorted; so many of these brothers and sisters of ours are the consequence of trafficking in human beings Injustice is radicalized in the young; they are  cannon fodder,  persecuted and threatened when they try to flee the spiral of violence and the hell of drugs. Then there are the many women unjustly robbed of their lives. He concluded,  Let us together ask our God for the gift of conversion, the gift of tears, let us ask him to give us open hearts like the Ninevites, open to his call heard in the suffering faces of countless men and women. No more death! No more exploitation! They are not refugees! People escaping poverty or crime are not legally refugees, but the Pope and the NO Borders Left are purposefully confusing the terminology. They want all migrants-on-the-move to be called REFUGEES who are then entitled to protection and welfare. Why stop at the Mexican border? What about the Iraqi Christian population that s been almost completely wiped out? Why is the Pope standing on the Mexican border demanding we open the flood gates in the name of charity, while tens of thousands of Christians are being slaughtered in the Middle East?Where is the outcry from the Pope as the Catholic Charities/U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (CC/USCCB) are being paid BILLIONS to  bring mostly MUSLIM immigrants, who are being vetted by the corrupt UN to the US from the Middle East, and strategically seeding them across the United States? The following map provided by the Office of Refugee Resettlement identifies where the primary nine VOLAGs operate within America and where their affiliate sites are located:Here is the list of Charities who work with the US Department s Refugee Resettlement Program:  CWS   Church World Service  ECDC   Ethiopian Community Development Council  HIAS   Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society  IRC   International Rescue Committee  LIRS   Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services  CC/USCCB   Catholic Charities/U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops  USCRI   U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants  EMM   Episcopal Migration Ministries WRI World Relief Inc.Additionally, there are 350 subcontractors in 190 cities affiliated with the nine main refugee VOLAGs and the chart below lists the amount of money awarded by the federal government to these contractors since 2008.As you can see the amount of money that has been awarded to these non-governmental organizations is enormous with the total since 2008 amounting to over $4 billion.Simpson notes that  because they are non-governmental organizations (NGOs), they can and do lobby for advantageous changes to law and build allies in Congress and the bureaucracy, all fertilized by an open spigot of taxpayer dollars. From this point, as an American, you should be absolutely stunned at what is going on behind the scenes without your knowledge nor your input in regards to the fact that your taxpayer money along with your elected officials are undermining your security by allowing these organizations operate without any oversight. The push by fourteen Senate democrats for 65,000 refugees along with the eighty-four mayors is only the beginning though, as seventy-two House democrats have also joined this coalition.In letter on September 11, 2015, initiated by Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI.) and signed by seventy-one democrats, they urge Obama to resettle over three times the 65,000 refugees initially pushed for by the Senate democrats back in May. The House democrats cite Refugee Council USA, just as the fourteen Senators did, and  recommend that the United States resettle a minimum of 200,000 refugees by the end of 2016, including 100,000 Syrian refugees.  Neglecting the fact that the FBI has stated that they have no way of properly vetting the 2,500 Syrian refugees that we ve already accepted, it further goes to show how little these Senators, Representatives, Mayors, and VOLAGs care about the repercussions of admitting 100,000 into our country.In her book, Refugee Resettlement and the Hijra to America, Ann Corcoran explains that  Refugee resettlement has become a major money-maker for what can only be described as the  Religious Left,  whose goal is to change the demographic make-up of the 180-plus cities and towns in which they presently work.  Corcorans  statement perfectly describes exactly what is happening as push for more and more refugees comes solely from the Left. Whether it be Mayors, Senators, or Representatives in the House, they re all seeking to change the demographic make-up of the United States by forcing the taxpayers to subsidize their own destruction.WATCH ANN CORCORAN S POWERFUL VIDEO explaining how the faith-based charities are working with the US State Department to flood our nation with MULSIM refugees HERE:There is plenty of blame to go around when it comes to the willful  destruction of the greatest and most generous nation on earth.

17688,NEW FINDINGS SHOW TWO IMPORTANT Words Were Deleted From Cowardly Comey’s Remarks About Hillary That Could’ve Ended Her Presidential Bid,"The word  crooked  doesn t only apply to Hillary. Sadly, America is finding out that there are very few people in positions of power who we can trust. Perhaps the reason President Trump has so many loyal supporters is that Americans believe he s the only person in Washington with the courage and ability to actually drain the cesspool of corrupt government agencies in Washington DC Early drafts of former FBI Director James Comey s remarks about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s use of a private email server acknowledged that there was evidence she had violated a federal statute prohibiting  gross negligence,  but that phrase was deleted, according to Sen. Chuck Grassley.Grassley, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, has been investigating the formulation of Comey s controversial July 2016 remarks in which he announced that the FBI would not seek criminal charges following its probe into Clinton s use of a private email server.The Iowa Republican on Monday said the FBI had recently turned over records relating to then-Director Comey s statement. The FBI included in those documents what Grassley said appears to be a May 2, 2016 draft of Comey s exoneration statement.The draft was written two months before Comey s July 5, 2016 press conference in which he said that he did not believe Clinton had broken any laws even though she had been  extremely careless  in her handling of sensitive, highly classified material.In the draft in question, Grassley said the Comey statement included the following sentence:  There is evidence to support a conclusion that Secretary Clinton, and others, used the private email server in a manner that was grossly negligent with respect to the handling of classified material. The same draft included the following sentence:  Similarly, the sheer volume of information that was properly classified as Secret at the time it was discussed on email (that is, excluding the  up classified  emails) support an inference that the participants were grossly negligent in their handling of that information. Despite this reference to  gross negligence,  Grassley said the same draft statement goes on to determine she should not be prosecuted for a crime.Grassley asked for more details about the documents, including copies of the drafts in their original format and all records relating to discussions about why the edits were made, in a letter sent to FBI Director Christopher Wray Monday. As you are aware, 18 U.S.C. 793(f) makes the mishandling of classified material through gross negligence a criminal act,  Grassley wrote.  Although Director Comey s original version of his statement acknowledged that Secretary Clinton had violated the statute prohibiting gross negligence in the handling of classified information, he nonetheless exonerated her in that early May 2nd draft statement anyway, arguing that this part of the statute should not be enforced. Grassley said later edits,  on or around about June 10  remove those two sentences and include the following sentence instead:  Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information. Comey had the opportunity to charge a woman, who has been accused of breaking the law numerous times, with a crime, and in doing so, would have proved to all of America that nobody, even if their last name is  Clinton , is above the law. Once again, however, Crooked Hillary managed to wriggle off the hook of justice Grassley and Sen. Lindsey Graham, (R., S.C.) said in late August that Comey began drafting a statement rejecting the idea of charging Clinton with a crime over the email issue two months before Clinton was interviewed in the FBI probe. The senators released partial transcripts of interviews the Judiciary Committee conducted with U.S. officials to back up the statement.For entire story: WFB ",left-news,"Nov 7, 2017"
23175,Canada’s Immigration Website Crashes After Trump Pulls Ahead," 21st Century Wire says According to reports from Business Insider, the Canadian government s immigration website crashed tonight following reports that Donald Trump was pulling ahead in the US after calling a victory in traditional Democrat stronghold of Wisconsin.Clinton surrogate Miley Cyrus.A number of high profile US liberals had said previously that they would  leave the country  if Trump won the presidency, including actor Bryan Cranston and controversial pop singer Miley Cyrus (photo, left), both of who are staunch Hillary Clinton supporters. The barrage of celebrity Clinton campaigners threatening to leave the US helped to propel this talking point nationwide and seems to fall neatly into line with the Clinton campaign s negative fear-based campaign strategy.According to online searches, the Canadian site went down just after 10:30 pm ET on Tuesday evening followed by a surge in traffic, presumably for information on emigrating north of the border.Other key states have shocked pollsters and media  experts  in this election including strong Trump performances in Michigan, Ohio, Florida, North Carolina and Arizona.Stay up to date with all the results on the Business Insider live-blog here SEE ALSO: How to move to Canada and become a Canadian citizenREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files",Middle-east,"November 9, 2016"
466, Trump ‘Really Likes’ The Idea Of A Violent Uprising When He’s Impeached,"According to Trump ally Alex Jones, when Donald Trump is impeached all bets are off. He won t tell his supporters to accept the decision of the American people. He won t urge calm. In fact, he quite enjoys the idea of a violent uprising in his name.Recently, TMZ approached Trump ally Roger Stone in an airport and asked about impeachment. This is not 1974,  Stone said.  People will not stand for [the impeachment of President Trump]. Any politician who votes for it would be endangering their own life. There will be violence on both sides. Stone clarified that a civil war  will happen  if The Donald is impeached. I was told the president really liked Roger Stone s clip on TMZ when they confronted him in an L.A. airport saying,  We re going to impeach Trump.'  Jones said during an interview with recently pardoned criminal Joe Arpaio after the former Maricopa County sheriff  said that  people who want to take me down better watch out. Trump has never exactly shied away from violence. In fact, when people oppose him at his rallies, he quite literally tells his meth-addled fascist followers to attack them. He has even offered to pay legal fees for supporters who brutally beat black men at his events.Unfortunately for Trump s supporters, a violent uprising will not go so well for them. While they view the Left as anti-gun, many of us are well-armed and (unlike them) properly trained to defend ourselves. We just don t worship our weapons like they do.Watch the interview below:Featured image via Gerry Images (Ralph Freso)",News,"August 30, 2017"

7729, Amazing 1922 Article On Hitler Perfectly Predicts Rise Of Trump (TWEET),"A 94-year-old article from the New York Times about Adolph Hitler has gone viral, as observers have recognized shocking similarities between how the article reports on the early political years of the infamous dictator and modern reporting on Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump.The piece was unearthed by Wall Street Journal reporter Jon Ostrower, and has been shared thousands of times now by intrigued followers. The original story can also be read on the New York Times website under the headline,  New Popular Leader Rises In Bavaria. Out of curiosity, I found the first NYT reference to Adolf Hitler. Nov. 21, 1922. Amazing last three paragraphs. pic.twitter.com/VhBnlSsfNm  Jon Ostrower (@jonostrower) March 2, 2016The article starts off by noting,  This reactionary Nationalistic anti-Semitic movement has now reached a point where it is considered potentially dangerous, although not for the immediate future.  Trump s foray into presidential politics was of course greeted by derision, as both Democrats and Republicans assumed there wasn t any serious constituency for Trump s buffoonish act. But within the Republican Party, there is a clear appetite for his brand of nonsense mixed in with a heavy dose of racism and xenophobia.Taking note of the Hitler supporters who  beat up protesting Socialists and Communists  the article rings true as we are treated daily to Trump rallies where supporters have been encouraged by the candidate and his campaign goons to rough up disruptive protesters, or in some cases, perfectly quiet protesters who happened to be black.But it is the closing paragraphs of the article that have so many matching up the reporting on Hitler to Trump. It reflects a view of Hitler and Jews that through the lens of history sounds disgustingly optimistic:But several reliable, well-informed sources confirmed he idea that Hitler s anti-Semitism was not so genuine or violent as it sounded, and that he was merely using anti-Semitic propaganda as a bait to catch masses of followers and keep them aroused, enthusiastic an in line for the time when his organization is perfected and sufficiently powerful to be employed effectively for political purposes.A sophisticated politician credited Hitler with peculiar political cleverness for laying emphasis and over-emphasis on anti-Semitism, saying:  You can t expect the masses to understand or appreciate your finer real aims. You must feed the masses with cruder morsels and ideas like anti-Semitism. It would be politically all wrong to tell them the truth about where you are really leading them. We are faced with a political candidate who insists a large swath of Latinos are  rapists,  who urges registration and bans of Muslims, and who has called for the execution of black men that were falsely accused of rape. And he has already inspired acts of violence against minorities, and his most ardent supporters are often within or sympathetic to the white power movement. Trump himself refused to immediately disavow an endorsement from the Ku Klux Klan in a TV interview.It isn t a stretch to see the parallels between this historical reporting and those who insist Trump s rhetoric is just rhetoric.Featured image via Flickr",News,"March 3, 2016"
16024,TRUMP: “Let Obamacare fail… I’m not going to own it.”,"In an  impromptu  White House presser during President Trump s lunch with Vice President Pence, Trump drove home how  disappointed  he is about health care:  Let Obamacare fail, it will be a lot easier. And I think we re probably in that position where we ll just let Obamacare fail. We re not going to own it. I m not going to own it. I can tell you the Republicans are not going to own it. We ll let Obamacare fail and then the Democrats are going to come to us.  Why it matters: Trump is acknowledging defeat and now, rather than support Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s push to repeal with out a replacement bill, he s decided to let Barack Obama s Affordable Care Act remain the law of the land. fast forward and McConnell s straight repeal plan collapses with 3  no votes.  The three no votes came from three women who should really be in the D column: By Tuesday afternoon, three Republican senators   all women   had come out against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s plan to push a vote on a clean Obamacare repeal bill   enough to sink it altogether. Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) confirmed they would not vote for a repeal bill that delayed enacting the policy by two years.Susan Collins needs to go!President Trump also said he was  surprised  when Senators Moran and Lee came out as  No s  last night.  We thought they were in fairly good shape. For 7 years I ve been hearing repeal and replace  and when we finally get a chance to repeal and replace, we can t. We are winning the war on the border, we re decimating ISIS  we ve had a lot of victories but we haven t had a victory on health care. I m very disappointed. Once the Affordable Care Act fails, then everyone needs to  come together and fix it,  said Trump. Democrats have no ideas. They have no thought process. All they want to do is obstruct government and obstruct period. Obamacare isn t failing, it s failed. It s gone. ",Government News,"Jul 18, 2017"

17742,NEW STUDY Shows Why Atheists and People Who Agree With Immigrants That Bash Their Country Use LESS BRAIN POWER,"It s not at all surprising that at least 28% of Democrats consider themselves to be atheists. Fascinating This has to be embarrassing . . . if you re an atheist. A new study performed at the University of York used targeted magnetism to shut down part of the brain. The result: belief in God disappeared among more than 30 percent of participants.That in itself may not seem so embarrassing, but consider that the specific part of the brain they frazzled was the posterior medial frontal cortex the part associated with detecting and solving problems, i.e., reasoning and logic.In other words, when you shut down the part of the brain most associated with logic and reasoning, greater levels of atheism result.You ve heard the phrase,  I don t have enough faith to be an atheist ? Apparently, we can now also say,  I have too many brains to be an atheist.   The American VisionDaily Mail  The study was carried out by Dr Keise Izuma from the University of York and Colin Holbrook from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).They recruited 38 participants with an average age of 21, to take part in the study.Each of these participants said they held significant religious beliefs, and the majority held moderate to extremely conservative political beliefs.Political views were important because it suggested they were more likely to have stronger viewpoints on immigration.Half of these participants formed part of a control group and received a low-level  sham  procedure that did not affect their brains.The other half received enough energy through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to lower activity in the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC).This part of the brain, located near the surface and roughly a few inches up from the forehead, is associated with detecting problems and triggering responses that address them.Following the treatment, all the participants were first asked to think about death before being asked questions about their religious beliefs and their feelings about immigrants.The death task including writing brief responses on the subject of their own death.To address their levels of prejudice, participants were asked to read two essays   one critical and one positive   written by an immigrant from Latin America about the US.After reading each essay, participants rated how much they liked the person who wrote the essay and how much they agreed with their views.Religious belief was measured using a version of the Supernatural Belief Scale.Items were presented in random order and rated according to the same scale used in the immigrant ratings.Questions included:  There exists an all-powerful, all-knowing, loving God ,  There exist good personal spiritual beings, whom we might call angels  and  There exists an evil personal spiritual being, whom we might call the Devil. Circa   So how do Democrats and Republicans stack up when it comes to having faith vs. athesists?According to the Pew Research Center,  nones    people who don t identify with any religion   make up 23 percent of American adults.In the Democratic Party, that number is even bigger. 28 percent of Democrats are non-religious, Pew s research shows.Conversely, people who identify as non-religious are much more likely to vote Democratic. 70 percent of self-identifying atheists, for example, voted for President Obama in 2012, according to Pew.One of those atheists is James White, a Texas delegate for Hillary Clinton at this year s DNC. At the convention on Monday, White was wearing a shirt that read,  I m actually an atheist. White said he still feels it s necessary to publicly broadcast his beliefs to promote acceptance of atheism within the party. When we make it safe for people to realize that a nearly 60-year-old Texas middle-aged white guy is an atheist and a Democrat, those things make it easier for others to come forward too,  he said. There has been some progress, White said. Earlier this year, the Texas Democratic Party adopted three secular resolutions into its official policy platform.The investigators additionally found that the magnetic stimulation had the greatest effect on reactions to the critical author in the essay test. We think that hearing criticisms of your group s values, perhaps especially from a person you perceive as an outsider, is processed as an ideological sort of threat,  said Dr Izuma. One way to respond to such threats is to  double down  on your group values, increasing your investment in them, and reacting more negatively to the critic,  he continued. When we disrupted the brain region that usually helps detect and respond to threats, we saw a less negative, less ideologically motivated reaction to the critical author and his opinions.

7551, Obama Shows How He’s Going To Destroy Trump This Fall And It’s Hilarious,"President Obama is widely expected to be an extremely valuable asset for the Democratic Party in this November s general election, and he gave a preview of just how he d rip Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to shreds at a campaign event on Friday night.Speaking to Democrats in Austin, Texas, President Obama talked about Trump s ridiculous Trump steaks show and tell session, noting that there s  a debate inside of the other party that is fantasy, and school yard taunts, and sellin  stuff like it s the home shopping network. Obama also mocked the Republican establishment for claiming they are surprised by the hate that Trump has whipped up. From the White House pool report:Obama also again mocked establishment Republicans, who he argues say We re shocked someone is fanning anti-immigrant or anti-muslim sentiment!   We re shocked!. We re shocked that someone could be loose with the facts. Or distort someone s record. Shocked! How could you be shocked? This was the guy who was sure I was born in Kenya. And wasn t letting go   As long as it was being directed at me they were fine with it. It was a hoot   and suddenly they re shocked! That gamblings going on in this establishment,  he said.Obama said Donald Trump is  A distillation of what has been going on in their party for more than a decade   this is the message that s been fed   that you just deny the evidence of science. That compromise is a betrayal. That the other side isn t simply wrong, we disagree   the other side is destroying the country. Or treasonous. Look it up, that s what they ve been saying. So they can t be surprised when somebody says,  I can make up stuff better than that.' As other Democrats have made clear, Obama said the right had to own what is happening in Trump s campaign:  The reaction is something they have to take responsibility for and then make an adjustment. It is clear that Obama will be out on the trail, making sure that a campaign of hate does not usher in his successor.

8483," If You Love Veterans So Much, Trump, Why Did You Try To Sweep Them Into The Gutter?","According to Donald Trump, he loves veterans. At least that s what he keeps telling people. And when you re running in an election for a party that constantly uses the service of men and women and uniform as political props, you re going to tout the line that you love veterans as much as possible. However, actions speak louder than words, and Trump apparently doesn t realize that people actually remember the actions he took back in 1991 when he tried to remove veterans from 5th Avenue in New York City. You see, Trump Tower is on 5th Avenue, and those gosh darn veterans trying to make a living as vendors were just too unsightly for Trump to have anywhere near his precious building.In a letter Trump wrote to the New York state Assembly in 1991, it said: While disabled veterans should be given every opportunity to earn a living, is it fair to do so to the detriment of the city as a whole or its tax paying citizens and businesses? Do we allow Fifth Avenue, one of the world s finest and most luxurious shopping districts, to be turned into an outdoor flea market, clogging and seriously downgrading the area? And then again to NYC Mayor Mike Bloomberg in 2004: Whether they are veterans or not, they [the vendors] should not be allowed to sell on this most important and prestigious shopping street he image of New York City will suffer  I hope you can stop this very deplorable situation before it is too late. And in case that s not bad enough for you, he also wanted to make sure no one sat down near his building that may have taken away from the  beautiful ambience.  According to the New York Times he had large planters placed on benches. He said in 1984: We have had tremendous difficulties with respect to the bench   drug addicts, vagrants, et cetera have come to the atrium in large numbers. Additionally, all sorts of  horrors  had been taking place that effectively ruined the beautiful ambience of the space which everyone loves so much. To be blunt, Donald Trump is exactly what s wrong with the United States of America, and for him to even remotely be coming close to gaining the Republican nomination for president is outright horrifying. He only loves veterans when it s politically convenient for him to do so. To pander to a bunch of folks who are apparently so dumb to think he would actually make a decent president. His actions in the past with veterans only prove the continuing line that Trump is only out for himself and what s best for Trump. He doesn t want America to be great, because guess what, America is already pretty damn great. Trump wants Trump to be great, and he wants to stroke his ego inside the Oval Office. Smart Americans know better, and we need to make sure he stays as far away from the White House as possible.Featured image: Flickr/Wikimedia/photoshop",News,"January 28, 2016"

4954, Trump’s Newest Foreign Policy Advisor Is One Of The Dumbest People To Ever Serve In Congress,"If you weren t having nightmares before about Donald Trump potentially having the nuclear codes, his latest choice for national security advisor should keep you up for months, or at least until November 9th. He has chosen, as a national security advisor, a woman who believes the earth is six million years old and that the world is ending very, very soon anyway. That woman is the former Congresswoman from Minnesota, Michele Bachmann.The campaign hasn t yet confirmed that Bachmann is advising on matters of foreign policy, but she is advising him on evangelical matters and she was, in a bit of tragic irony, part of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence when she was still in Congress. To some who have no idea about anything outside the borders of our country (Donald Trump), it would be logical to believe that she s an expert on foreign policy. She s not.As for her reputed position as a foreign policy advisor on Trump s team, Bachmann says this:The former Minnesota congresswoman attended a fundraiser in the state for Trump on Saturday, where she revealed to the press that she has his ear on foreign policy. He also recognizes there is a threat around the world, not just here in Minnesota, of radical Islam,  she said, according to MPR News.  I wish our President Obama also understood the threat of radical Islam and took it seriously. He s a common-sense guy, not into political correctness,  Bachmann added, according to the Star Tribune.Source: The HillLet s forget for a moment that Bachmann is a disaster on social issues. She hates gay people. She thinks the Founding Fathers outlawed slavery. She is anti-science. She s an anti-government conspiracy theorist. She thinks half of all African-American pregnancies end in abortion. She thinks that there would be no unemployment if there were no minimum wage. She thinks the U.S. is running out of rich people.As for her foreign expertise, she believes that the United States wants some sort of global currency. She believes Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. That would be Tel Aviv. She believes Sharia Law is around every corner. More significantly, she believes that there s no point in making the world a better place because Jesus will come vacuum everyone up to Heaven within the very near future. We know that there is more prophecy of Jesus  second coming even than there was in the first,  she said.  We also should be encouraged and empowered as believers in Jesus Christ   now more than ever   with the Bible in one hand, the newspaper in another, to say to our neighbors and co-workers and people at church, this is about the Lord speaking to the world that,  I am coming soon.

21987,Henningsen: Obama White House Colluded with Facebook to Fabricate ‘Russian Bot’ Conspiracy,"WASHINGTON DC   This week the Senate Intelligence Committee finally gave an update on its continuing investigation into whether Russia actually had anything to do with the 2016 Election. If anyone was expecting any actual evidence to be presented, they would have been sorely disappointed, again. Still, that s not going to stop Official Washington from burning though more public money to try and prove a conspiracy theory.  The issue of collusion is still open,  said committee chairman, Richard Burr of North Carolina (R).  We have more work to do as it relates to collusion, but we re developing a clearer picture of what happened. Likewise, the committee s ranking Democrat, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, admitted they had nothing, but implored Americans to  be on guard of the Russian. The Russian active measures did not end on Election Day 2016,  said Warner. He maintains that the US should adopt a  more aggressive  whole government  approach  to combat Russian influence on the vulnerable minds of unsuspecting Americans.However, yesterday 21WIRE revealed via Consortium News   that it was Senator Warner, along with the Obama White House, who colluded with Silicon Valley giant Facebook in 2016, with Warner making multiple trips to Palo Alto to pressure Facebook to produce some  evidence  that Warner and his colleagues could hold up as proof of  Russian Bots  using Facebook to interfere in the 2016 Election. As it turns out, this was fake news fabricated by Washington and its mainstream media partners.21WIRE editor Patrick Henningsen spoke to RT International yesterday about these developments, and how the US government is using their own fake news in order to shut down competition in the information sphere.

23302,US-UK DIRTY WAR: ‘Latin American-style’ Death Squads in Iraq Revealed Through Chilcot," Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireThis week another toxic revelation dripped from the Chilcot Report.According to top British SAS officers, US commander Stanley McChrystal s counter-insurgency  black-ops  featured a program of relentless violence designed to  speed up  the process of political cleansing and the so-called  reconstruction  of Iraq.What is so interesting here, is the Chilcot s choice of language, including the term  Latin American-style death squads , which by default implies the United States government was party to war crimes in Central America during the 1980 s   a claim which has always been strenuously denied in public, even though the general public and academia recognizes this to be a self-evident fact of America s long-running ugly history of intervention in that region.The Independent report reveals the level of sheer depravity by US command: The mission was an extraordinary set-up: inside the command centre    The Machine    was the  Death Star , on the walls of which were banks of television screens,  Kill TV , running live pictures of action taking place and surveillance footage in real time from which suspects could be picked out for future arrest or elimination. The Independent also detailed how reckless and violent practices by the US military caused noticeable divisions and splits between joint US-UK command structures and operations, including political tension between British military command.Through the newly created  Office of Special Plans , neoconservatives Paul Wolfowitz and Douglas Feith rolled out their own sub-layer to the US controlled shadow government in Iraq, including the establishment of the  Iraqi De Baathification Council  which, under the supervision of then US Viceroy Paul Bremer, began dismantling the Iraqi military, security and intelligence agency infrastructures of President Saddam Hussein. And so began the process of the Pentagon s  de-Baathification  process in Iraq, immediately followed by a hive of violent  Gangs and Counter-gangs  created by the US and UK covert military and intelligence apparatuses. Front and center in this effort were US operatives John Negroponte and his understudy at the time, Robert Ford, who was later dispatched as US Ambassador to Syria in the run-up to the Syrian Conflict which began in 2011.The legacy of this destructive policy still lingers in Iraq and now in Syria. This unquestionably spawned ISIS and many other terrorist factions in both Iraq and Syria. Only last week, Iraq saw its most deadly car bomb ever, a questionable  sectarian attack  (a narrative not challenged by the western and international press) which killed 200 innocent civilians, and injured many more. GLADIO REDUX: A map of every car bomb in Baghdad since the US-UK invasion in 2003 (Source: Twitter)Prof Michel Chossudovsky explains this same highly disturbing pattern that generally follows every US intervention overseas, be it overt or covert: The recruitment of death squads is part of a well established US military-intelligence agenda. There is a long and gruesome US history of covert funding and support of  terror brigades and targeted assassinations going back to the Vietnam war.   As government forces continue to confront the self-proclaimed  Free Syrian Army  (FSA),  the historical roots of  the West s covert war on Syria  which has resulted in countless atrocities  must be fully revealed.  Once again, we can see the revelation of the US-UK method of not simply instigating wars, but facilitating dirty wars not only overseas, but also at home, as in the case of Operation GLADIO and numerous other false flag events admittedly staged in North America.As 21WIRE will demonstrate in subsequent reports, this latest Chilcot revelation is only the tip of a much larger, covert iceberg RTHowever, kill or capture operations in and around Baghdad, launched from the Balad base 50 miles (80km) north of the city, were a key if little known chapter in Britain s shadow war, the Independent reports.Despite killing or taking as prisoner up to 3,500 insurgents, the mission against the Sunni insurgency caused deep rifts to the point where a senior commander, himself ex-SAS, demanded to know why the UK Special Forces were  helping to run Latin American-style death squads? The mission, under now-famed US General Stanley McChrystal, involved a shift from searching for apparently non-existent weapons of mass destruction (WMD) to man-hunting.Antagonism over the tactics led to UK troops being banned from some operations and a UK SAS commander lodging a complaint with US authorities for talking about British involvement in operations. Another SAS colonel was also ostracized from his regiment after serving under McCrystal.Chilcot does sketch out some of the details of the growing rift, though his report appears to leave out direct references to Special Forces operations. US and UK strategies had, in effect, been on different courses since the UK decision to focus its attention on MND (SE) [Multi-National Division South East, the British run zone] in 2003.As result of this decision, the UK had acquired distinctly different priorities from the US,  the 2.6-million-word report argues.It says the UK was then only  marginally involved in the central tasks of stabilizing the Iraqi government in Baghdad and managing sectarian divisions, while it had come to see its main task in Basra as one of keeping the situation calm while building the case for withdrawal. From that point on, it appears, the US became increasingly concerned that a wavering UK was chiefly focused on getting out of the unpopular war in the best order it could and as soon as possible.In 2006, a former SAS soldier blew the whistle on some of the tactics used in and around Baghdad. Ben Griffin was later gagged by the UK courts for talking about his experiences, but before he was silenced told the Telegraph,  The Americans had this catch-all approach to lifting suspects. The tactics were draconian and completely ineffective. The Americans were doing things like chucking farmers into Abu Ghraib [the notorious prison in Baghdad where US troops abused and tortured Iraqi detainees] or handing them over to the Iraqi authorities, knowing full well they were going to be tortured,  he said at the time.It may be of note that the SAS commander s reference to  Latin American-style deaths squads  appears to ignore the fact that at time of the Iraq war, in July 2003, the UK was itself stepping up training of Colombian paramilitary forces.Commenting on the revelations at the time, human rights NGO Amnesty International warned  the Colombian government has not implemented the UN human rights recommendations and military assistance only gives a green light to the army to carry on as before.

Oh yeah it called Extortion:ex tor tion ik st rSH( )n/ noun the practice of obtaining something, especially money, through force or threats. synonyms: blackmail, shakedown; formalexaction  arrested on a charge of extortion  Unhappy with a series of small concessions from the administration, protesters at Yale University have released a new list of demands that include firing people they don t like and giving their favored programs a budget increase of at least $8 million a year.The new demands, released by a group calling itself Next Yale, were read aloud to Yale president Peter Salovey Thursday night by protesters who marched to his front door at midnight. The group says the demands are necessary to  reduce the intolerable racism that students of color experience on campus every day.  Salovey is given until Nov. 18 to respond.As evidence of Yale s hostile racial climate, the demands cite a widely debunked alleged exclusion of black women from a party hosted at Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) fraternity. There is substantial evidence this alleged segregation did not happen.Of the Yale student s demands, the most expensive is the third, which orders the school to increase the budget for Yale s four cultural centers (for Asians, blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians) by two million dollars each, a total expense of $8 million. Along with this increase to their budgets, the students demand that the cultural centers hire five additional full-time employees each. Via: Daily Caller ",politics,"Nov 14, 2015"

Certainly not the legal citizens of America!After Obama allowed and even encouraged thousands upon thousands of unaccompanied illegal alien minors to flood America, we re now responsible for the mess he created.  MS13 gang members have been going on killing sprees that have been terrorizing Americans. President Trump has a policy in place that simply enforces the law! Read below and let us know if you agree that the ACLU is protecting people who should have no rights in America.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed a class action lawsuit against President Trump s administration over the detention of immigrant teenagers for  unsubstantiated claims of gang affiliation. The lawsuit, announced on Friday, targets Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Department of Health and Human Services  Office of Refugee Resettlement.In a press release, the ACLU accuses ICE and the Office of Refugee Resettlement of detaining children and transporting them to detention facilities without notifying their parents or lawyers.The organization also alleges that ICE is detaining and deporting the immigrant teens  under the guise of a  crackdown  on transnational street gangs  and accuses the federal agency of making arrests based on  unreliable claims of gang affiliation and flawed reports of criminal history.   We re talking about teens who were picked up for play-fighting with a friend, or for showing pride in their home country of El Salvador,  Stephen Kang, an attorney with the ACLU Immigrants  Rights Project, said in the release.  The Office of Refugee Resettlement is accepting wholesale that young immigrants should be kept behind bars because of what they look like or where they come from. The lead plaintiffs in the case are from Suffolk County in Long Island, N.Y.In May, ICE announced it has arrested more than 1,300 people in a crackdown on gangs. Three of those arrested had Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals paperwork protecting them from deportation, according to a report at the time by The Washington Post.The crackdown on gangs coupled with the Trump administration s tough stance on legal and illegal immigration has raised alarms among activists that people with tenuous connections to gangs could come under unfair scrutiny.Fox News reported a surge in people seeking to remove tattoos that people believed could be used by ICE to link them to gangs.The ACLU class action lawsuit seeks the release of the teens who are the plaintiffs in the case as well as an injunction to prevent the government from further detaining immigrant children without cause.The ACLU has launched numerous lawsuits against Trump s administration since he took office, suing over Trump s travel ban and challenging the legality of his voter fraud commission.WHO IS THE ACLU PROTECTING?

Executives from Estee Lauder got face time with Clinton once they donated millions to the Clinton Foundation. The left is trying to say that you can t prove a connection but anyone with half a brain would be able to put two and two together. The Prince of Bahrain tried repeatedly to meet with Hillary Clinton but only after donating $32 million to the Clinton Foundation did he get a meeting.Est e Lauder executive Nancy Mahon was appointed to a government council and received special government employee status after donating to the Clinton Foundation while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state.Executives at Est e Lauder were among those who got face time with Secretary Clinton after they donated to the Clinton Foundation, according to an AP report. However, Nancy Mahon not only met with Clinton, she also was appointed to a government position after a fund she helped run pledged millions to the Foundation in 2008.Mahon is a senior vice president at Est e Lauder and the global executive director of the MAC AIDS Fund, the cosmetics company s charitable arm. Through the fund, she pledged a commitment to the Clinton Global Initiative in 2008. The MAC AIDS Fund ultimately donated between $1 and $5 million to the Clinton Foundation.Mahon was appointed to the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS and elevated to chairperson in December 2011, after launching a public-private partnership with the State Department in June.Clinton thanked  all our friends  at MAC when announcing the partnership to combat gender-based violence in South Africa on June 2, 2011.

4740, Trump Threw Mar-A-Lago Fundraiser For Woman At The Center Of Bribery Scandal,"Just a few days after she made the decision to let an investigation of Donald Trump s Trump University slide, the former reality TV star held a fundraiser for Florida attorney general Pam Bondi at his palatial Mar-A-Lago compound.News of the cash-fueled party comes as Trump faces renewed criticism after being fined by the IRS after it came to light that the Trump Foundation illegally funneled money into Bondi s re-election campaign.In March 2014, Donald Trump opened his 126-room Palm Beach resort, Mar-a-Lago, for a $3,000-per-person fundraiser for Pam Bondi. The Florida attorney general, who was facing a tough re-election campaign, had recently decided not to investigate Trump University.Trump did not write a check to the attorney general that night. The previous fall, his personal foundation had given $25,000 to a pro-Bondi PAC. But by hosting her fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago and bringing in some of his own star power, Trump provided Bondi s campaign with a nice financial boost.The Huffington Post also reports that while Trump has billed the RNC $140,000 per event to use his mansion, he only charged the Republican Party of Florida $4,855.65. That means that Trump stands to make a windfall simply by controlling the flow of campaign donor money to his own enterprises.News of the interlocking relationship between Trump and Bondi (she has done campaign rallies for him) underscores how the national media has ignored or played down actual stories of Trump and his involvement with corruption. Instead they have banged the drums on the Clinton Foundation, making allegations of wrong-doing based on the potential and  optics  of the far-reaching charity the Clintons put in place.Trump is also implicated in similar behavior in Texas. The attorney general there dropped looking into Trump University a little after he gave him a financial donation.Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 7, 2016"

Republicans are demanding more controls so Rubio is calling them stingy with federal dollars. Is this guy really a Republican? Just two months after running as one of the conservative candidates in the GOP presidential race, Sen. Marco Rubio is now embracing Democrats  calls to open the federal checkbook and dole out billions of dollars in money to combat the Zika virus   and tacking it onto the debt.Mr. Rubio, whose home state of Florida is at risk of a serious outbreak, is co-sponsoring legislation to fully fund President Obama s nearly $2 billion emergency spending request, and blasted his fellow Republicans for being too stingy by demanding more proof and more controls.And Mr. Rubio, who is finishing out his first term then ditching the Senate at the end of this year, said if the new spending can be offset, that s fine. But he s also fine with tacking it onto the debt and leaving it for others to pay for.  In times of public health emergencies, just like natural disasters, we shouldn t delay acting while we figure out and try to agree on what we re going to cut from other parts of the budget,  he said in a floor speech last week.Mr. Rubio gives Democrats political cover as Congress prepares to fight this week over the mosquito-borne Zika virus, which health experts say hasn t had a breakout in the U.S. yet, but fear one is looming as the summer heats up.The House GOP released its own plan Monday that would allocate $622 million toward Zika, taking the money from existing Ebola money and elsewhere.Read more: WT",politics,"May 16, 2016"
1288, Ben & Jerry Tell Us Why Pulling Out Of Paris Climate Deal Was The Right Move,"Ben and Jerry, the  ber liberal Vermont ice cream guys, are no fans of Donald Trump and in a blistering and sarcastic op-ed, they sarcastically explained how pulling out of the Paris climate treaty was the right thing to do.The op-ed, on their website, is tongue-in-cheek, but also bitter (a terrible suggestion for a Ben & Jerry s flavor). They talk about the jobs that will be lost:We hear China is ramping up their renewable energy production and it sure looks like a lot of work. Beijing alone plans to invest $360 billion in renewables by 2020, creating more than 13 million jobs. But jobs are work! Work is hard! It s so much easier to luxuriate in the status quo, driving our fossil-fuel-powered cars and enjoying our coal-created electricity like we always have.It s also quite personal for them. The cost of cocoa beans and vanilla will rise dramatically over the coming years.Then, there s the fact that we are one of only three countries who have chosen not to participate. That means we will no longer have a seat at the table and it means that for all intents and purposes, we can no longer call ourselves a superpower.Ben & Jerry go on to talk about the wonderful ocean views we ll all soon have:Who doesn t love oceanfront property? With runaway climate change melting glaciers and causing sea levels to rise at unprecedented rates, a whole lot more of us could be seeing waves from our bedroom windows. Sure, some folks might lose their homes and businesses, and our coastal cities could see devastating changes, but a whole lot of people will also be able to learn how to surf right in their backyards. Sounds like a fair tradeoff to us.They also look forward to the impending world crises, which make  life exciting.

9826,WILL AND GRACE Writers Explain How Their HATE For PRESIDENT TRUMP Inspired Them To Bring Show Back After 11 Years [VIDEO],"When Will & Grace creators David Kohan and Max Mutchnick reunited the stars of the NBC comedy in fall 2016, more than 10 years after its finale, a reboot was not on their minds.  There was not one word about,  Let s figure out a way to do this again!    insists Kohan, 53. The pair were so sure that the project   a video in support of then-candidate Hillary Clinton   would be their last with the gang that they hired a film crew  as a way to memorialize the event for our daughters,  explains Mutchnick, 51.But NBC Entertainment chairman Bob Greenblatt had other plans. Less than two weeks later, the creators were back at the NBC commissary discussing a revival. The multicam returns Thursday, Sept. 28, for season nine, with a tenth season already greenlighted.Picking up  11 years later,  as the season premiere title suggests, the new episodes will largely ignore the events of the series finale, in which Will (Eric McCormack) and Grace (Debra Messing) both married, had kids and went their separate ways. Instead, the two are single and living together, still, with Jack (Sean Hayes) across the hall and Karen (Megan Mullally) just as rich and outrageous as ever.The other big change since the foursome last graced the small screen? The new president in the White House   despite Kohan and Mutchnick s best efforts on Clinton s behalf.  There s a lot of tension in the air, so there s a lot of things to write and there are a lot of reasons to make an audience laugh,  Mutchnick says.  THR3 weeks before the election, Will and Grace s writers produced a video using the cast the show s former cast to beg liberal viewers to vote for Hillary. The entire 9 minute and 37-second video was created for the sole purpose of trashing then-candidate President Trump. David Kohan From Bob Greenblatt were so inspired by the number of Trump-hating liberals who viewed their video received, that they decided to start the series back up again.The video includes classy lines from Will about then-candidate Trump being a  dick .

6020, Here’s The Latest Reason Conservatives Are Calling Michelle Obama A N***** (SCREENSHOTS),"It s official: No one in the Obama family can do or say anything without the Stupid Part of America calling them n*ggers. As she gave her final, powerful commencement speech as First Lady, Michelle Obama dropped a harsh truth on the graduating class of CUNY   the White House was built largely using slave labor: It s the story that I witness every single day, when I wake up in a house that was built by slaves. And I watch my daughters two beautiful, black young women head off to school waving goodbye to their father, the President of the United States, the son of a man from Kenya who came here to American to America for the same reasons as many of you: To get an education and improve his prospects in life. Obama is correct. WhiteHousehistory.org notes that black people provided much of the labor that went into building the White House after the U.S. government failed to find qualified workers they could pay to do the work (slave masters were, of course, paid):The D.C. commissioners, charged by Congress with building the new city under the direction of the president, initially planned to import workers from Europe to meet their labor needs. However, response to recruitment was dismal and soon they turned to African American enslaved and free to provide the bulk of labor that built the White House, the United States Capitol, and other early government buildings.Stonemason Collen Williamson trained enslaved people on the spot at the government s quarry at Aquia, Virginia. Enslaved people quarried and cut the rough stone that was later dressed and laid by Scottish masons to erect the walls of the President s House. The slaves joined a work force that included local white laborers and artisans from Maryland and Virginia, as well as immigrants from Ireland, Scotland, and other European nations.The uneducated f*ckwits at Young Conservatives, naturally, complained that the First Lady  whined  about that little slavery issue that we should pretend never happened, calling her  ungrateful  and informing their readers that Obama is  ungrateful  because she correctly noted the history of her current home. You know, Michelle   if you don t like living there, move out,  writes blogger John. S. Roberts, who wonders why  some people  (read:  the blacks ) just  can t move beyond  the fact that their ancestors were owned by white people.Naturally, commenters agreed, calling the First Lady a  n*gger  because that s pretty much the extent of their intelligence. They, too, think she is  ungrateful  because white people did her a favor by shipping her ancestors over here and forcing them to work and endure brutal beatings, rapes, and murders:         Over at right-wing propaganda mill, Weazel Zippers, the sentiment was the same   and they didn t need to write a single word. They just pasted a screenshot of a tweet about the statement.              Conservatives are horrible   and, unfortunately, each and every single one of them will be headed to the polls in November to vote for Trump. We can not allow someone who fosters this sort of hatred to succeed President Obama. Be sure to get out and do your duty in November   vote BLUE across the board and kick the haters out of their respective offices.Featured image via screen capture",News,"June 4, 2016"
2595, Obama’s Attorney General Just Spit In Trump’s Face Over 9th Circuit Court Ruling,"With the 9th Circuit Court ruling against the Trump administration and in favor of Washington State, Minnesota, and by proxy everyone else that was harmed by his Muslim ban, we have the inevitable rage-fest from Trump, along with people who are spitting in his face and stomping on his pride because they agree with the courts.One of the people who probably agrees with how the courts have been ruling is Sally Yates, the acting attorney general that Trump fired because she refused to enforce the ban. Trump didn t just quietly let her go, though. He accused her of betraying her department, and implied that she d betrayed the U.S.Now, enter Eric Holder. He was Obama s attorney general before Loretta Lynch, and spearheaded Department of Justice investigations into controversial things, such as whether the police department in Ferguson, Missouri was guilty of racial profiling, among other things. Holder, of course, also seems to believe that Trump s Muslim ban was a bad idea.So he, too, is rubbing the 9th Circuit s decision in Trump s face because, surprise surprise, Yates was vindicated in her decision to refuse to enforce the Muslim ban.

7917, Trump Explodes At Smiling Protester: ‘I’d Like To Punch Him In The Face’ (VIDEO),"A few weeks ago, Rachel Maddow did a comparison of Donald Trump and notorious racist George Wallace on her show. One of the points she made about the 2016 candidate and the 1968 candidate is how violent they both are. Like George Wallace, Trump is able to get his crowds riled up into such a frenzy that they start attacking protesters. At the beginning of his campaign, The Donald would do it by screeching  GET HIM OUTTA HERE,  but during a recent event, he actually said he d like to punch a protester in the face.During a campaign event in Nevada on Monday night, Trump flipped out after he was interrupted by some hecklers and said: You know what I hate? There s a guy, totally disruptive, throwing punches   we re not allowed to punch back anymore. In the old days, you know what they used to do with guys like that when they were in a place like this? They d be carried out on a stretcher, folks. Yeah, that imbecile thinks that protesting at one of his events warrants being  carried out on a stretcher.  But he wasn t finished. When one of the protesters was removed by security, the man was smiling and this really pissed Trump off, he said, I d like to punch him in the face, I ll tell you that. There s a guy throwing punches, nasty as hell, screaming and everything else when we re talking, and we re talking out   we re not allowed, the guards are very gentle with him, he s walking, like, big high fives, smiling, laughing   I d like to punch him in the face. According to Politico security admitted that nobody was  throwing punches.  Instead, it looks like Trump made that up to justify his violent words. This is, of course, not surprising coming from a man who once applauded his supporters for kicking and punching a Black Lives Matter protester. It is, however, frightening that this man is in first place in the GOP polls. A man who stands on a stage and incites violence. A man who that is how a president should behave. This is what the Republican Party is offering up to the country: a schoolyard bully. Seriously?

22755,Reflections on a World Gone Mad and Pushing Back against Neocolonialist Thuggery," Andre Vltchek Anti DiplomaticoThe following is an interview with ANDRE VLTCHEK by ALESSANDRO BIANCCHI, Chief Editor of the Italian political magazine Anti-Diplomatico:ALESSANDRO BIANCHI: Self-determination of peoples and respect for the borders and sovereignty of a country. This is of the most complicated issue for international law. How can it be articulated for the case of Catalonia?ANDRE VLTCHEK: Personally, I m not very enthusiastic about smaller nations forming their own states, particularly those in the West, where they would, after gaining  independence , remain in the alliances that are oppressing and plundering the entire world: like NATO or the European Union.Clearly, the breaking of the great country of Yugoslavia into small pieces was a hostile, evil design by the West, and particularly of Germany and Austria. The dissolution of Czechoslovakia after the so-called  Velvet Revolution  was a total idiocy.But Catalonia (or Basque Country), if it became independent, would become one of the richest parts of Europe. I don t think it would have any great positive or negative impact on the rest of the world. As an internationalist, I don t really care if they are separate from Spain or not, or whether they are even richer than they already are, as I care much more about what is happening in places such as Afghanistan, Venezuela or North Korea.On the other hand, the way Spain has now behaved in Catalonia, after the referendum, is a total disgrace. They decided to treat the Catalan people in the same way as Indonesians have been treating Papuans for decades. If this continues, it will all reach the point of no return: reconciliation will become impossible. You cannot start sexually harassing women and then break their fingers, one by one, just because they want to have their own state. You cannot injure hundreds of innocent people, who simply don t want to be governed from Madrid. That s absurd and thoroughly sick! Of course Spain used to commit holocausts all over what is now called Latin America, so it is  in their blood . But I don t think Catalans will allow this to be done to them.What about the constitution of Spain? Look, there should be nothing sacred about constitutions. In the West, they were written to protect the interests of the ruling classes. When they get outdated, they should be moderated, or totally rewritten. If Catalans or Basques want their independence, if they really want it, if it is so important for them, then why not   they should have it. Spain is not a  people s country . It is an oppressive Western bully. I would have a totally different position if some part of Bolivia or China were to try to secede.AB: Different situation and different reality. Another issue of fundamental international concern in this period is the referendum of Iraqi Kurdistan, which is likely to become the new fuse ready to explode in that area. Would it be the new Israel in the Middle East as someone has affirmed?AV: Well, that is really a very serious issue. I have worked in the Kurdish autonomous region of Iraq already twice, even on the  border  with Mosul, and what I saw there I did not like at all!It is clearly a  client  state of the West, of Turkey and to some extent, Israel. It is shamelessly capitalist, taking land from its own people, cheating them, just in order to pump and refine huge quantities of oil. It treats Syrian refugees like animals, forcing them to make anti-Assad statements. It is turning ancient Erbil into some bizarre shopping mall with nothing public in sight. Its military top brass is mainly US/UK-trained and indoctrinated. And it provokes Baghdad, day and night.I really strongly disliked what I saw there. If Iraqi Kurds were allowed to have their  independence , the impact on the region would be huge and certainly negative. Baghdad should not allow it, even at the cost of an armed confrontation.AB: Coming to the question of the moment: the nuclear escalation in North Korean and a possible escalation of war on the Korean peninsula. What is your opinion about Kim s strategy and what are the real risks?AV: There is only one real  risk  and danger: that the world is quickly accepting as inevitable the fact that the Western thuggish regimes can get away with absolutely anything. I see no other serious problem that the world today is facing.What is Kim s strategy? To defend his people by all means, against the brutal force that has already murdered millions of men, women and children of Korea. That brutal force is the West and its allies. It is all very simple, but only if one is willing to turn off the BBC and to use his or her own brain, it becomes  obvious .AB: According to many, for Pyongyang the nuclear bomb is becoming more and more vital because it is increasingly feared that the country will end up like Iraq and Libya. Do you not believe that the sanctions of the United Nations are therefore totally ineffective and counterproductive because they fuel this escalation?AV: Of course, but they [sanctions] are still imposed on the victim! It is because almost no one dares to laugh straight in the faces of Western demagogues and dictators. The world resembles the areas occupied by the Nazi Germany and Italy and Japan during the WWII. There, nobody would dare to vote independently, defending victims of fascism.AB: The US Federation of Science (FAS) estimates that in 2017 North Korea has  fissile material to potentially produce 10 to 20 nuclear warheads  even if it is strongly suspected that none can be considered ready for launch. The US possesses 6,800 nuclear heads. The French and British (respectively 300 and 215 respectively) included, NATO s nuclear forces have 7,315 nuclear warheads, of which 2,200 are ready to launch, compared to 7,000 held by the Russians, of which 1,950 are ready to launch. With Chinese (270), Pakistani (120-130), Indian (110-120) and Israeli (80), the total number of nuclear warheads is estimated to be around 15,000 by default. The West is a nuclear oligopoly that can only create an escalation with those who feel threatened, and so the threatened search to procure them. Is North Korea the only source of nuclear threat to the world, as it seems in the mainstream media?AV: Of course, North Korea is no threat at all. I have already spoken about it during countless televised interviews. I visited North Korea and mingled with its people. There, nobody wants war. The North Korean people paid a terrible price for their independence. Its civilians were murdered mercilessly in tunnels by Western forces; its women were brutally raped, entire villages and towns leveled to the ground, or burned to ashes. All this is never discussed in the West, but is remembered in North Korea.Now, absolutely shameless British propaganda is  preparing  the world public for the  inevitability  of the war. You know, if someone in this day and age still believes that the United States is the only culprit, he or she is perhaps living in some deep isolated trench or a cave. Indoctrination and brainwashing is mainly designed,  Made in Europe , most evidently in the UK, where most of the people have already lost all their ability to think rationally. The British colonialist propaganda apparatus is terribly sinister, but strategically it is simply brilliant! It was utilized for centuries, and it even succeeded in  programming  the brains of the victims in the sub-Continent, Africa and elsewhere.Of course, your numbers are correct and all that is happening is thoroughly absurd! But day and night people are told that North Korea represents a true danger to the world. The same was said about the Soviet Union, China, Cuba, Iraq, Afghanistan and many other countries. Most of these countries have already been destroyed.North Korea s sin is that it refuses to surrender, to fall on its knees, to sacrifice its people. It refuses to become a slave. For centuries, European and later US colonialism punished such defiance in the most brutal ways. Western culture is, after all, based and built on slavery. It demands absolute compliance, unconditional submission.If North Korea is attacked, it should fight back! And it will.AB: The United Nations adopted the important Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in July. The United Nations is often used (in alternate ways and countries): this Treaty is ignored by all nuclear powers, including by members of NATO with US nuclear weapons (including Italy). NATO has banned member states from ratifying it. Can the West have a moralist attitude to those who pursue a deterrent in order not to not end up like Saddam and Gaddafi?AV: The West is like an army of brigands that has managed to overrun some city, to rape everything that moves, burn the center, loot houses and shops and then execute all leading thinkers and defenders. A few days later they see someone stealing a bunch of bananas from a fruit stall. And they catch him, and judge him, and feel totally morally righteous. It is all so comical! But that is not how you are supposed to see it!AB: Russia and China (with Iran, Venezuela and many other countries) are intensifying de-dollarization in their mutual exchanges. Does it envisage a gradual weakening of the dollar capable of affecting international finance and what geopolitical repercussions?AV: Yes, definitely! And you should talk about it to my friend, Peter Koenig, a true dissident, a former economist at the World Bank, who is now actually advising many countries on de-dollarization.US dollars should not be used anymore. Western institutions should be ignored. Totally new structures should be, and are being erected. China and Russia are, of course, in the lead. All this is extremely important and can change the world, in the near future.AB: Venezuela, with the convening of the Constituent Assembly, turned off the coup attempts of the opposition. In Brazil Lula is favored in polls, while in Argentina the former President Cristina Fernandez is back in the Senate with strong popular support. So it was not the end of the progressive cycle, as the mainstream has for years stated?AV: Of course it was not the end! The desire of Lain Americans to live in just and egalitarian societies is too strong; it cannot be destroyed overnight.There were some serious setbacks   in Argentina and Brazil. And Venezuela is suffering immensely, battered by its own shameless elites sponsored from abroad. But the country is still standing.In Brazil, Temer is immensely unpopular. His  constitutional coup  will soon backfire. PT will be back, in its old form or in a new one. And it will be much stronger than before. The same goes for Argentina. You see, despite all the media manipulation, propaganda and shameless lies, people are already realizing that they were fooled. They want some decency back, they want socialism and pride and hope! They want true independence.In two weeks from now I m going back to South America. My book of essays is being published by LOM, soon, and LOM is a very important left-wing publishing house in Chile.

Could someone tell Obama we re broke?As working dinners go, President Obama s meal Monday night in Paris with French President Francois Hollande, Secretary of State John Kerry and others wasn t too shabby.No cartons of takeout   instead, the gang fueled up after a long day of climate talks at L Ambroisie, the three-Michelin-starred temple of gastronomie in the Marais neighborhood.Per the Michelin Guide, the ornately be-chandelier-ed dining room is known for  incomparable classicism and an immortal feast for the senses. Perhaps worried that Obama would create an international faux pas by ordering a burger or a margarita (two of his faves), a reporter asked what he planned to eat. Obama was, appropriately, diplomatic:  I will get recommendations from the president,  he answered, nodding in Hollande s direction.According to the AP, Obama cracked a joke about the opulence of the setting.  Don t break the chandelier,  he warned as a reporter s microphone got just a little too close to the crystal.  You can t afford it. ",politics,"Dec 1, 2015"

11751,HILLARY’S LAP DOG VA Senator Tim Kaine Calls For VIOLENCE In The Streets To COMBAT TRUMP [VIDEO],"Can anyone imagine a sitting Republican Senator calling for violence or fighting in the streets in opposition to a newly elected Democratic President? On Tuesday Democratic Senator Time Kaine told the Morning Joe in an interview that Democrats need to fight the Trump administration including online and on the streets in addition to  the ballot box.Partial Transcript:MIKA BRZEZINSKI, CO-HOST  MORNING JOE : So, broad question about the future of the Democratic Party, especially given your firsthand experience with what we ve all been through. There s so much going on here that we clearly see, you know, places where you   we can criticize what the administration is doing, but how does the party rebuild? How do you prevent overreach in a situation like this? How do you prevent a continuation of the bubble in a situation like this, and how does the party reclaim its reach across the country while fighting these battles? SEN. TIM KAINE (D-VA): So, the way we get outside the bubble is we take advantage of this tremendous public outcry against the administration. What we ve got to do is fight in Congress, fight in the courts, fight in the streets, fight online, fight at the ballot box, and now there s the momentum to be able to do this. And we re not afraid of the popular outcry, we re energized by it and that s going to help us do our job and do it better.  -GPListen to faux man Tim Kaine call for fighting on the streets here. Pay special attention to his comment about the  Women s March  that  was organized under a grassroots  label.'  It sounds like Kaine s admitting that it was organized under a grassroots  label  but that it wasn t really grassroots at all. Why didn t he just come out and admit that it was organized by Soros, Obama and Planned Parenthood?We could also add the DNC s California Chair: In a sign of the vigor of the party s distaste for the president, outgoing party Chair John Burton, a longtime Democratic lawmaker and powerbroker known for his blunt and profane manner, extended two middle fingers in the air as the crowd cheered and joined him. F  Donald Trump,  he said:Outgoing @ca_dem chair @Johnburton gets standing O w final words to his party, finger upraised:  F@ck Donald Trump!  pic.twitter.com/VIqNQlhDJc  Carla Marinucci (@cmarinucci) May 20, 2017And we though Tom Perez was bad: Tom Perez must not have taken the class about winning friends and influencing people. How can you win over voters with such bitterness and anger? The Democrat Party has sunk to a new low with this classless thug. Who goes out there and speaks like this? We reported (see below) on the last speech Perez gave and he said the same nasty things. What gives? Are the deems so desperate that they re now resorting to profanity-filled speeches that make false claims about Republicans and President Trump? We think it s a losing strategy!",politics,"Feb 2, 2017"
9119,PRICELESS! WATCH MSNBC HOST’S Shocked Response When GOP Lawmaker Calls For “Purge” of “Deep State” FBI and DOJ,"THIS IS PRICELESS! The video below shows just how out of control the left is when it comes to the corruption within the FBI and DOJ.When a Republican lawmaker called for a  purge  of what he said are  deep state  elements within the FBI and Justice Department, the MSNBC host Hallie Jackson was clearly agitated and shocked: I m very concerned that the DOJ and the FBI, whether you call it deep state or what, are off the rails,  Florida Rep. Francis Rooney stated then cited reasons behind his concern. The anti-Trump bias and the demotion of Bruce Ohr were just two of the examples Rooney gave.Jackson shot back,  Congressman, you just called the FBI and the DOJ off the rails. Something that you re okay with talking about here? How does that not sort of undermine the work that the agencies are doing? I don t want to discredit them. I would like to see the directors of those agencies purge it,  said Rooney.  And say look, we ve got a lot of great agents, a lot of great lawyers here, those are the people that I want the American people to see and know the good works being done, not these people who are kind of the deep state. Jackson responded:  Language like that, Congressman, purge? Purge the Department of Justice? Rooney responded,  Well, I think that Mr. Strzok could be purged, sure. Ms. Jackson might want to read up on the corruption that s been uncovered so far with the FBI and DOJ.",politics,"Dec 26, 2017"
7177, A MASSIVE Screw Up May Have Just Cost Trump The Nomination – And It’s All His Fault,"The people insisting the only thing standing in the way of Donald Trump s path to the nomination is Donald Trump himself may have finally been vindicated. In an explosive story first broken by TIME, Republican officials in South Carolina floated the idea that Trump may have given away his landslide victory in the state by brashly announcing that he would no longer adhere to the  Loyalty Pledge  if he didn t get the nomination.South Carolina Republican Party Chairman Matt Moore gave credence to the anti-Trump claims. Breaking South Carolina s presidential primary ballot pledge raises some unanswered legal questions that no one person can answer,  he told TIME.  However, a court or national convention Committee on Contests could resolve them. It could put delegates in jeopardy. What does this mean for Trump? The 50 delegates he won in South Carolina could simply walk away   and over to his opponents. That sends his delegate count a lot further away from the crucial 1,237 finish line, and maybe give his opponents the push they need to realistically challenge him at a brokered convention. And adding to the problem: Other states which include the loyalty pledge in their bylaws could also move to strip Trump of his delegates.All of this to say, Trump s massive ego is costing him the election. Having early on floated the idea that he wouldn t support a Republican candidate if it wasn t himself, Trump eventually caved and signed a document stating: I, Donald J. Trump, affirm that if I do not win the 2016 Republican nomination for President of the United States I will endorse the 2016 Republican nominee regardless of who it is. Suddenly, with opposition to his nomination mounting, Trump has returned to saying he will not adhere to that pledge, telling Anderson Cooper matter-of-factly:  No. I don t anymore,  arguing that he s been treated unfairly by the GOP.Trump has repeatedly ignored conventional wisdom and used his gut to direct his campaign   early on, Trump s campaign manager told staffers that the motto of the campaign would be  Let Trump Be Trump    and while it often works to his advantage (who would have thought calling John McCain a loser for being a POW would pay off?), his increasingly erratic behavior makes him a ticking time bomb. Cracks are beginning to emerge. His polls are tanking and there are signs that the  anti-Trump  members of the Republican Party are finally coalescing around his chief rival, Ted Cruz. He may have enough momentum to get the nod, but needlessly handing away delegates isn t doing him any favors.In the end there was only one serious contender against Trump and that was himself. For all of his arrogance, it is fitting that his own misplaced hubris would be the one thing that got the better of him. Having run as an outsider for his entire campaign, Trump is learning that bashing the party you plan to run for isn t welcomed with open arms. They let Trump be Trump and he didn t disappoint.Featured image via Darren Hauck/Getty Images ",News,"March 31, 2016"
6667, Speaker Of The Big House: Child Molester Dennis Hastert To Spend Over A Year In Jail,"Former Speaker Of The House Dennis Hastert got handed the sentence of 15 months in prison for monetary payoffs he made to keep his sexual abuse of young boys silent. The judge in the case called him a  serial child molester,  and also ordered him to enroll in a sex-offender treatment program.Hastert was accused of molesting 4 boys aged 14 to 17, during his time as a coach at Yorkville High School in Illinois. The case came to light when one of them finally broke decades of silence on Hastert s conduct.If you re thinking 15 months for molesting 4 boys is outrageous, you d be correct. Unfortunately, the statute of limitations has expired on the molestation cases. This forced the court to focus on illegal cash withdrawals that Hastert made to pay hush-money in order to keep the crimes buried.As is always the case with your average Republican who does something criminal, there is a news reel of them being hypocritical by attacking others for somewhat similar conduct. Hastert was a very vocal critic of then-President Bill Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky affair. Clearly, Bill was not in any sense as despicable as Hastert. However, that didn t stop Hastert from strongly attacking Clinton for it.Dennis Hastert on the House floor, 1998:When the allegations first came to light, Hastert did what all Republicans do; blame the victim. His initial response was to claim that the money withdrawal was because HE was the one being victimized by a blackmailer over a baseless claim of sexual abuse. This didn t end up working well for Hastert because the judge used it to hand down an even stronger sentence to him, with the judge telling him,  You tried to make him a victim again. U.S. Attorney comments on Hastert:This is yet another case of the universal hypocrisy that is a chronic condition of the Republican party. During a time when Republicans everywhere are trying to pass bathroom laws to  protect people  from the theorized molestations they believe will occur if a transgender individual uses a public bathroom, their party heroes keep getting nailed for doing the very thing they claim to hate.Here s a better idea. Since Republican men do this more than transgender individuals, we will make a  Republican Men s Bathroom.  We can do voter ID checks to make sure Republican men can only use their assigned bathroom because it s a  public safety issue,  as they like to say regarding their anti-LGBT bathroom laws. While we re at it, we can make Republican male-only movie theaters, restaurants and stores to help protect the public from mass shooters.Featured Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"April 27, 2016"
11888,DISRESPECTFUL DEMS EXPOSED! You’ll Never Guess Who Also Boycotted George W. Bush’s Inauguration [VIDEO],"It s a free country, and the nineteen (and counting) members of Congress who are planning to boycott President-elect Trump s inauguration are certainly within their rights. So even is Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., who said over the weekend that Trump s election (or his presidency) is  illegitimate. That doesn t make his comment true or honorable or helpful to the nation s well-being, but he is free to say it.Reps. Lewis, Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., Barbara Lee, D-Calif., Katherine Clark, D-Mass., and the other inaugural boycotters are certainly not alone in finding Trump uniquely awful. They are not alone in believing the president-elect has gone out of his way to offend people. Probably they also recognize that, in the safe districts they all represent, an inaugural boycott might even be a political winner.But this is also part of a pattern. Lewis and Lee, along with some other Democratic lawmakers at the time, also boycotted to make a point when President George W. Bush was inaugurated in 2001. The Washington Post reported at the time that Lewis  thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush s swearing-in because he doesn t believe Bush is the true elected president. Maybe they had a better excuse that time, as there was so much lingering acrimony surrounding the Florida recount. But we re talking about elected members of Congress who have refused to accept two Republican presidencies in a row. Is there always a good enough excuse whenever a Republican wins? At what point is it fair to ask whether some people are just not committed to democratic or legal processes at all unless the results come out as they hope?

1227, Trump Jr. Throws Temper Tantrum While Comey Testifies That His Dad Obstructed Justice,"Donald Trump has been asked by Republicans to not tweet during former FBI Director James Comey s testimony to Congress, so that task has apparently been given to his demon spawn instead.In his opening statement released on Wednesday, Comey shed light on a dinner he had with Trump in which Trump demanded Comey s loyalty. I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,  Trump said in January according to Comey.Comey then gave details of a meeting he had with Trump in February after the firing of Mike Flynn for having discussions with Russian officials.The President then returned to the topic of Mike Flynn, saying,  He is a good guy and has been through a lot.  He repeated that Flynn hadn t done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians, but had misled the Vice President. He then said,  I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go. It certainly sounds like Trump is guilty of trying to obstruct justice and that he fired Comey in order to sabotage the Russia investigation.As Comey testified in the Senate on Thursday, Donald Trump Jr. went on a tirade over it.1/3 Flynn stuff is BS in context 2 guys talking about a guy they both know well.

7708, Lifetime Republican Voter Thanks President Obama For Saving His Life With Obamacare,"Republican lawmakers hate Obamacare, but it s saving the lives of Republican voters.Even though Brent Brown hated the Affordable Care Act and refused to vote for President Obama in 2008 and 2012, the lifetime GOP voter from Wisconsin wrote a letter to the Democratic Commander-in-Chief apologizing for all the bad things he said and thanking Obama for saving his life.Brown thanked President Obama because the Affordable Care Act allowed him to finally access the medication he needs to  stabilize my condition. Prior to the passage of the landmark healthcare legislation, Brown had been denied health insurance because of a pre-existing condition. But because Obamacare requires insurance companies to cover people with pre-existing conditions, Brown was able to get the care he needed.So he wrote a heartfelt letter to President Obama in June, which the White House posted online, thanking him for saving his life and  for being my President.  Brown also admitted that he was wrong about the healthcare law.Here s the full letter via the White House.To My President,I sincerely hope that this reaches you, as far too often praise is hard to come by. Apologies to people who deserve it perhaps even less so.I did not vote for you. Either time. I have voted Republican for the entirety of my life. I proudly wore pins and planted banners displaying my Republican loyalty. I was very vocal in my opposition to you particularly the ACA.Before I briefly explain my story allow me to first say this: I am so very sorry. I understand written content cannot convey emotions very well but my level of conviction has me in tears as I write this. I was so very wrong. So very very wrong.You saved my life. I want that to sink into your ears and mind. My President, you saved my life, and I am eternally grateful.I have a  pre-existing condition  and so could never purchase health insurance. Only after the ACA came into being could I be covered. Put simply to not take up too much of your time if you are in fact taking the time to read this: I would not be alive without access to care I received due to your law. So thank you from a dumb young man who thought he knew it all and who said things about you that he now regrets. Thank you for serving me even when I didn t vote for you.Thank you for being my President.Honored to have lived under your leadership and guidance,Brent Nathan BrownIn a follow-up letter, Brown updated President Obama on how he is doing thanks to the Affordable Care Act.The Affordable Care Act saved my life. I can now say, after several surgeries, that I m in recovery from what was a serious autoimmune disease I was finally able to receive the quality of care that had eluded me for years. I was able to consult the top surgeon in my state for the particular surgery I needed. I was able to receive the stabilizing drug that was always hidden behind a doctor s apology:  I m sorry, Mr. Brown, we have to take your financial consideration into account.  I was able to stay at one of the best equipped hospitals in my state for as long as I needed, without having to worry about checking myself out early because of cost concerns. I had hope.If Republican lawmakers have their way, people like Brent Brown would lose this hope. They would be stripped of the newly found healthcare that they have waited years to finally receive. This letter is not only a testament to how Obamacare is helping millions of Americans, it s a warning to Republicans that they would be hurting their own voters by repealing the ACA.Brent Brown is a shining example of the Affordable Care Act s success and necessity, and he had the courage to say he was wrong and thank President Obama for fighting for him. It s too bad other Republicans refuse to do the same.Featured Image: Flickr",News,"March 4, 2016"
21045,HOW HILLARY CLINTON Has Secured Her Husband’s Legacy As “A Rapist” And Hers As An “Enabler” [VIDEO],"Hillary Clinton is a professional panderer. There is no vote she won t attempt to secure, no matter the cost. In reality, her desire to gain the vote of young women in America will only harm her, as her call to stop the sexual assaults against women on campuses across America only shines a light one of the ugliest aspects of the Clinton Crime Syndicate. Bill s pattern of sexual abuse, and Hillary s willingness to sit back and watch will undoubtedly to come back to haunt them. Anyone who thought Hillary could get away with this phony compassion for women who are truly sexual victims, underestimates the disdain that women on both sides of the aisle have for her and her serial rapist husband.Articles have now appeared in two left of center websites, VOX and Slate, noting that it s hard to dismiss Ms. (Anita) Broderick (claims of sexual assault by Bill Clinton) given the new progressive consensus on believing victims. Well the injunction to believe victims gained currency among progressives because of a potent mix of gender theory and advocacy statistics.The theory came from the legal scholar Catharine MacKinnon, who taught that: Feminism is built on believing women s accounts of sexual use and abuse and by men.  The statistics were supplied by activist researchers who claimed that women almost never lie about sexual assault. Now those activist statistics have been shredded, but among progressives, the doctrine of sexual victim infallibility, that lived on. But if victims are infallible, then those they accuse, must be presumed guilty. And that brings us to the Clintons. Hillary Clinton has signed on to that theory. Watch here: ",left-news,"Feb 2, 2016"
4704, Greta Van Susteren Slams Fox News For Not Dealing With Roger Ailes Sooner,"Fox News is collapsing like a house of cards as the fallout over rampant sexual harassment continues.Gretchen Carlson got the ball rolling when she filed a lawsuit against the conservative network, accusing Fox boss Roger Ailes of sexually harassing her and punishing her for refusing to have sex with him.Rather than stand by their colleague, however, Fox hosts such as Greta Van Susteren and others took Ailes  side instead.But now that Carlson has been vindicated and Ailes forced to resign, Van Susteren now regrets not believing the victim in the first place.In a post on Facebook on Friday, Van Susteren opened up about Carlson and expressed regret for not believing Carlson from the start. I read Geraldo s FB post in which he said he regretted not believing Gretchen Carlson s claim of sexual harassment,  she wrote.  We all regret it   I made my regret self evident in my GretaWire posting about 3 weeks ago which ended with this:  Gretchen, you go girl.  That said it all. Van Susteren continued by admitting that it was unfair for her to judge the case since she was 200 miles away from where the harassment took place and that she had never talked to Carlson about it to hear her side of the story personally. It is indeed true, when I read the complaint written by lawyers   I never spoke to Gretchen as she was long gone from Fox   I found it inconsistent with what was my experience and information at the Fox News Channel, admittedly working 200 miles from the  scene of the crimes.  It was hidden from all of us. Van Susteren left Fox News earlier this week and they replaced her with Brit Hume, a man who has spewed sexist remarks on the air for years.And now that she is no longer employed by Fox News, Van Susteren has absolutely no problem shaming her former employers for not doing anything about Roger Ailes sooner. But I have regrets beyond Geraldo s and beyond not believing a civil complaint written by lawyers. I regret that Roger Ailes was not supervised by those in a public corporation who had the duty to supervise him. This included his seniors, the CFO s of both Fox News Channel and 21CF (and its predecessor NewsCorp), the Board of Directors and what I assume this public corporation had, outside auditors. Checks written that were suspicious should have been spotted. But Fox News still hasn t learned much since many of the people who let Ailes get away with sexually harassing female employees, like Bill Shine, are still employed in their positions by the company.Even some high profile male hosts are still employed, including Steve Doocy, who was named in Carlson s lawsuit, and Bill O Reilly, who was named in Andrea Tantaros  lawsuit.Fox News needs to go beyond axing Ailes. They need to clean house or the working environment at Fox will simply continue being  like a sex-fueled, Playboy Mansion-like cult, steeped in intimidation, indecency and misogyny.

6053, Trump Angrily Goes After Hillary’s Competency With Misspelled Tweet,"On Thursday afternoon, Hillary Clinton delivered an impassioned speech regarding foreign policy and how dangerous Donald Trump would be not only to the nation, but to the world. She delivered it well and made point after point driving home the fact that Trump simply cannot be our next president.Not taking too kindly to the fact that Clinton was going after him, Trump quickly took to his medium of choice   Twitter.Trump wrote: Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn t even look presidential! Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton! Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn't even look presidential!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2016If only he knew how to spell teleprompter.And does Trump consider name-calling, explanation points and spelling incorrectly presidential? Apparently so.Oh, and yes, Trump did use a teleprompter for his foreign policy speech as well, and it was about as awkward as a 13-year-old boy asking the prettiest girl in school to the middle school spring fling.Truth be told, Trump doesn t even have the maturity level of a 13-year-old boy, probably more along the lines of a five- or six-year old. It s gotten to the point where you re waiting for him to tell people Hillary has cooties. Maybe he already has. Who s to know, really?Trump can go after Clinton all he wants on foreign policy, but the facts are the facts, and she absolutely wipes the floor with him in regards to experience. For example, he has none, and she s a former Secretary of State who is more traveled than any other Secretary of State in the history of the republic. She s brokered peace deals, for goodness sake.At the end of the day, it comes down to who can actually lead and get the job done, and Trump most certainly is not that person.

Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) could not say on Wednesday where he got the information that  thousands will die  if Obamacare is repealed.Sanders made the claim while speaking with CNN s Jake Tapper but could not provide any specific sources that backed his assertion, instead referring to  studies that have been done. You ve said if this repeal and replace plan goes forward that thousands of Americans will die,  Tapper said to Sanders.  Where do you get that estimate from? I get that estimate from the fact that studies have been done that people who do not have health insurance, who do not go to the doctor when they should, who do not go to the hospital when they need to go, in fact die,  Sanders said.  And thousands of people die every year because they don t have health insurance. And if you throw 24 million people off of health insurance, there is no doubt that many thousands of people will die. Jake Tapper then goes on to ask Bernie Sanders about the disastrous results of Obamacare, making insurance unaffordable for so many Americans. Tapper tells Sanders,  In many states Obamacare is in dire straights. The governor of Minnesota, a liberal Democrat said the  Affordable Care Act  is  unaffordable .  To his credit, Tapper continues with his line of questioning and actually shocks Sanders when he asks him,  Don t the Democrats own this bill that in so many states is failing? No, I think what the American, look, what you re saying is true,  Sanders replied.  No one, certainly not me, that the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, has many serious problems.

15133,WOW! New Email (Pictured) Uncovered Shows Hillary Telling Top Aide It’s A ‘Good Idea’ To Lie,"Who s Ready For Hillary?Among the thousands more Hillary Clinton s emails that have been released are ones exchanged with her top aide that may just add to the dilemma facing the 2016 Democratic Presidential candidate.Among the latest batch are emails from her adviser Sidney Blumenthal.On December 6, 2010 he sent her an email including a link to a news story with the headline:  U.S. Orders Diplomats to Stop Telling Truth Clinton replies:  Sounds like a good idea! The emails also reveal that Blumenthal felt the former Secretary of State was  vindicated  over the Libyan uprising even though the Benghazi scandal was still to come.Blumenthal told her in August 2011 she had to go on camera to announce the  successful strategy  when rebels took control of the country. He told her to speak to the media even if it meant giving a speech from the driveway of her holiday home in The Hamptons. Blumenthal wrote:  First, brava! This is a historic moment and you will be credited for realizing it.  When Qaddafi himself is finally removed, you should of course make a public statement before the cameras wherever you are, even in the driveway of your vacation house.  You must go on camera. You must establish yourself in the historical record at this moment. The most important phrase is:  successful strategy.  But in hindsight such vindication never materialized. In fact, Benghazi has become the second biggest headache for Hillary Clinton after Servergate. Over the following months after that email exchange, Libya slid into civil war and a year later US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed when the American embassy in Benghazi was overrun by militants. The ensuing scandal has been an albatross for the candidate.Clinton was forced to testify before a House Committee investigating the terror attack that killed ambassador Stevens and could still be recalled to face more questions. Meanwhile, Libya has become what the State Department has called a  safe haven  for terrorists and a main launching point for people smugglers sending migrants to Europe.

7395, This Charity Decided To Use Trump’s Money To Fight Hate And Is Rubbing It In His Face,"The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) is so upset by Donald Trump s racist and bigoted presidential campaign they are redirecting past donations they have received from the reality TV star and real estate tycoon into programs designed to fight bigotry.The ADL made their announcement in a press release:The Anti-Defamation League has decided to redirect the total amount of funds contributed to ADL by Donald Trump and his foundation over the years   about $56,000 in all   to fund new anti-bias and anti-bullying education programs across America. In the past decade or so, Mr. Trump and his foundation have contributed a total of $56,000 to our organization. These undoubtedly were sincere gifts,  said Jonathan A. Greenblatt, ADL CEO.  But in light of the recent campaign, we have decided to redirect the total amount of funds that he contributed to ADL over the years specifically into anti-bias education programs that address exactly the kind of stereotyping and scapegoating that have been injected into this political season. The announcement was made in advance of Trump s planned speech to AIPAC, the pro-Israel American Israel Public Affairs Committee.ADL also  called on other groups, philanthropies and nonprofits to consider redirecting charitable funds given to them by Mr. Trump into similar initiatives to combat hate, promote tolerance, and build a stronger American community. Jonathan A. Greenblatt, CEO of ADL, specifically referenced Trump s rhetoric   especially his  penchant to slander minorities, slur refugees, dismiss First Amendment protections and cheer on violence. During the campaign, Trump has said he would look into measures to curtail the First Amendment rights of the media with regards to stories he felt were unfair towards him. He has called for protesters at his rally to be punched, knocked out and manhandled (his campaign manager was recently caught on video grabbing a protester by the collar).A centerpiece of Trump s campaign has been attacking undocumented immigrants, blaming them for rape and drugs.

22933,"Collapsing: Why the ‘Russia Hack’ Witch Hunt Will Not End Well for Congress, or America","21st Century Wire says Washington s Russian witch hunt is now collapsing before our eyes. As host Patrick Henningsen revealed last Wednesday on ACR Radio, the supposedly damning information submitted by the FBI s private  cyber security  contractor Crowdstrike, of which the entire  Russian Hack  conspiracy theory hinges on   is fraudulent. Here is a link to their primary invented piece of  evidence  included in the US Intelligence Assessment. This means that we were correct back on Nov 1st when we said the Russian Hack story was a hoax designed distract from the explosive contents on the DNC and Podesta email leaks, and also to bolster a failing Hillary Clinton campaign by discrediting Donald Trump as being somehow in league with the evil Russians.If they keep pressing this story, it will only hurt the credibility of a Democratic Party that still refuses to admit the abject failures and corruption within of their political organization.Now the question remains: how more millions in US taxpayer money will Hollywood s Congressman Adam Schiff, and ringleaders Lindsey Graham waste before they re done trying to  look tough  on Russia and Trump? Will they be held accountable by anyone?In the end, we discover that Schiff, Feinstein, Graham, McCain and so many others in Washington have done extreme damage to American interests, and in the long run   to national security. Here s the story  US Congressman and NeoMcCarthyite Adam Schiff has himself become a ridiculous-looking caricature as of late. Justin Raimondo Antiwar.comThe allegation   now accepted as incontrovertible fact by the  mainstream  media   that the Russian intelligence services hacked the Democratic National Committee (and John Podesta s emails) in an effort to help Donald Trump get elected recently suffered a blow from which it may not recover.Crowdstrike is the cybersecurity company hired by the DNC to determine who hacked their accounts: it took them a single day to determine the identity of the culprits   it was, they said, two groups of hackers which they named  Fancy Bear  and  Cozy Bear,  affiliated respectively with the GRU, which is Russian military intelligence, and the FSB, the Russian security service.How did they know this?These alleged  hacker groups  are not associated with any known individuals in any way connected to Russian intelligence: instead, they are identified by the tools they use, the times they do their dirty work, the nature of the targets, and other characteristics based on the history of past intrusions.Yet as Jeffrey Carr and other cyberwarfare experts have pointed out, this methodology is fatally flawed.  It s important to know that the process of attributing an attack by a cybersecurity company has nothing to do with the scientific method,  writes Carr: Claims of attribution aren t testable or repeatable because the hypothesis is never proven right or wrong. Neither are claims of attribution admissible in any criminal case, so those who make the claim don t have to abide by any rules of evidence (i.e., hearsay, relevance, admissibility). Likening attribution claims of hacking incidents by cybersecurity companies to intelligence assessments, Carr notes that, unlike government agencies such the CIA, these companies are never held to account for their misses: When it comes to cybersecurity estimates of attribution, no one holds the company that makes the claim accountable because there s no way to prove whether the assignment of attribution is true or false unless (1) there is a criminal conviction, (2) the hacker is caught in the act, or (3) a government employee leaked the evidence. This lack of accountability may be changing, however, because Crowdstrike s case for attributing the hacking of the DNC to the Russians is falling apart at the seams like a cheap sweater.To begin with, Crowdstrike initially gauged its certainty as to the identity of the hackers with  medium confidence.  However, a later development, announced in late December and touted by the Washington Post, boosted this to  high confidence.  The reason for this newfound near-certainty was their discovery that  Fancy Bear  had also infected an application used by the Ukrainian military to target separatist artillery in the Ukrainian civil war. As the Post reported: While CrowdStrike, which was hired by the DNC to investigate the intrusions and whose findings are described in a new report, had always suspected that one of the two hacker groups that struck the DNC was the GRU, Russia s military intelligence agency, it had only medium confidence. Now, said CrowdStrike co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch,  we have high confidence  it was a unit of the GRU. CrowdStrike had dubbed that unit  Fancy Bear. Crowdstrike published an analysis that claimed a malware program supposedly unique to Fancy Bear, X-Agent, had infected a Ukrainian targeting application and, using GPS to geo-locate Ukrainian positions, had turned the application against the Ukrainians, resulting in huge losses: Between July and August 2014, Russian-backed forces launched some of the most-decisive attacks against Ukrainian forces, resulting in significant loss of life, weaponry and territory. Ukrainian artillery forces have lost over 50% of their weapons in the two years of conflict and over 80% of D-30 howitzers, the highest percentage of loss of any other artillery pieces in Ukraine s arsenal. Alperovitch told the PBS News Hour that  Ukraine s artillery men were targeted by the same hackers, that we call Fancy Bear, that targeted DNC, but this time they were targeting cell phones to try to understand their location so that the Russian artillery forces can actually target them in the open battle. It was the same variant of the same malicious code that we had seen at the DNC. He told NBC News that this proved the DNC hacker  wasn t a 400-pound guy in his bed,  as Trump had opined during the first presidential debate   it was the Russians.The only problem with this analysis is that is wasn t true. It turns out that Crowdstrike s estimate of Ukrainian losses was based on a blog post by a pro-Russian blogger eager to tout Ukrainian losses: the Ukrainians denied it. Furthermore, the hacking attribution was based on the hackers  use of a malware program called X-Agent, supposedly unique to Fancy Bear. Since the target was the Ukrainian military, Crowdstrike extrapolated from this that the hackers were working for the Russians.All somewhat plausible, except for two things: To begin with, as Jeffrey Carr pointed out in December, and now others are beginning to realize, X-Agent isn t unique to Fancy Bear. Citing the findings of ESET, another cybersecurity company, he wrote: Unlike Crowdstrike, ESET doesn t assign APT28/Fancy Bear/Sednit to a Russian Intelligence Service or anyone else for a very simple reason. Once malware is deployed, it is no longer under the control of the hacker who deployed it or the developer who created it. It can be reverse-engineered, copied, modified, shared and redeployed again and again by anyone. In other words     malware deployed is malware enjoyed! In fact, the source code for X-Agent, which was used in the DNC, Bundestag, and TV5Monde attacks, was obtained by ESET as part of their investigation! During our investigations, we were able to retrieve the complete Xagent source code for the Linux operating system . If ESET could do it, so can others. It is both foolish and baseless to claim, as Crowdstrike does, that X-Agent is used solely by the Russian government when the source code is there for anyone to find and use at will. Secondly, the estimate Crowdstrike used to verify the Ukrainian losses was supposedly based on data from the respected International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS). But now IISS is disavowing and debunking their claims: [T]he International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) told [Voice of America] that CrowdStrike erroneously used IISS data as proof of the intrusion. IISS disavowed any connection to the CrowdStrike report. Ukraine s Ministry of Defense also has claimed combat losses and hacking never happened . The CrowdStrike report uses our data, but the inferences and analysis drawn from that data belong solely to the report s authors,  the IISS said.  The inference they make that reductions in Ukrainian D-30 artillery holdings between 2013 and 2016 were primarily the result of combat losses is not a conclusion that we have ever suggested ourselves, nor one we believe to be accurate. One of the IISS researchers who produced the data said that while the think tank had dramatically lowered its estimates of Ukrainian artillery assets and howitzers in 2013, it did so as part of a  reassessment  and reallocation of units to airborne forces. No, we have never attributed this reduction to combat losses,  the IISS researcher said, explaining that most of the reallocation occurred prior to the two-year period that CrowdStrike cites in its report. The vast majority of the reduction actually occurs   before Crimea/Donbass,  he added, referring to the 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine. The definitive  evidence  cited by Alperovitch is now effectively debunked: indeed, it was debunked by Carr late last year, but that was ignored in the media s rush to  prove  the Russians hacked the DNC in order to further Trump s presidential ambitions. The exposure by the Voice of America of Crowdstrike s falsification of Ukrainian battlefield losses   the supposedly solid  proof  of attributing the hack to the GRU   is the final nail in Crowdstrike s coffin Continue this story at Antiwar.comREAD MORE RUSSIAN HACK NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Russian Hack FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE    SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER@ 21WIRE.TV ",Middle-east,"March 25, 2017"
6225, Hillary Beautifully Slams Trump’s ‘Dangerous’ And Idiotic Gun Policies,"It s no doubt Hillary Clinton has made gun violence a cornerstone in this election. For the first time, the issue of gun violence and mass shootings are at the forefront of national presidential politics.So it should only make sense that the GOP s candidate and the NRA s newest puppet Donald Trump would try to hijack that attention and sweep it under the rug.After the NRA gleefully endorsed the presidential blowhard, Trump promised to eliminate gun free zones (while speaking at a gun free gathering) while slamming Hillary Clinton as  heartless  for wanting to  restrict  people s access to guns.Clinton didn t take to kindly to former (and brushed off the latter). Speaking at a conference organized by the Trayvon Martin Foundation, Clinton said:This is someone running to be president of the United States of America   a country facing a gun violence epidemic   and he s talking about more guns in our schools, he s talking about more hatred and division in our streets. That s no way to keep us safe.The conference, organized by Trayvon Martin s mother Sybrina Fulton, aimed to bring together mothers who lost children to gun violence. Over 200 individuals showed up for the conference, including Fulton and Queen Thompson Brown, whose son was killed in Miami. Queen, not budging to the sensationalized claims of gun grabbing, told reporters that their mission is not to take away guns, but to promote  common sense gun laws. Clinton continued:We have a moral obligation to protect our children no matter what zip code they live in. If you want to imagine what Trump s America will look like, picture more kids at risk of violence and bigotry, picture more anger and fear.Saying she would not be silenced or bullied, Clinton pledged to stand up to the gun lobby, specifically the NRA.So the American people are faced with two options: one that cow tows to the NRA (even though he supported a ban on assault weapons) and one that has never waivered in her support of victims of gun violence. We have one candidate that promises gun free zones while preaching in a gun free zone, and another that sits down with mothers and fathers who have lost their children.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images",News,"May 22, 2016"

13875,LEADING N. CAROLINA NEWSPAPER: Girls Need To Attempt “Overcoming Discomfort” At Sight Of “Male Genitalia” In Locker Rooms,"The Leftist agenda in action blurring the lines of sexuality, while stripping humanity of any sense of individuality or morality A leading North Carolina newspaper issued an editorial last week telling girls to attempt  overcoming discomfort  at the sight of  male genitalia,  should transgender bathroom laws be enacted.In a defense of President Obama s order compelling schools to allow access to restrooms on the basis of gender identity, the Charlotte Observer editorial board compared the discomfort of school-aged girls seeing male genitalia in locker rooms to the discomfort of white people being around black people in post-segregation America. This is what the Obama administration nudged the rest of the country toward Friday,  the editorial said.  Yes, the thought of male genitalia in girls  locker rooms   and vice versa   might be distressing to some. But the battle for equality has always been in part about overcoming discomfort   with blacks sharing facilities, with gays sharing marriage   then realizing it was not nearly so awful as some people imagined. While admitting that exposure to male genitalia is a possible outcome of transgender bathroom laws, the editorial said the notion that such laws constitute a threat to the privacy and safety of women and children is a  political fiction  pushed by Republicans. Those safety issues are political fiction   non-transgender men wouldn t have been allowed in women s bathrooms under the Charlotte ordinance that HB 2 killed, and the 200 or so cities with similar ordinances have had no incidents involving bathroom predators,  the editorial said.

His cabinet is set to be the wealthiest in history and most of his picks are Washington insiders and elites that conservatives loathe.And many conservatives now realize that Trump is going to help Republicans wipe out Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, programs Trump repeatedly swore to leave intact.Trump will also not prosecute Hillary Clinton and the  big beautiful wall  he promised to build along the Mexican border is apparently going to be more like a lame fence instead.So, many of Trump s supporters are regretting the choice they made on Election Day and are expressing that regret on social media.

They will be forever known and mocked as the dumbasses who irrevocably damaged this country with their sheer stupidity. But Trump voters are far from the only people who should and do have regrets.

19902,LIBERAL DUMMY GARY JOHNSON Can’t Name One Foreign Leader [VIDEO],"Maybe comedy is a better career choice for Gary Gary Johnson, the Libertarian nominee for president, had been raring for Wednesday night s  town hall  on MSNBC. He had been cut from the first televised debate after missing the polling threshold, and he had not been invited when the network hosted a  commander-in-chief forum  with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. This was their consolation prize,  Johnson told The Washington Post this week when asked about the MSNBC special.  It was put to us that, look, you weren t in this initial program. Here s what we d like to offer in lieu of being with the two major-party candidates. And I said,  An hour of prime time Chris Matthews? I ll take it.   But the hour didn t go as planned. Johnson, who had been pilloried for blanking on the relevance of the Syrian city of Aleppo in another MSNBC interview, whiffed his way through an even easier foreign policy question. Who s your favorite foreign leader?  Matthews asked. Who s my favorite?  Johnson replied. Anywhere in the continents,  Matthews said.  Any country. Name one foreign leader that you look up to. William Weld, Johnson s running mate, chimed in with an assist:  I m with Shimon Peres. I m talking about living, okay?  Matthews said.  You gotta do this. Any continent. Canada, Mexico? I guess I m having an Aleppo moment,  Johnson said. In the whole world!  Matthews said.  Anybody in the world. I know, I know,  Johnson said. Pick any leader,  Matthews said. The former president of Mexico,  Johnson said. Which one?  Matthews said. I m having a brain freeze,  Johnson said.Weld, who had left the governor s office in Massachusetts in an unsuccessful attempt to become ambassador to Mexico, began naming the country s former presidents.  Fox? Zedillo? Calderon? Fox,  Johnson said with a combination of jubilation and relief.  He was terrific. ",left-news,"Sep 29, 2016"
14150,CHARLES BARKLEY Says Anyone Who Criticizes Obama Is A Racist…Gay Rights More Important Than Religious Freedom In America [VIDEO],"On March 20, 2016 Barkley had this to say about Obama:  Listen, you people in America who are upset that President Obama did a [March Madness NCAA Basketball] bracket   why don t ya ll just go say you don t like him because he s black. He continued,  Cut through all the BS   don t say he take too many vacations   just say,  We don t like him because he s black.'  Via: TMZLess than a month ago, Charles Barkley said anyone who disagrees with Obama does so because they are discriminating against him because he is black. And now, according to the all-knowing former NBA star, anyone who believes the religious rights of business owners should be protected is discriminating against gays. What about white Christians Charles? Are they entitled to any protections, or do you have to fall into some sort of minority category in order to have any rights or protections in the new progressive America? Charles Barkley wants to move All-Star game due to 'Anti-LGBT' lawhttps://t.co/P0hK7FpJFo  FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) April 8, 2016Retired professional basketball player and NBA analyst Charles Barkley has been bringing politics into this year s March Madness tournament left and right.His latest comments center around Indiana s Religious Freedom Act, the left s latest punching bag. Discrimination in any form is unacceptable to me,  Barkley said Friday in a statement released through his agent to USA Today.  As long as anti-gay legislation exists in any state, I strongly believe big events such as the Final Four and Super Bowl should not be held in those states  cities. The Religous Freedom Act prevents Indiana state and local governments from  substantially burdening a person s ability to exercise their religion   unless the government can show that it has a compelling interest and that the action is the least-restrictive means of achieving it,  according to the Indianapolis Star.The legislation, which will take effect July 1, makes no specific mention of sexual orientation, but it was quickly dubbed  anti-gay  by opponents.Barkley also turned the popular basketball tournament political when he made comments about President Obama s March Madness bracket. He said that people were criticizing Obama for filling out a bracket because  he s black.  Via: Red Alert Politics ",politics,"Apr 8, 2016"
7683, Alabama Supreme Court SHOCKS Conservatives With This Latest Ruling,"Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore is so pissed right now.Ever since the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in their Obergefell v. Hodges ruling last summer, Alabama has resisted following it.Almost immediately, Moore ordered county clerks and judges to refuse to help same-sex couples get married, claiming that the nation s high court has no power to overturn a state ban on same-sex marriage.Despite Moore s efforts to keep defying the Supreme Court, his colleagues on the state bench made the opposite decision on Friday.In a single sentence, the Alabama Supreme Court chose to not defy the high court by rejecting an anti-same-sex marriage case brought by the Alabama Citizens Action Program and the Alabama Policy Institute. It is ordered that all pending motions and petitions are dismissed,  the majority of the court ruled, thus ending the fight against federal authorities that Moore wanted so badly.According to the Associated Press,In one of several written opinions accompanying the order, Justice Greg Shaw called the decision a  clear refusal  to ignore the Supreme Court ruling last June.Several other state justices railed against the high court s ruling while noting they can t overturn it.Chief Justice Roy Moore wrote that previous state orders barring gay marriage in Alabama remain. Most probate judges already are ignoring that directive, however, and hundreds of same-sex couples already have wed in Alabama.NBC News had more about what Moore wrote in his dissenting opinion.Quoting everything from past court rulings to the Bible and the 1974 song  Feelings,  the chief justice called the court s ruling  immoral, unconstitutional and tyrannical.  He referred to homosexuality as a  disgrace to human nature  which can t be compared to opposite-sex intimacy. Sodomy has never been and never will be an act by which a marriage can be consummated,  Moore wrote.This is a victory for the LGBT community and a victory for sanity in general. Even Moore s fellow judges acknowledged that the U.S. Supreme Court has the final say and federal law trumps state law no matter how they may feel about same-sex marriage personally.It s definitely a significant setback for conservative  Christians  in the state who were hoping to keep bigotry, hate, and their ability to discriminate at will enshrined under state law.Featured image via Flickr",News,"March 5, 2016"
21095,WATCH: BLACK ACTRESS Stacey Dash Destroy Argument By Hollywood Race Agitator And Wife Of Will Smith: “Either we want to have segregation or integration”,"Stacey Dash is no stranger to controversy. She was recently suspended by FOX News when she said that [Barack]  Obama doesn t give a shit about terrorism. Today, on Fox and Friends, Stacey takes on Hollywood race hustler, and major Louis Farrakahn donor Jada Pinkett-Smith.Fox News contributor Stacey Dash asserted on Wednesday that Jada Pinkett Smith was a  hypocrite  for expecting some black actors to be nominated for an Oscar while the black community was enjoying special privileges like Black History Month and the BET channel.Watch Dash s appearance on Fox and Friends here:In a video posted to Facebook earlier this week, Smith revealed that she would not be attending the 88th Academy Awards to protest the fact all of the major nominees were white.(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));We must stand in our power.Posted by Jada Pinkett Smith on Monday, January 18, 2016After recently being suspended from Fox News for saying President Barack Obama did not  give a sh*t,  she was back on the network on Wednesday to respond to Smith. I think it s ludicrous,  she opined.  Because we have to make up our minds. Either we want to have segregation or integration. If we don t want segregation then we need to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the [NAACP] Image Awards, where you are only awarded if you are black. So you say there should not be a BET channel?  Fox News host Steve Doocy wondered. No, just like there shouldn t be a Black History Month,  Dash replied.  You know, we re Americans. Period. That s it. Are you saying there shouldn t be a Black History Month because there isn t a White History Month?  Doocy pressed. Exactly!  Dash insisted.According to Dash, the real problem was that Hollywood s support of President Barack Obama had not inspired filmmakers to create more black roles. We ve had a president who is black in office for the past eight years, who gets most of his funding from the liberal elite in Hollywood,  she said.  Yet, there are not very many roles for people of color. How can that be and why is it just now being addressed?  Via: RAW Story ",left-news,"Jan 20, 2016"
8796," ‘Tehran’ Tom Cotton Insults U.S. Troops, Tries To Spark War With Iran In Disgraceful Interview (VIDEO)","Nobody has spent more of his political career trying to undermine his own government than Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK). The Tea Party Republican most known for his borderline treasonous letter he sent to Iran in a shameful attempt to derail sensitive nuclear negotiations between President Obama and Iran s government. His ravings failed to accomplish anything and in recent months he s been relegated to the obscurity he deserves. Until now.On the night of the State of the Union, Cotton went on CNN s  Situation Room  to openly and egregiously spread lies about President Obama, even while a difficult situation was unfolding in Iran. On Tuesday evening, the Navy announced that two of its ships, and 10 U.S. sailors, were being held by the Iranian government after the boats floated into the country s territory.Conservatives rapidly lost their minds, even while details continued to come in suggesting the international incident was minor and, in all likelihood, harmless.The Americans were on a training mission in the Persian Gulf when the riverine boats experienced  a navigational or mechanical difficulty  and appear to have drifted into Iranian waters, according to the Pentagon. Iranian Coast Guard boats brought the vessels to a Revolutionary Guard base on Farsi Island, officials said.U.S. officials said they believe that craft steered off course and that the crew was aided, not captured, by Iranian forces. There doesn t seem to be anything malicious at work on either side,  according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the internal assessment.Iran said it was working on releasing the crew members  promptly. No big deal, right? In fact, the very lack of hostilities supports the idea that the tensions between the United States and Iran is cooling off, thanks to President Obama s commitment to negotiations.Not as Sen. Cotton tells it. Speaking straight into the camera, Cotton spews lie after lie. His only agenda, to hurt the president s reputation and provoke a hostile response from Iran.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3j8cFq6vUU]In labeling the ships  captured  and the crew held  hostage,  Cotton is viciously lying about the troops. They weren t taken by force. They aren t gagged and bound somewhere in enemy territory. Their boat experienced difficulties and they were rescued by Iranian ships. They never surrendered. The United States was never asked to  apologize  to the Iranians.But by fear-mongering to score political points, Cotton does risk inflaming tensions. Not that the lives of these men and women register in the deep, dark cavity where Cotton s brain allegedly lives. It s clear that even waiting until the sailors are safely out of Iran is too much to ask for a Republican who is hell-bent on painting the Middle Eastern country as a dangerous enemy.As usual, American soldiers are being used by a Republican to serve his agenda. Secretary of State John Kerry couldn t do an interview with CNN, even if it might have helped Democrats in the polls, he was too busy talking personally with Iranian officials, coordinating the release of these soldiers.So going into tonight s State of the Union, where rhetoric on both sides will be high, ask yourself this: Which politician  supports  the troops more? The one who uses them as bargaining chips to lie his way into better poll numbers or the one who spent the last few hours making sure they get home safely.Feature image via YouTube",News,"January 12, 2016"
16711,HARVARD BULLIED INTO Dropping 80 Year Old “Racist” Law School Emblem,"Harvard is agreeing to erase the history of their Law School founder to satisfy individuals or groups who don t agree with him. Didn t we see something similar to this happening in the Middle East? It wasn t that long ago that ISIS destroyed all symbols of Christianity in Iraq and other countries because they represented the history of Christ and was offensive to the Islamic terrorists. Did Americans think that was okay? This politically incorrect nonsense needs to stop before every ounce of history has been sanitized from our public and private schools, colleges and universities Harvard University has decided to drop its famous law school emblem after a handful of students said it was racist because it was tied to an 18th-century family of slave holders.The Harvard Corporation, the body that governs the university, voted in favor of a Harvard Law School committee recommendation to drop the seal. Harvard s president, Drew Faust, told the dean of the law school, Martha Minow, he approved the idea, Reuters reported.The emblem has been around since 1936. It shows three sheaves of wheat with the motto,  Veritas,  the Latin word for truth, scrolled across the top.The image comes from the coat of arms used by the family of Isaac Royall, a man the media paints as the son of an Antiguan slaveholder   who was also the endower of the first law professorship at the university, Reuters said.

As Glenn Beck was merrily rallying Republicans in the name of Ted Cruz, competitor Donald Trump gatecrashed the event and proceeded to give an impromptu speech to the assembled audience.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 23, 2016Then, came the in-person assault.Conservative pundit Beck was literally on stage, making his case to vote Cruz before a large crowd, when Trump stormed the hall. Trump, flanked by security, was immediately mobbed by the GOP fans in the room. He then picked up a microphone and began his own impromptu speech, cutting Beck dead.The crowd seemed all-too-happy to have their Cruz-fest interrupted by the GOP favorite, gathering tightly around the candidate and cheering in response to his weird and creepy speech.MSNBC happened to be broadcasting live at the Palo Verde High School in Summerlin, and was able to capture the bizarre scenes in full.Beck stood in silence on the stage, looking on helplessly as his event was overtaken by Trump, who told crowds: We are going to have hopefully a historic night, I appreciate everybody being here. I wanted to be here myself and say a few words. Get over there and vote! Make America great again! Trump went on to win Nevada by a landslide, with Marco Rubio narrowly pushing Ted Cruz into third place.He won a massive 45.9% of the vote, knocking Marco Rubio into 2nd place with just 23.9%, and Cruz in 3rd on 21.4%.

10353,"REAL INDIAN, GOP Senate Hopeful Shiva Ayyadurai Just Got Great News…FAKE INDIAN Elizabeth Warren Aligns Herself With Hillary Clinton In New Fundraising Email","Mass Live  Ayyadurai, who announced his Republican U.S. Senate bid in February, said that while he may not be the GOP establishment s candidate, his track record of overcoming barriers and fighting big institutions makes him the best person to take on the high-powered incumbent. I know that Warren   in spite of (what) people think she is   is extremely weak,  he said in an interview.  She s a formidable enemy, but weak in the sense that where she s fundamentally coming from, her basis of where she s coming from, has massive weakness and I know how to expose that weakness. Ayyadurai, 53, moved to the U.S. from India as a child. He compared the Democratic senator and former Harvard University professor to those at the top of India s caste system   a social structure in which he said his family held a low position. If you look at what we have today, we have a neo-caste system and at the top of that heap is people like Warren,  he said.  They are the academics, career politicians and lawyer/lobbyists. And that clan   is extremely spineless, they never expect to be challenged. And I ve challenged them. Last month, Ayyadurai made news when he sent Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren a DNA kit for her birthday (which she rejected) after Warren was caught lying about being a Native American on a application for a teaching position at Harvard University, allegedly hoping that her fake minority status would place her ahead of other applicants for the job.Senator Elizabeth Warren is not only a liar, she s also not very bright. Warren sent out an email today that was clearly designed to appeal to women. In the email, Warren names the very unpopular Hillary Clinton, not only once, but twice. Warren starts out the email by mentioning Hillary s name in the first sentence:Hillary Clinton said that  it takes a village,  and she was right.  None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community, or lift a country totally alone. Warren used Hillary s name again near the end of her email:Every minute counts to get a campaign off the ground. It mattered the most when the DSCC helped launch my Senate campaign, and when they were there for Hillary when she launched her Senate career 17 years ago.Apparently, Warren missed the dreadful polls showing how the wildly unpopular Hillary Clinton s like ability continues to plummet, even after the race.If Warren stays the course and continues to align herself with Crooked Hillary, the very successful entrepreneur and President Trump supporter Shiva Ayyadurai will no doubt be able to use her embarrassingly bad decision to his advantage.Mass Live- If elected, Ayyadurai said he hopes to bring a sense of innovation to the Senate when it comes to addressing hot-button issues, as well as to look at problems from an engineering and science perspective.Casting himself as a  Lincoln Republican,  the entrepreneur said his campaign platform will largely focus on three areas: immigration, education and innovation.As an immigrant, Ayyadurai said he believes it is important that the U.S. secure its borders, root out so-called sanctuary cities and ensure people enter the country legally.He added that he also supports ensuring parents and students have choices when it comes to public education, and argued that more must be done to address what he called  pay-to-play  academic science research.Ayyadurai, who holds four degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is the founder and chairman of CytoSolve, a startup that has developed a  computational platform for scalable integration of molecular pathway models  used in drug development.He is one of three Republicans who have filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run for the Massachusetts Senate seat in 2018.To donate to Shiva Ayyadurai s senate campaign, click HERE.Here is Warren s email:Friend  Hillary Clinton said that  it takes a village,  and she was right.  None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community, or lift a country totally alone. I ve seen what a village, a community, and a movement can do, one action at a time. And I ve seen how women can help women   especially when we run for office.I sure remember what it was like running for the Senate as a first-time candidate in 2011. I had to learn everything it took to raise money, build a grassroots organizing operation, and stand up to a Republican incumbent with $10 million in the bank   and I had to do it fast.And here s what I know: I absolutely, positively couldn t have done it on my own.So when the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee told me they wanted a strong launch of the Women s Senate Network for the 2018 cycle, to help women run and make sure more voices like mine and Hillary s are in the Senate, I immediately told them:I m all in.Today, I m asking you to join me in becoming a 2018 founding member of the DSCC Women s Senate Network. Because you were there for Hillary, I m hoping you ll add your name to help us build a community to support women who run for office.Now let me be blunt: 2018 is going to be a hard year for Democrats. We ve got 10 women who are up for reelection to the Senate, including me   more than ever before in history. And many are in some really tough races.That s why the DSCC s Women s Senate Network is ramping up its 2018 efforts early to elect and protect smart, tough, and experienced candidates to fight for what s right   senators who understand that being a woman is not a pre-existing condition, that we deserve equal pay for equal work, and that we sure as heck need Planned Parenthood and affordable health care for hardworking families.Let s continue our fight and get more women in leadership in this country.I m counting on you to keep fighting for what we all started: become a 2018 founding member of the DSCC Women s Senate Network today. You ll even get your very own  Nevertheless, She Persisted  sticker when you do!Every minute counts to get a campaign off the ground. It mattered the most when the DSCC helped launch my Senate campaign, and when they were there for Hillary when she launched her Senate career 17 years ago.And with your help, we can be there for the women who need help defending their seats now and for the next generation of women candidates ready to move into leadership.

1114, Dem Senator ‘Increasingly Concerned’ Trump Will Fire Mueller And Rosenstein To Stop Russia Probe,"Donald Trump is desperate to stop the investigation into his dirty Russian escapades and even went as far as firing FBI Director James Comey, who just happened to be investigating him. Now, Sen. Dianne Feinstein says she is growing  increasingly concerned  that Trump might try to fire both Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is overseeing the probe into Trump s possible collusion with Russia and his obstruction of justice, and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.Feinstein, who is the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, laid out her concerns in a statement on Friday. The message the president is sending through his tweets is that he believes the rule of law doesn t apply to him and that anyone who thinks otherwise will be fired. That s undemocratic on its face and a blatant violation of the president s oath of office,  she wrote.Citing Trump s most recent tweets regarding the Russia investigation, which he has repeatedly called a  witch hunt,  Feinstein said Trump has  embarked on an effort to undermine anyone with the ability to bring any misdeeds to light. The Senate should not let that happen. We re a nation of laws that apply equally to everyone, a lesson the president would be wise to learn,  Feinstein said.Trump doesn t have the authority to fire Mueller. However, he can order Rosenstein to fire him. When Rosenstein testified before Congress, he said that he would only consider firing Mueller if there was  good cause.  But if Trump wanted to, he is able to fire Rosenstein and appoint someone who, after Senate confirmation, would follow his orders blindly.But Feinstein warned that this would be a huge mistake on Trump s part and would inevitably lead to a revolt of  even his staunchest supporters. If the president thinks he can fire Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein and replace him with someone who will shut down the investigation, he s in for a rude awakening. Even his staunchest supporters will balk at such a blatant effort to subvert the law,  she said.The similarities between Trump and Nixon just keep piling up. If he were to go the route Feinstein fears, it would be the Saturday Night Massacre all over again and would probably lead to the same outcome: impeachment.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"June 16, 2017"

Kate Brown Upset by Jury Decision","21st Century Wire Yesterday, Judge Anna Brown handed out  not guilty  verdicts to both Ammon and Ryan Bundy, leaders of the 41 day occupation of Malheur National Wildlife refuge near Burns, Oregon earlier this year.  The Bundys along with five other defendants, were acquitted of all major charges relating to the Oregon protest event, including  conspiring to impede refuge employees  and possession of firearms at a federal facility. Ammon Bundy led the protest in Oregon in January 2016.Ammon and Ryan Bundy are still being held in custody however, awaiting a second trial will they will face federal charges in the state of Nevada over the high-profile Bundy Ranch Standoff with the employees of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) near Bunkerville in April 2014.The Burns standoff came to an abrupt end after one protest spokesman and Arizona resident, Robert LaVoy Finicum (photo, left), died after police fired on protester vehicles, before a special federal tactical team tracked, shot and killed the rancher at a pre-planned ambush along a remote rural road outside of Burns.Not surprisingly, the surprise acquittal has sent Democratic Party-linked media outlets into a tail spin. The New York Times still labelled the the Bundy brothers as  Armed antigovernment protesters  indicating a hyperbolic editorial bias against the defendants which was visible through the trajectory of this story.Similarly, both Oregon Gov. Kate Brown and Harney County Sheriff David Ward are on record saying that were not happy with Friday s verdict, not surprisingly, as both these officials played a crucial role in the state s escalation of violence which colminated in Finicum s death. Brown even issued a public statement saying she was disappointed  the jury s decision.Despite a campaign of highly coordinated  trial by media  propaganda, led by the Oregonian Newspaper and other federal-leaning media outlets like the Washington Post, and ultra-liberal websites like Salon.com the jury was still able to judge the facts, and eventually ruled on the side of the protesters. I knew that what my husband was doing was right, but I was nervous because the judge was controlling the narrative,  said Angela Bundy, 39, wife of Ryan to a Times reporter.According to one juror, the verdict was a statement regarding the various failures of the prosecution  to prove that there was a conspiracy   indicating that the federal government s botched affair might have been down to over-zealous political atmosphere in Washington that led to proscecutors going for a completely over-the-top set of charges in order to make a political statment   instead of just sticking to the facts and Constiutional law.Police Tase Bundy Lawyer in CourtroomRight after the verdict was rendered, a bizarre courtroom scene erupted which ended in one of the Bundy s defense lawyers was tased and taken into custody after he asked the court to produce paperwork showing the order to rearrest  his client.

20200,49 Year Old “Political Refugee” Flies To Dubai Days Before Trial For RAPE Of Grade School Girl In Washington,"How does a refugee who is facing trial for the rape of a school aged girl board a plane in America and fly overseas to another country? The little girl who was allegedly raped by this man probably wishes she had a plane she could ve boarded to get away from him. A 49-year-old man reportedly boarded a flight for the United Arab Emirates two days before he was to stand trial in Kennewick on charges of raping and molesting a grade-school girl.A nationwide arrest warrant was issued this week for Khalid A. Fathey after he was a no-show at his Benton County Superior Court trial.The U.S. Marshals Service then discovered that Fathey left Seattle on July 23 on a plane bound for Dubai, said Deputy Prosecutor Anita Petra.Fathey was free on his personal recognizance since being charged with the sex crimes in May 2015. He now faces a new charge of bail jumping.Judge Vic VanderSchoor waited 1 1/2 hours Monday   in case Fathey had car trouble or another problem   before calling off the trial, releasing the jurors and ordering the arrest warrant.Kennewick attorney Kevin Holt, who was hired by Fathey, said he met with his client for about eight hours on July 21 and then prepared for the trial. He assured me that he would be here Monday morning,  Holt said.Holt said his client is from northern Iraq. Fathey had been in the military and worked with the United States government after the 2003 invasion, he said.Since Fathey was no longer welcome in Iraq under the new regime, he sought political asylum and came to the United States with his wife and children as political refugees, Holt said.Fathey and his wife were paid by the state for four years to be full-time caregivers for a Tri-City woman who had medical issues, he said.Fathey contends the sex crimes did not happen and were made up by the girl s family. Fathey and his family had to move to Spokane from Kennewick about six months ago because they were afraid for their safety in the Tri-Cities, especially after someone reportedly set fire to their car, said Holt.Prosecutors allege the girl s mother became suspicious in December 2014 when she found the girl and Fathey together, and Fathey  appeared nervous. The girl later disclosed to her mother that Fathey allegedly kissed her and touched her sexually several times over a six-month period. Fathey  told (the girl) never to tell or she was going to get in trouble,  documents said.Before the police were involved, Fathey called his religious leader, who had them sit down together with the girl s parents, court documents said. Fathey admitted to the inappropriate touching but would not elaborate, documents said.The girl s mother fainted during the meeting, and police were called.Fathey is charged with one count of first-degree rape of a child and two counts of first-degree child molestation. All three counts include the aggravating circumstance that he used a position of trust to commit the crimes.Read more here: Tri-City Herald",left-news,"Jul 30, 2016"
4634, NYPD So Delighted With Cop Who Killed Eric Garner They Now Pay Him $120K,"Daniel Pantaleo was caught on video using an illegal chokehold on Eric Garner, killing him in front of the entire world for the crime of selling loose cigarettes. There was a lengthy investigation, but ultimately no indictment, despite public outrage and widespread protests. Now, a new report of payroll records shows just how delighted the NYPD was with Pantaleo and his deadly actions.Ever since Pantaleo killed Garner on that New York City street, he has consistently gotten raise after raise, even while being actively investigated for Garner s death, and is now making upwards of $120,000 a year.A report from Politico reads: Pantaleo earned $119,996 in fiscal year 2016, which includes earnings between July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016. His base pay was $78,026 and he earned $23,220 in overtime, according to a review of payroll records. He received an additional $12,853 in unspecified pay, which could include retroactive pay or bonuses.Pantaleo s earnings in 2016 represent a 35 percent increase in overtime pay, and a 14 percent overall increase from the previous fiscal year, which began shortly before Garner s death on July 17, 2014.In that 12-month period, ending June 30, 2015, Pantaleo earned $105,061, with $76,488 base pay, $17,109 in overtime and $11,673 in additional earnings, records show.In fiscal year 2014, which was completed before Garner s death and Pantaleo s subsequent reassignment, he made $99,915, which included $17,189 in overtime. An investigation into Garner s killing by the Department of Justice is ongoing and the NYPD has still not released the results of their investigation. Mayor Bill DeBlasio insists that state law prevents Pantaleo s full disciplinary file from being released. This claim prompted Governor Andrew Cuomo to call bullshit and he told DeBlasio not to blame  the state law when a judge interpreted the law otherwise and your office is now contradicting the judge. So far, this is what we do know about Pantaleo s record as one of New York s finest, according to Latest.com:  Pantaleo was involved in at least three lawsuits in which he allegedly violated a (black) citizen s civil rights. He was disciplined for a bogus  stop and frisk  incident before the NYPD banned the practice. In April he was named as a defendant with the NYPD for allegedly crashing his cruiser into another man s car and injuring the driver. So in America, when a cop kills an unarmed black man with an illegal chokehold and there is video proof, not only does he get a paid vacation, he also gets one hell of a pay raise. Something is very wrong with this picture.Featured image via Latest.com",News,"September 14, 2016"
18466,BREAKING: WATCH TWO PROTESTERS Crash ‘Trump Assassination’ Play in NYC: “Liberal Hate Kills!” [Video],"Awesome! Two protesters crashed the  Trump Assassination  play tonight yelling  Goebbels would be proud!  and  Liberal Hate Kills!  This is the second night protesters have jumped on stage at the Shakespeare in the Park production of Julius Caesar where a modern twist shows a President Trump look-a-like assassinated. Lovely, huh?A second protester jumped on stage and yelled but a videographer capturing the moment was tackled by liberal thugs.The videographer was eventually released by the police with the assurance that the police are on their side.In case you missed the first protest on Friday night: Laura Loomer of Rebel Media rushed the stage at the controversial NYC Shakespeare in the Park performance that takes a modern twist on Julius Caesar by playing out an assassination of a President Trump look-alike. Loomer yelled  stop leftist violence  before she was escorted off stage.We re huge fans and hope more people will follow her lead. Can you imagine if the tables were turned and they performed the same play using Obama as the one to be assassinated? The double standard here is unbelievable! You have the blood of Steve Scalise on your hands! The interesting irony is that the liberal crowd screamed and yelled at her. The left loves civil disobedience -except when it spoils their enjoyment of highbrow assassination porn. Do they advocate for violence against our president?They literally have Antifa chants during Julius Caesar before Trump gets assassinated pic.twitter.com/6AbHOChSnC  Jack Posobiec   (@JackPosobiec) June 17, 2017Ms. Loomer was arrested by the the NYPD and was released within hours. Laura s press conference: Jack Posobiec also got up and bravely yelled at the crowd. He yelled  You re all Goebbels In case you don t know:GOEBBELS WAS THE NAZI PROPAGANDA MINISTER:German Nazi Party member Joseph Goebbels became Adolf Hitler s propaganda minister in 1933, which gave him power over all German radio, press, cinema, and theater.In 1925 Goebbels met the party leader Adolf Hitler. In 1926 he was made Gauleiter, or party leader, for the region of Berlin, and in 1927 he founded and became editor of the official National Socialist periodical Der Angriff (The Attack). He was elected to the Reichstag, the German parliament, in 1928. By exploiting mob emotions and by employing all modern methods of propaganda Goebbels helped Hitler into power. His work as a propagandist materially aided Hitler s rise to power in 1933. When Hitler seized power in 1933, Goebbels was appointed Reichsminister for propaganda and national enlightenment. From then until his death, Goebbels used all media of education and communications to further Nazi propagandistic aims, instilling in the Germans the concept of their leader as a veritable god and of their destiny as the rulers of the world. In 1938 he became a member of the Hitler cabinet council. Late in World War II, in 1944, Hitler placed him in charge of total mobilization. As Reichsminister for Propaganda and National Enlightenment, Goebbels was given complete control over radio, press, cinema, and theater; later he also regimented all German culture. Goebbels placed his undeniable intelligence and his brilliant insight into mass psychology entirely at the service of his party. His most virulent propaganda was against the Jews. As a hypnotic orator he was second only to Hitler, and in his staging of mass meetings and parades he was unsurpassed. Utterly cynical, he seems to have believed only in the self-justification of power. He remained loyal to Hitler until the end. On May 1, 1945, as Soviet troops were storming Berlin, Goebbels committed suicide.Via: whale",left-news,"Jun 18, 2017"
13906,"BREAKING BOMBSHELL: Blonde Clinton Neighbor, Dubbed The “Energizer” Gets $2 MILLION From Clinton “Charity”","Here s how Donald Trump reacted Donald Trump reacted Friday to a report that the Clinton Global Foundation provided millions to a power company partly owned by a rich, blond divorcee by saying that people have been whispering about her possible romantic ties to Bill Clinton for a long time.The  commitment  to Julie Tauber McMahon s firm from the Clinton Global Initiative was placed on its 2010 conference agenda at Clinton s urging, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.The initiative  commits $2 million to support the work of Energy Pioneer Solutions, a company founded to deliver energy savings to communities in rural America,  said a 2010 statement from the charity. People have been talking about this for years. I have no idea what went on. I certainly don t,  the presumptive GOP presidential nominee said on  Fox & Friends. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, the Clinton Global Initiative doled out $2 million to Energy Pioneer Solutions, which is partly owned by Julie Tauber McMahon.The fit, blond mother of three, who lives just minutes from Bill and Hillary Clinton s home in Chappaqua, West chester, is the daughter of Joel Tauber, a millionaire donor to the Democratic Party.McMahon, 54, is rumored to be the woman dubbed  Energizer  by the Secret Service at the Clinton home because of her frequent visits, according to RadarOnline.Secret Service agents were even given special instructions to abandon usual protocol when the woman came by, according to journalist Ronald Kessler s tell-all book,  The First Family Detail. You don t stop her, you don t approach her, you just let her go in,  says the book, based on agents  accounts. Energizer  is described in the book as a charming visitor who sometimes brought cookies to the agents.The book describes one sun-drenched afternoon when agents took notice of the woman s revealing attire. It was a warm day, and she was wearing a low-cut tank top, and as she leaned over, her breasts were very exposed,  an agent is quoted in the book as saying. Energizer  reportedly timed her arrivals and departures around Hillary Clinton s schedule.When asked about whether there should be a probe into money directed from the foundation   a charity   to the company, Trump said:  Well, I assume you put the word  charity  in quotes. The interviewer, who cited the New York Post s cover story, told Trump that Clinton helped steer an $812,000 federal grant to the company through then-Energy Secretary Steven Chu.The interviewer also pointed out that  nonprofits are not supposed to act in anyone s private interests.

20222,"“ALLAHU AKBAR” MUSLIM EXTREMISTS Forced Catholic Priest At Knifepoint To Kneel While They Performed “Arabic Sermon”….Filmed Beheading Of Priest…Two Terrorists Shot DEAD…19 Yr Old Was KNOWN TERRORIST Allowed To Live With Parents, Roamed Freely During Day [VIDEO]","FRANCE HAS THE BLOOD OF THIS PRIEST ON THIER HANDS! Their political correctness allowed this KNOWN TERRORIST to roam freely in the streets! Shame on their progressive values that made it possible for this beautiful 84 year old priest, who was filling in at the church to be beheaded by these monsters!  The ISIS knifemen who stormed into a church in Normandy filmed themselves butchering an elderly priest after forcing him to kneel   before they performed a  sermon in Arabic  at the altar, a terrified witness has revealed today.The 84-year-old priest, named as Jacques Hamel, had his throat cut in a Normandy church this morning in an attack that also left a nun critically injured and both jihadis dead.The two killers, who were both known to French authorities, were shot dead by police marksmen as they emerged from the building shouting  Allahu Akbar . The building was later searched for bombs.One of the extremists who stormed into the church in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray near Rouen during mass was a French 19-year-old named Adel K., who was being monitored by electronic tag after twice attempting to join fanatics in Syria. Unbelievably, his bail terms allowed him to be unsupervised between 8.30am and 12.30pm   the attack happened between 9am and 11am.Adel K is understood to have forced the priest to kneel while his accomplice, who also lived locally and was on a terrorist watchlist, filmed the brutal killing.This afternoon it emerged that the murdered clergyman was deputising while the regular parish priest was on holiday. French authorities say they have arrested a third man over the attack   a 17-year-old man believed known as HB and believed to be a relative of Adel K.It was also revealed that the Catholic church involved was on a terrorist  hit list  found in the apartment of a suspected ISIS extremist last April.Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy called for a  merciless  response to the killing while  horrified  ex-Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin said he feared  everything is being done to trigger a war of religions .France s Socialist president Francois Hollande addresses the Islamic terror attack with the press here: A nun who was in the church during the attack said the priest was forced to the ground before his throat was slit.French authorities admitted that both of the attackers were subject to security  S  files, meaning both were known terror suspects who should have been under surveillance.Adel K. was a convicted terrorist who was meant to be living with his parents in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray with an electronic tag on his ankle.In March 2015, while still a minor, he tried to reach the terror group s base in Syria via Germany, but was arrested in Munich.  He was placed under judicial control with his parents, but after his 18th birthday again tried to return to the Middle East.Accompanied by two childhood friends, Adel K. headed to Switzerland overland and then took a plane to Turkey, hoping to cross the border into Syria.Turkish police deported him back to Switzerland and, after being sent back to his hometown, he was tried and found guilty of  associating with a terrorist enterprise  on May 22 2015.After spending less than a year of his two-and-a-half-year sentence in prison, he was released on March 22 this year.For entire story: Daily Mail ",left-news,"Jul 26, 2016"
22212,"FAKE NEWS WEEK: Truth, War Propaganda, CIA and Media Manipulation"," In response to the establishment media s contrived  fake news  crisis designed to marginalise independent and alternative media sources of news and analysis, 21WIRE is running its own #FakeNewsWeek campaign, where each day our editorial team at 21st Century Wire will feature media critiques and analysis of mainstream corporate media coverage of current events   exposing the government and the mainstream media as the real purveyors of  fake news  throughout modern history The Centre for Research on GlobalizationNever before has it been so important to have independent, honest voices and sources of information. We are   as a society   inundated and overwhelmed with a flood of information from a wide array of sources, but these sources of information, by and large, serve the powerful interests and individuals that own them. The main sources of information, for both public and official consumption, include the mainstream media, alternative media, academia and think tanks.The mainstream media is the most obvious in its inherent bias and manipulation. The mainstream media is owned directly by large multinational corporations, and through their boards of directors are connected with a plethora of other major global corporations and elite interests. An example of these connections can be seen through the board of Time Warner.Time Warner owns Time Magazine, HBO, Warner Bros., and CNN, among many others. The board of directors includes individuals past or presently affiliated with: the Council on Foreign Relations, the IMF, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Warburg Pincus, Phillip Morris, and AMR Corporation, among many others.Two of the most  esteemed  sources of news in the U.S. are the New York Times (referred to as  the paper of record ) and the Washington Post. The New York Times has on its board people who are past or presently affiliated with: Schering-Plough International (pharmaceuticals), the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, Chevron Corporation, Wesco Financial Corporation, Kohlberg & Company, The Charles Schwab Corporation, eBay Inc., Xerox, IBM, Ford Motor Company, Eli Lilly & Company, among others. Hardly a bastion of impartiality.And the same could be said for The Washington Post, which has on its board: Lee Bollinger, the President of Columbia University and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and individuals associated with (past or presently): the Coca-Cola Company, New York University, Conservation International, the Council on Foreign Relations, Xerox, Catalyst, Johnson & Johnson, Target Corporation, RAND Corporation, General Motors, and the Business Council, among others.It is also important to address how the mainstream media is intertwined, often covertly and secretly, with the government. Carl Bernstein, one of the two Washington Post reporters who covered the Watergate scandal, revealed that there were over 400 American journalists who had  secretly carried out assignments for the Central Intelligence Agency. Interestingly,  the use of journalists has been among the most productive means of intelligence-gathering employed by the CIA.  Among organizations which cooperated with the CIA were the  American Broadcasting Company, the National Broadcasting Company, the Associated Press, United Press International, Reuters, Hearst Newspapers, Scripps-Howard, Newsweek magazine, the Mutual Broadcasting System, the Miami Herald and the old Saturday Evening Post and New York Herald-Tribune. By far the most valuable of these associations, according to CIA officials, have been with the New York Times, CBS and Time Inc. The CIA even ran a training program  to teach its agents to be journalists,  who were  then placed in major news organizations with help from management. These types of relationships have continued in the decades since, although perhaps more covertly and quietly than before. For example, it was revealed in 2000 that during the NATO bombing of Kosovo,  several officers from the US Army s 4th Psychological Operations (PSYOPS) Group at Ft. Bragg worked in the news division at CNN s Atlanta headquarters.  This same Army Psyop outfit had  planted stories in the U.S. media supporting the Reagan Administration s Central America policies,  which was described by the Miami Herald as a  vast psychological warfare operation of the kind the military conducts to influence a population in enemy territory.  These Army PSYOP officers also worked at National Public Radio (NPR) at the same time. The US military has, in fact, had a strong relationship with CNN.In 2008, it was reported that the Pentagon ran a major propaganda campaign by using retired Generals and former Pentagon officials to present a good picture of the administration s war-time policies. The program started in the lead-up to the Iraq War in 2003 and continued into 2009. These officials, presented as  military analysts , regurgitate government talking points and often sit on the boards of military contractors, thus having a vested interest in the subjects they are brought on to  analyze. In 2013, Public Accountability reported:During the public debate around the question of whether to attack Syria, Stephen Hadley, former national security adviser to George W. Bush, made a series of high-profile media appearances. Hadley argued strenuously for military intervention in appearances on CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, and Bloomberg TV, and authored a Washington Post op-ed headlined To stop Iran, Obama must enforce red lines with Assad. In each case, Hadley s audience was not informed that he serves as a director of Raytheon, the weapons manufacturer that makes the Tomahawk cruise missiles that were widely cited as a weapon of choice in a potential strike against Syria. Hadley earns $128,500 in annual cash compensation from the company and chairs its public affairs committee. He also owns 11,477 shares of Raytheon stock, which traded at all-time highs during the Syria debate ($77.65 on August 23, making Hadley s share s worth $891,189). Despite this financial stake, Hadley was presented to his audience as an experienced, independent national security expert.The major philanthropic foundations in the United States have often used their enormous wealth to co-opt voices of dissent and movements of resistance into channels that are safe for the powers that be. As McGeorge Bundy, former President of the Ford Foundation once said,  Everything the Foundation does is to make the world safe for Capitalism. Examples of this include philanthropies like the Rockefeller Foundation, Ford Foundation and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation providing immense financial and organizational support to Non-Governmental Organizations. Furthermore, the alternative media are often funded by these same foundations, which has the effect of influencing the direction of coverage as well as the stifling of critical analysis Learn more about the Centre for Research on Globalization and the work of its founder and editor, Professor Michel Chossudovsky, as well how to donate to them at Global Research.ca.

8193, Colbert Grills Sanders On His ‘Revolution For America’ — Sanders’ Response Is Brilliant (VIDEO),"Senator Bernie Sanders made an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert a day following his landslide win in New Hampshire and he was riding high. Colbert resurrected his former conservative Colbert Report character, playing devil s advocate by grilling  the senator on his polices, even suggesting that he was promoting  class warfare.  Colbert said that trying to take power away from the 1% was not going to be easy.  I ll tell you how I know, I am in the top 1 percent.  Colbert also warned of revolution which Sanders advocates by quoting John F. Kennedy. He said: Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable. Sanders, however, rejected the idea that his revolution would go bad. He said: What the goal of this campaign is about is to look at the Civil Rights Movement, look at the women s movement, look at the gay movement, understand that when people come together we can accomplish enormous things. But I think what people are saying is enough is enough. We need fundamental changes in our political system and our economic system. Sanders is right. Thinking outside of the box is what creates both innovation and change and Sanders sums it up perfectly: We used to have a segregated society. African-Americans couldn t go to schools, couldn t drink at water fountains. Millions of people stood together and said,  Hey, enough is enough. That is not what America is supposed to be about. Americans are on board with Sanders  message. He s scored a resounding victory in New Hampshire, especially with America s youth, collecting 86% of the vote in the 18-24 age bracket.

6234, Trump Doesn’t Want His Supporters To Know His REAL Stance On Gun-Free Zones,"Donald Trump recently went after the gun nut vote in a hard way when he declared during the National Rifle Association s annual meeting on Friday that he, as president, would get rid of  gun-free zones.  Of course, Trump didn t mention during his pandering that many of the properties that he owns could be described as gun-free zones. He also just backtracked on the issue to a large degree, days after the meeting.An official with the Trump Organization told ABC News that there are  no restrictions on licensed individuals carrying in our hotels or golf clubs. That statement turns out to be completely false. Here is a rundown of properties that ABC News discovered that do, in fact, have restrictions on carrying guns. Mar-a-Lago, Trump s posh Florida club, doesn t allow guns, a hotel staff member told ABC News.Trump National Doral, in Miami, Florida, doesn t allow guns either, a security official told ABC News. The resort would  much rather not  have guns on the property, said a security official with the hotel, who noted that guns are  not to be carried on our property. We ve had guests that have brought them before,  he said, but those guns  had to remain in their safe the whole time in the room. A security worker at Trump National in Jupiter, Florida, said  no  when asked if guns were allowed on premises by citizens who are licensed to carry them. Asked about exceptions for people like off-duty cops, the staff member directed ABC News to a supervisor, who said the hotel had no comment at all on guns at the property.Trump International Golf Club in Palm Beach County, Florida, also doesn t allow citizens with concealed carry licenses to bring their guns on the property, a golf-shop worker told ABC News. Now, of course, these policies make sense. Who would want to go to a resort or golf club to relax only to be surrounded by insecure people carrying around firearms? The same could be said for any establishment. Why should the staff or patrons at a restaurant or retail store have to deal with the person who just walked in carrying an assault weapon?So, once again we find a clear disconnect between what Trump says and reality. Maybe Trump just wants to ban all gun free zones except those that are enacted on premises that primarily serve the wealthy? As he has recently stated in another attempt to pander to the  the second amendment is the only amendment that matters  crowd, Trump stated that he thinks that teachers should be able to carry firearms on school premises.Except that, since he Trump, he can t even seem to make up his mind on that matter. On Sunday, Trump was questioned about his stance on letting teachers carry firearms during an interview on Fox & Friends. That s where he stated that: I don t want to have guns in classrooms. Although, in some cases, teachers should have guns in classrooms. That means absolutely nothing and is a far cry from what he was preaching just a few days ago and his pledge he made in January when he said: I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools   you have to   and on military bases. My first day, it gets signed, OK? My first day. There s no more gun-free zones. Trump appears to be willing to spout any NRA talking point in an attempt to pander to anyone willing to be pandered to.  In some cases  does not in any way mean a blanket throwaway policy like he has been describing for most of his campaign. Instead, he now offers this ambivalent stance on a topic that impacts millions of lives.Featured image from (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)",News,"May 22, 2016"

4641, Former KKK Leader Thanks Trump’s VP For Being So Nice (AUDIO),"The most infamous leader of the Ku Klux Klan has just proven that the biggest bullies have the thinnest skins. Former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke, a Trump-loving white supremacist who spent a good chunk of his life leading a hate group, apparently doesn t like to be called bad names because it hurts his feelings.Duke let Americans in on his sensitive side when the ex-KKK leader spoke about the fact that Republican vice presidential nominee Mike Pence had held off on calling Duke names like  deplorable  (even though Pence has disavowed Duke s support, unlike his boss). In return for his kindness and compassion, Duke praised Pence extensively on his radio show for refusing the call Duke exactly what he is. Duke said: The whole idea that they were trying to make Pence call me names basically, and he didn t bite on that, was a real positive thing for all of us. The secret alliance between Duke and the Trump campaign is disgusting, and it has had disastrous effects. Because he was so inspired by Trump s racist and hateful presidential campaign, Duke is now running for the Senate   and why wouldn t he, when several Americans have been so accepting of the racist and anti-Semitic views that Trump holds as well? The Trump campaign has basically paved the way for people like Duke!You can listen to Duke rave about Pence below:The terrifying thing about Trump s campaign is that the GOP nominee has literally made it ok for hate speech and bigotry to be expressed publicly. He has, in many ways, normalized it in his campaign speeches, his violence-provoking rallies, and by sharing white supremacist and anti-minority messages on social media on a regular basis. Trump has made room for the most awful, divisive views to be expressed and given people like Duke the guts to have platforms they never would dared to pursue before. This is the America that Trump is creating   and it s not great. It s terrifying.Featured image via screenshot",News,"September 13, 2016"
4246, Hillary SHUTS DOWN Trump Supporters Calling Her Husband A Rapist At Rally (VIDEO),"Ever since Donald Trump got exposed through an audio tape leak for bragging about how he sexually assaults women, Trump supporters have been sticking up for their favorite misogynist more than ever.Following in the Republican nominee s footsteps, their only defense against the truth in those tapes is to put blame on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton s husband, former President Bill Clinton, for the rape allegations against him.Hillary is taking this all in stride, and is completely shutting down any Trump lovers who dare hijack her rallies and distract voters from focusing on moving America forward. During a rally with Al Gore in Florida today, Clinton s talk on climate change was interrupted by Trump supporters who were yelling about her husband being a rapist. Here s a video of one such supporter, who obviously refuses to acknowledge the fact that his own candidate has several rape cases against him, one involving a minor. For 2nd day in a row, a protester has interrupted HRC by yelling:  Bill Clinton is a rapist.

They re doing it because radio host Alex Jones is offering to give anyone who can get on camera and call Bill Clinton a rapist $5,000.

7609, Why Conservatives Should Stop Whining About President Obama Skipping Nancy Reagan’s Funeral,"This actually happens all the time no matter who the president is, but conservatives are throwing a tantrum because President Obama does it.On Sunday, former First Lady Nancy Reagan passed away at the age of 94. Tributes have since poured in from across the country, even from President Obama himself. Nancy Reagan once wrote that nothing could prepare you for living in the White House,  Obama said in a statement. She was right, of course. But we had a head start, because we were fortunate to benefit from her proud example, and her warm and generous advice. Our former First Lady redefined the role in her time here As somebody who is lucky enough to have an extraordinary partner in my life as well, I know how much she meant not just to President Reagan but to the country as a whole. He was lucky to have her. She will be missed. That doesn t exactly sound like a man who didn t personally like or respect Mrs. Reagan. But because President Obama has decided not to attend her funeral on Friday in order to stick to his already tight schedule, conservatives are freaking out and throwing hissy fits despite the fact that this is not new.While Presidents usually attend the funerals of former Presidents, they have historically skipped the funerals of other high ranking officials and First Ladies, often sending the current First Lady to represent them at the service. Michelle Obama is, in fact, attending Nancy Reagan s funeral.President Obama will be taking part in an interview in Texas at the South by Southwest Festival, where he is also scheduled to speak about civic engagement and using technology to address the challenges we face in the future. This was planned prior to Reagan s death.Yet, conservatives see this as a sign of disrespect. The only problem is that he is hardly the first president to skip a funeral for a former First Lady.For instance, President Clinton did not attend Pat Nixon s funeral in 1993 and President Bush did not attend Lady Bird Johnson s funeral in 2007. President Obama also did not attend Betty Ford s funeral in 2011.Jimmy Carter didn t attend Mamie Eisenhower s funeral in 1979 and Franklin D. Roosevelt did not attend Lou Henry Hoover s funeral in 1944.And if conservatives seriously want to refer to Obama as  President Petty,  they should know that Ronald Reagan did not attend Bess Truman s funeral in 1982, and keep in mind that she was First Lady when her husband President Harry Truman ushered in the end of World War II by ordering the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 and was the longest lived First Lady in American history.As far as I have been able to research, the only First Ladies whose funerals have been attended by a sitting President in the last 70 years was Eleanor Roosevelt in 1962 and Jacqueline Kennedy in 1994 by President John F. Kennedy and President Bill Clinton respectively.Roosevelt had wanted a small private funeral but Kennedy attended anyway because at the time of her death, Eleanor had been known as the beloved First Lady of the World who served as First Lady during the Great Depression and World War II and is still the longest serving First Lady in American history. Jacqueline Kennedy brought grace to the White House and became a symbol of strength for a traumatized nation after the assassination of her husband in 1963. President Clinton attended her funeral because he was a friend of the family and even delivered remarks at the burial.The bottom line here is that conservatives have nothing to gripe about on this issue. Nancy Reagan s funeral is also a private one and it is quite possible that President Obama was simply not invited to attend and the only reason Michelle Obama will be in attendance is because it is a long tradition that First Ladies attend the funerals of their predecessors just as Presidents attend the funerals of their predecessors.So, there is no reason at all for conservatives to whine about President Obama choosing not to attend Nancy Reagan s funeral. He is not the one being petty.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News,"March 9, 2016"
6717, Identities Of Arrested Anti-Racist Stone Mountain Protesters Released (VIDEO),"Authorities have released the identities of nine men who were arrested on April 23 during a clash between about a dozen white supremacist demonstrators, a group of counter-protesters and police in Stone Mountain, Georgia.According to WXIA, chaos broke out after a  pro-white  organization planned a rally at Stone Mountain Park on Saturday. The white supremacist group  Rock Stone Mountain  organized the demonstration to protest what they claim are  efforts to erase the white race. In response, a second group of counter-protesters called  All Out Atlanta  also staged a demonstration at the park.Only about two dozen white supremacists attended the protest, while counter protesters numbered somewhere between 200 and 300, according to local reports.Both groups were granted permits by park authorities.Police say the opposing protest groups were to be located in different areas of the park.Things went bad, however, when two members of the  pro-white  group got lost and ended up in the middle of the counter-demonstration.Police from three different agencies, dressed in riot gear, descended on the area.Video shows one of the men from the white supremacist organization referring to counter-protesters as  savages. Nine members of the counter-protest group were arrested.Eight were charged with the misdemeanor crime of  wearing a hood or mask. They were identified as:The ninth protester was identified as 21-year-old Joshua T. Taft. Taft is charged with Aggravated Assault.According to police, members of All Out Atlanta threw rocks and  got physical  with officers.Taft is accused of throwing a firework of some kind at police.Video of the arrest doesn t appear to show him resisting arrest or becoming physical with police.Here s more on the story from WXIA in Georgia.

1962, The Latest Delusion From Devin Nunes Will Make You SICK — This Is Exactly Why He Can’t Be Trusted,"Representative Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said on Wednesday that the Democrats are  not serious  about the investigation into Russia s interference in the 2016 presidential election. We re beginning to figure out who s actually serious about the investigation because it appears like the Democrats aren t really serious about this investigation,  he told reporters, according to Politico.This is the same Nunes who snuck onto the White House grounds to meet an unnamed source last week, then switched cars and ditched aides, then vanished into the night so that the next day he could make an announcement to defend alleged president Donald Trump. Nunes, while refusing to name his source, said that he had seen evidence that Trump associates were  incidentally  surveilled after the election.The top Democrat on the committee, Adam Schiff, and other Democrats, are calling for Nunes to recuse himself from the Russia probe. Nunes has refused to do so.Nunes alleges that the Democrats have not given him a witness list and added that as far as he knew they had done  very little  to read the documents provided by the intelligence agencies, according to Politico. So, at the end of the day here, we re going to get to the truth, we re going to find out who s actually doing a real investigation,  Nunes said.Nunes, who literally went around the very committee he chairs, to bring Trump  evidence  amid one of the biggest scandals to ever hit the White House, claims that Democrats aren t serious about a probe into Russia s meddling of our election.Sure, accuse the other side of what you re guilty of, Rep. Nunes.So far, only one Republican lawmaker has stepped forward to call for Nunes to recuse himself from the investigation. Hopefully, more Republicans will locate their conscience in order to disallow a hostile foreign government from underminding our election process in the future.Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images.",News,"March 29, 2017"

14235,“YOU’RE HIRED!” Trump Pulls Unemployed Vet From Audience And Hires Her On The Spot,"No matter which candidate you support, this moment on the campaign trail is pretty awesome. Trump has said he wants to support our veterans in a big way if elected. He showed he s a man of his word when he plucked a veteran from the crowd and hired her. Instead of his catchphrase  you re fired,  Mr. Trump told the previously homeless black woman,  You re hired. Just when you think the 2016 presidential race can t get more surreal, Donald Trump reprised his role from the hit realty TV show  The Apprentice  at Washington press conference Monday and plucked an unemployed veteran out of the audience for an impromptu job interview.It was yet another unexpected twist in Mr. Trump s unconventional run that has defied the pundits, confounded the GOP establishment and made him the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination.Mr. Trump summoned the Washington press corps to the under-construction Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, just blocks from the White House. He said the one way or another he s coming to the nation s capital.The billionaire businessman boasted that the hotel, which is being refurbished from the city s historic Old Post Office building, was being restored to the  highest level,  with luxurious suites and the largest ballroom in Washington.He said the hotel would open ahead of schedule and under budget in September.When hands went up from reporters gathered in the cavernous atrium where the hotel lobby was being built, Mr. Trump called on Alicia Watkins. HERE S THE ENCOUNTER BETWEEN TRUMP AND MS. WATKINS: Ms. Watkins, 38, a former Air Force staff sergeant who survived the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon and served in Iraq and Afghanistan, was at the press conference as a freelance writer working on an article about jobs for veterans.She briefly described her situation and complimented Mr. Trump s stance of expanding employment opportunities for veterans, and then asked if the hotel would be part of a jobs program. We are doing some of that. What are you looking for, what kind of position,  Mr. Trump asked, and then invited her to come to the podium.Pleased with her response, Mr. Trump directed her to one of his company s executives to work out a employment deal. If we can make a good deal on the salary, she s going to probably have this job,  said the real estate tycoon.Asked why he did the on-the-spot job interview, Mr. Trump said that he  felt good about her. It s a gut instinct,  he said.  I have instincts about people. Read more of this incredible story at: Washington Times ",politics,"Mar 21, 2016"
13829,NOT KIDDING: DEMOCRATS Are Calling For Obama To Be Hillary’s Running Mate…But Is That Legal?,"Not that the word  legal  means anything to either one of them Because Hillary Clinton is white and no longer young, a strain of political thought holds that she might lack Barack Obama s inherent appeal to new and minority voters and thus that she won t be able to ride the Democratic party s demographic advantages to easy victory in 2016.Writing for the Washington Examiner, Philip Klein ably sketches the nightmare scenario for liberals.  If Hillary s performance among black voters retreats to more typical Democratic levels,  he writes,  it will hinder her efforts in swing states such as Ohio and Florida, where Democrats need to rack up huge margins in urban areas to make up for their weaknesses in other parts of the states.   It s questionable that young voters will flock to vote at historically high levels for a 69-year-old white woman who has been a national political figure since before many of them were born. The nightmare for conservatives is a complementary scenario in which Clinton holds the Obama coalition together without issue and simultaneously increases Democratic margins among women and whites. In that world, she defeats her opponent by greater margins than Obama defeated John McCain and Mitt Romney. But there s no reason to assume that outcome is any more likely than the one Klein alluded to. And there s also no reason Democrats should tinker with a winning formula. If Clinton can turn out Obama s voters, she will win.The challenge, then, is to make sure Clinton s age and ethnicity don t discourage Obama s youthful, diverse supporters from turning out in November 2016. Fortunately, there s an easy way to make sure that doesn t happen. Clinton simply has to select Barack Obama as her running mate.LOL, you might be thinking. Obama can t be the vice president. That would place him at the top of the line of succession, and the Constitution limits him to two terms. Clinton would end up in court before she ended up in the White House if she pulled something like that.I ll grant that if Democrats nominate Barack Obama to be their vice presidential candidate next year, it would be somewhat controversial. But here Democrats can borrow tactically from the literal-minded conservatives who have seized on syntactic oddities to unravel Obama s domestic agenda. As a purely textual matter, the Constitution merely prohibits Obama from being elected to a third term. It doesn t necessarily prohibit him from actually being president again, should Hillary Clinton no longer be able to serve. And were he on the ticket, Clinton s potential liabilities with Obama loyalists would disappear.As hot takes go, this one is significantly more piping than, say, the idea that Al Gore should challenge Hillary for the nomination. My guru for this argument is Cornell University law professor Michael Dorf, though others have examined the issue, as well.There are three sections of the Constitution that prescribe limits on who can be president and vice president: Article II, the Twelfth Amendment and the Twenty-Second Amendment. While the former two limit who is  eligible  to serve natural born citizens, 35 or older the Twenty-Second Amendment begins  No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice. Whether its adopters intended it or not, the plain language of the Twenty-Second amendment doesn t prohibit a former two-term president from succeeding a sitting president and serving out the remainder of her term. It merely prohibits him from running for a third. By using the term  elected  instead of  eligible,  its authors created a loophole large enough for a Clinton-Obama ticket to coast to victory through. Via: New Republic ",politics,"May 25, 2016"
22676,FBI Release Oregon Video Footage Depicting Death of Robert Lavoy Finicum – But Questions Remain,"21st Century Wire says..UPDATE 1-29-2016 at 01:30PM ET: Due to public pressure and intense speculation about the events of Tuesday brought on by a YouTube recording of the testimony of key eyewitness Victoria Sharp, the FBI has released the unedited aerial video footage from Tuesday evening s incident which took place along Highway 395. According to the official FBI statement:  We feel that it is necessary to show the whole thing unedited in the interest of transparency.  The FBI video entitled,  Complete, Unedited Video of Joint FBI and OSP Operation 01/26/2016 , does show the victim Lavoy Finicum exiting the truck awkwardly in at least two feet of snow, and he clearly does not  charge towards  the SWAT team, and his hands are clearly held high above his head as he exits his truck when confronted by a SWAT team, before being shot multiple times by marksmen and falling in the snow. Also, the scale and size of this operation is very evident by the footage, and the apprehension of the protesters was not the result of a mere  traffic stop  as it was wrongly characterized in multiple mainstream media reports.The FBI has also titled their release as  unedited  which shows a window of 26 min and 29 seconds, but it would be interesting to see any drone footage prior to where their clip begins, to further determine how long the drone was filming the vehicles of Finicum and Bundy. This is important because it would shed further light the premeditated nature of the confrontation that the media and government  sources  have called a  traffic stop . On its own, this FBI drone footage would appear to support previous government and media claims by CNN, Washington Post and others that the victim was indeed  reaching towards his waistband  which gave federal and state police justification to unleash deadly force. However, it is still not completely clear from this aerial footage whether or not Finicum was holstered (he is said to normally carry a gun on the right hip, but FBI are claiming he had a 9mm gun in his inside left breast pocket), but also whether or not he lowered his arms before, or after he was shot multiple times. For example, if Finicum had his hands in the air and was then was shot in the abdomen first, then any man s natural reaction would be to then lower his hand(s) and clutch the wound. Additionally, if any shots were fired, even in the vicinity, then confusion could have ensued which might have prompted Finicum to reach for his weapon. Either way, it is impossible to make any such a forensic determination without a corresponding audio track  which would help to determine if any shots were fired before Finicum s hand(s) could be seen lowering.  WARNING: The following images depict violence and death which some readers may find disturbing. Watch:Watch the edited version here:  Finicum appears to temporarily lose his balance in the snow at the very moment he looks to be hit by agents.What is clear however from this video is that armed agents did not shoot to disable their suspect, but shot to kill and even had a laser sight trained on him for many minutes after he was downed. Clearly, multiple SWAT shooters could be seen emerging from the woods. After killing Finicum, police then left the victim to bleed to death laying in the snow and did not check on him for at least another 8 minutes.Flash-bang rounds can be seen around the 14:00 mark of the FBI s  unedited  version, and the FBI has said that it fired CS gas and  non lethal rounds  (possibly pepper spray rounds, or rubber bullets) are said to have been fired at the truck while the passengers were inside. This begs the question: with nonlethal rounds already in play   why did multiple SWAT shooters use so many deadly rounds against Finicum when he exited the truck with his hands up?READ MORE OREGON STANDOFF NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Oregon Files",US_News,"January 29, 2016"
22226,FAKE NEWS WEEK: Electronic Voting – The Big Lie That Just Won’t Die,"  In response to the establishment media s contrived  fake news  crisis designed to marginalise independent and alternative media sources of news and analysis, 21WIRE is running its own #FakeNewsWeek awareness campaign, where each day our editorial team at 21st Century Wire will feature media critiques and analysis of mainstream corporate media coverage of current events   exposing the government and the mainstream media as the real purveyors of  fake news  throughout modern history . Mark Anderson 21st Century WireThe U.S. government, the  intelligence  community and their malicious mainstream-media partners in deception just won t let it go.The underhanded U.S. unitary state, which seeks a unipolar world with the U.S. in charge, still says in its  never ending story  that omniscient, omnipresent Russian leader Vladimir Putin masterminded hacking the computerized systems of U.S. elections as well as Democratic National Committee computers.Then, as the stale tale goes, Russia handed all the resulting electronic juicy tidbits over to Wikileaks, which turned around and dropped a veritable information bomb on America s delicate democracy.But while that  bomb  allegedly influenced enough people to vote for the winner Donald Trump and not for loser Hillary Clinton, to this day, according to big media, we re supposed to forget all about the creepy, damning, criminally inclined things contained in the Podesta-Clinton emails themselves.So, let s try and grasp this media-massaged, intel-infused message: Even though the emails apparently had enough sizzle and scandal to boost one presidential candidate over another, we re still prodded to think that the information in the emails somehow isn t the issue even though the content of the emails will always be what matters the most.Also notice what no one, and certainly no media outlet, dares to mention regarding the other half of this issue: If Putin also was crafty enough to hack into the actual state-level U.S. election systems, then this implies that U.S. elections systems can be hacked in the first place.This is huge. Think about it the next time you use an electronic  ES&S Ivotronic touchscreen voting machine or Hart InterCivic s model at the polls.All along, we ve been reassured that the electronic voting systems used in about 95% of American voting precincts are The Greatest Thing Ever Invented and Monumentally Secure Are they really? THE ELECTORAL INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX: Securing America s automated voting systems has become a complicated affair. And, all along, writers like Yours Truly, highly credible Texas vote-reform activists like Laura Pressley, Vickie Karp, Bev Harris and others have uncovered tons of evidence that electronic elections are an immensely deceptive and vulnerable apparatus   vulnerable to external hacking and also to being  fixed  from the inside without any need for outside hacking, through the proprietary software inside the these voting contraptions that can be pre-set to steal elections if the need arises.You re going to want to see my interview with Laura Pressley, on behalf of American Free Press, through this link right here.THE RUSSIAN DISTRACTION As Pressley shows in detail, the integrity and lawfulness of Texas elections are in serious peril   not because of any outside  autocrats  like Putin and his supposed cyberspace minions, but because of state and local election officials, right here in the U.S., who absolutely will not follow state election law. And the average TV or newspaper reporter is utterly tone-deaf to these problems, which keeps the people in perpetual fog, unaware that U.S. elections have been effectively privatized by those who make the machines that count the votes.To hear more about this  Putin the Hacker  debacle, please listen to my Dec. 29, 2016 interview with UK-based radio host Andrew Carrington Hitchcock on his regularly scheduled American Free Press (AFP) show.Furthermore, check out this Election Night Gatekeepers overview on my blog by election-theft expert Jim Condit Jr., who worked with the late Collier brothers in their game-changing book,  Votescam.  The media is part of a secretive consortium that counts the vote in secret, meaning the mainstream press  fake news carries with it evidence of criminal collusion.The unavoidable conclusion is that the powers-that-be   in going after Putin and calling him The Supreme Hacker of the Known Universe  have shot themselves in the foot because they re clearly and finally admitting in the process that U.S. voting systems CAN be hacked, after more than a decade of denial.This means that all their denials about electronic election fraud are invalidated.  The critics of electronic election systems are right. The establishment is wrong. End of discussion.Meanwhile, recalling some recent history, Wayne Madsen Reports provided some important perspective: Although the Central Intelligence Agency has had a long history of undermining presidents-elect and prime ministers-elect in other countries, the United States has never witnessed the intelligence agency so blatantly attempting to politically weaken a U.S. president-elect [Trump] just a few weeks prior to the inauguration. What the CIA is doing in forcing Donald Trump into shifting from his campaign promise of restoring good relations with Russia to one of outright hostility to Moscow   favored by the CIA, Director of National Intelligence (DNI), and the neo-conservatives within the Republican and Democratic Party establishments  is nothing less than an overt threat to American democracy. WHERE ARE THE CYBER-COPS?And, as American Free Press reported in its first 2017 edition, the young owner of a Russian-based web-server company may have a handle on who stole sensitive electronic communications between Hillary Clinton and some of her advisors.But 26-year-old Vladimir Fomenko knows one thing for sure: U.S. intelligence, which professes to be hot on the trail of exposing Russian hacking, doesn t seem to care about his story.This means that our leaders in Washington have long ignored a solid lead that could prove once and for all whether or not the Russian government hacked the computers systems of top Democrats and U.S. elections systems.Fomenko recently spoke to AFP to try and demystify the controversy surrounding his King Servers company and the cyberattacks purportedly carried out at the behest of Russia.AFP writer John Friend, quoting Fomenko, noted that even though his servers were exploited in this cyber-crime:  No U.S. law enforcement or intelligence agency is interested in speaking with him to gather real evidence on the perpetrators. The U.S. was not the only country hit by computer hackers. Hackers evidently targeted Germany, Turkey, and Ukraine, apparently attempting to upset democratic processes.It was when WikiLeaks began releasing hacked data from the DNC late this past summer that media reports and the Clinton campaign began blaming Russia with no solid evidence to support that assertion.After learning about this shadowy criminal activity, Fomenko immediately shut down the servers and looked into the situation. He says he s willing to cooperate with law enforcement. We pursued an investigation without delay and found some tracks leading to Europe,  Fomenko told AFP. Web hosting is a legal enterprise  . . . regulated by law,  Fomenko added.  King Servers works in Russia, the U.S., and the Netherlands and complies with the laws of these countries. Fomenko stressed:  No U.S. law enforcement agency has contacted us at this time. Neither the FBI nor any other U.S., Russian, or Dutch intelligence agency has contacted us. The plot thickens WSB-TV Channel 2 reporters in Atlanta, Georgia actually did their job and noted:  The Georgia Secretary of State s office now confirms 10 different cyberattacks on its network all trace back to U.S. Department of Homeland Security IP addresses. Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, dissatisfied with the federal government s dodgy explanation about these DHS cyberattacks, fired off a letter to then-President-elect Donald Trump to put him in the loop.So, it ll be interesting to see if Trump ever helps Georgia, and other states whose election systems were supposedly hacked, figure out what happened and who s really responsible.After all this time, the accusation that Russia  did it  still looks less and less credible, as this additional AFP piece outlines, yet the American establishment, thinking it could blame Russia to explain Hillary s loss and come to grips with Trump s win, just won t drop the blame-Putin narrative.We can only hope that Trump s claim that he ll start putting some limits on our out-of-control spy agencies will come true. If ever there was a good reason to pursue those limits, this high-level U.S. intelligence gambit to blame Putin, no matter what, is it. The orthodox press has been a solid ally all along of these intel-intrigues.And this gives Trump a chance to prove he s the real deal, and not another asset of the establishment, despite his seemingly honest intentions to name names and seek real solutions to the real problems that are troubling Americans and citizens across the world.For, if elections are not really a means to find and assign better leaders who will use their victory as a mandate to do the right thing for the voters, then what s the point of having elections at all, hacked or not hacked, honest or not?Author Mark Anderson is an investigative journalist and features writer for American Free Press, and is editor of The Truth Hound.

(See video below)A worker caught in a machine at a meat processing plant has died in Ohio, according to local authorities.Samuel Martinez, 62, was killed by the machine on Saturday afternoon at the Fresh Mark plant in Canton, Ohio.The  Guatemalan national  died at the scene.According to the Stark County Coroner s Office, the man stepped into a chute and was stuck in the waste grinder.In a statement released on Saturday, Fresh Mark said that they would work with local law enforcement to figure out what caused the accident.This afternoon just before 5 pm, we experienced a work-related fatality at our Canton facility, they said. Our primary concern rests with the wellbeing of this employee s family, as well as with the safety and well-being of all our employees in the Canton and other Fresh Mark facilities. We are working with authorities to determine the facts regarding this incident. The incident marks the second of such to happen at the company.In 2011, an employee was electrocuted while trying to plug in a fan as he was standing in water.The company sells pork related meat under the Superior and Sugardale brands.  Daily Mail In 2011, Steve Salvi, the founder of Ohio Jobs & Justice PAC interviewed an Ohio worker that made some startling allegations regarding the alleged hiring of underaged illegal aliens at one of Fresh Mark s Sugardale meatpacking plants in Canton, Ohio. In addition to outing the company for hiring underage illegal alien workers, the former Fresh Mark employee claims a veteran returned from Iraq and applied for a job at the meat processing company. The veteran was allegedly turned down until he could prove that he spoke the Spanish language.In May 2017, the very liberal New Yorker published a story about a 17-year old Guatemalan boy who was too young to work in a factory, and lost his leg due to the unsafe working conditions at neighboring Case Farms in Ohio. The New Yorker says the Case Farms plants are among the most dangerous workplaces in America.Osiel sanitized the liver-giblet chiller, a tublike contraption that cools chicken innards by cycling them through a near-freezing bath, then looked for a ladder, so that he could turn off the water valve above the machine. As usual, he said, there weren t enough ladders to go around, so he did as a supervisor had shown him: he climbed up the machine, onto the edge of the tank, and reached for the valve. His foot slipped; the machine automatically kicked on. Its paddles grabbed his left leg, pulling and twisting until it snapped at the knee and rotating it a hundred and eighty degrees, so that his toes rested on his pelvis. The machine  literally ripped off his left leg,  medical reports said, leaving it hanging by a frayed ligament and a five-inch flap of skin. Osiel was rushed to Mercy Medical Center, where surgeons amputated his lower leg.Case Farms plants are among the most dangerous workplaces in America. In 2015 alone, federal workplace-safety inspectors fined the company nearly two million dollars, and in the past seven years, it has been cited for two hundred and forty violations. That s more than any other company in the poultry industry except Tyson Foods, which has more than thirty times as many employees. David Michaels, the former head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), called Case Farms  an outrageously dangerous place to work.  Four years before 17 year old Guatemalan worker, Osiel L pez P rez lost his leg, Michaels s inspectors had seen Case Farms employees standing on top of machines to sanitize them and warned the company that someone would get hurt. Just a week before Osiel s accident, an inspector noted in a report that Case Farms had repeatedly taken advantage of loopholes in the law and given the agency false information.  The company has a twenty-five-year track record of failing to comply with federal workplace-safety standards,  Michaels said.Case Farms has built its business by recruiting some of the world s most vulnerable immigrants, who endure harsh and at times illegal conditions that few Americans would put up with. When these workers have fought for higher pay and better conditions, the company has used their immigration status to get rid of vocal workers, avoid paying for injuries, and quash dissent. Thirty years ago, Congress passed an immigration law mandating fines and even jail time for employers who hire unauthorized workers, but trivial penalties and weak enforcement have allowed employers to evade responsibility. Under President Obama, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agreed not to investigate workers during labor disputes. Advocates worry that President Trump, whose Administration has targeted unauthorized immigrants, will scrap those agreements, emboldening employers to simply call ice anytime workers complain.",left-news,"Dec 17, 2017"
16950,HOW THE FBI Cracked A Terror Plot On Black Friday That May Have Been Worse Than 9-11," The U.S. is the great enemy of mankind!  raved Ernesto  Che  Guevara in 1961.  Against those hyenas there is no option but extermination. We will bring the war to the imperialist enemies  very home, to his places of work and recreation. The imperialist enemy must feel like a hunted animal wherever he moves. Thus we ll destroy him! We must keep our hatred against them (the U.S.) alive and fan it to paroxysms!  -Che Guevara, head of Cuba s  Foreign Liberation Department,  Nov. 17, 1962We have a president who won t tie Islamic terrorists to Islam, has cut a one-sided deal with Iran, as they continue to chant  death to America,  and has made an open alliance with a communist country who has a long history of hating America. The same country Obama is fighting to normalize relations with, would have committed an unspeakable act of terrorism against us, had our FBI not thwarted their plans.  Why the rush to embrace so many nations and leaders who have a long history of wanting to harm us Barry?  On the morning of November 17th, 1962, FBI headquarters in Washington D.C. took on  all the trappings of a military command post,  according to historian William Breuer. The previous night an intelligence puzzle had finally come together. The resulting picture staggered the FBI men. And these had served at their posts during WWII and the height of the Cold War. They d seen plenty. Now they had mere days to foil a crime against their nation to rival Hideki Tojo s.The agents and officers were haggard and red-eyed  but seriously wired. Like hawks on a perch they d been watching the plot unfold, sweating bullets the whole time. It was nearing time to swoop down on Fidel Castro and Che Guevara s agents, busy with a terror plot that would have made ISIS drool decades later.Alan Belmont was second to J Edgar Hoover at the time. Raymond Wannall headed the Bureau s Intelligence Division. That nerve-jangling morning both were in Belmont s office just down the hall from Hoover s. Both were burning up the telephone lines to their agents in New York. On one phone they had Special Agent John Malone who ran the New York field office. On other lines they talked with several carloads of FBI agents slinking around Manhattan. These were keeping a touch-and-go, but more or less constant, surveillance on the ringleaders of the Cuban terror plot.Castro s agents had targeted Macy s, Gimbels, Bloomingdales, and Manhattan s Grand Central Station with a dozen incendiary devices and 500 kilos of TNT. The holocaust was set for detonation the following week, on the day after Thanksgiving.A little perspective: For their March 2004 Madrid subway blasts, all 10 of them, that killed and maimed almost 2,000 people, al-Qaeda used a grand total of 100 kilos of TNT. Castro and Che s agents planned to set off five times that explosive power in the three biggest department stores on earth, all packed to suffocation and pulsing with holiday cheer on the year s biggest shopping day. Macy s get s 50,000 shoppers that one day. Thousands of New Yorkers, including women and children actually, given the date and targets, probably mostly women and children were to be incinerated and entombed. ( We greeted each other as old friends,  gushed Jimmy Carter when visiting Fidel Castro in 2002.)At the time, the FBI relied heavily on  HUMINT  (Human Intelligence.) So they d expertly penetrated the plot. One by one the ringleaders were ambushed. The first was named Roberto Santiesteban and he was nabbed while walking down Riverside Drive. As the agents closed in, Santiesteban saw them and  took off! And as he ran, Santiesteban was jamming paper in his mouth and chewing furiously.But six FBI agents were after him, all fleet of foot themselves. Finally they closed the ring and  triangulated  the suspect. Santiesteban fell, raging and cursing, flailing his arms and jabbing his elbows like a maniac. They grabbed his arm and bent it behind his back just as he was reaching for his pistol.While this group got their man, another FBI squad arrested a couple named Elsa Montero and Jose Gomez-Abad as they left their apartment on West 71st Street. The FBI speculated that as many as 30 others might have been in on the plot, but these were the head honchos. Had those detonators gone off, 9/11 might be remembered as the SECOND deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil.Some of these plotters belonged to the New York Chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, an outfit that became MUCH better known a year later on that very week. Incidentally, at the time of the Manhattan terror plot, the Fair Play For Cuba Committee also included among its members, CBS correspondent Robert Taber (an early version of Dan Rather, who conducted Castro s first network television soft-soaping on Aug. 30, 1957), along with The Nation magazine co-owner Alan Sagner. In 1996 President Clinton appointed Alan Sagner head of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.Terror-plotters Roberto Santiesteban, Elsa Montero and Jose Gomez-Abad belonged to the Castro-Cuban Mission to the U.N. and escaped prosecution by indignantly claiming  diplomatic immunity.  Via: TownhallIt s hard to imagine any American would ever consider Che Guevara to be a hero And then again, maybe it s not so hard to imagine:Maria Isabel is the campaign volunteer who hung this Che Guevara poster in the Obama campaign office in Houston, TX. She s no  low-level  volunteer either. She is a campaign  precinct captain  and the co-chair of the Houston Obama Leadership Team. ",Government News,"Nov 28, 2015"
5456, Right-Wing Firefighter Suspended After HORRIFIC Threat To Barack Obama (SCREENSHOTS),"It s like a day doesn t go by without some backwoods, right-wing jackass threatening the life of the President.Donald Baker of the Anchorage Fire Department was suspended after issuing threats to the President on social media. The controversy began when a reader sent a screenshot of the remark to WHAS11. Under an article titled Obama Hijacks Memorial With Sick Message  (apparently from right-wing garbage pile America s Freedom Fighters), Baker wrote that someone should  please put a bullet in this f*cker s head,  referring to  worthless piece of sh*t  Obama:When the station contacted Baker s employer, an investigation was launched. Chief William Rockwood confirmed on Thursday that the post was being investigated, and that he had suspended Baker while he determines if the department s social media policy was violated by this direct threat to the President: The Anchorage Fire Protection District finds this post extremely troubling and inappropriate. The District does not condone or allow the use of inappropriate conduct or language by its employees in person or through instant technology. Sadly, Baker is finding a lot of support on WHAS11 s Facebook page:   Some of his more vocal supporters have their own thoughts on the President:  Perhaps it s time for the Secret Service to pay Mr. Baker a visit. All too often we see threats against the President go completely unanswered   a dangerous thing when right-wing terrorism is on the rise.At minimum, Baker should definitely lose his job. After all, can he really be trusted to do his job to the best of his ability if he pulls up to a fire at a house with Democratic political signs in the yard? How deep does his bigotry go? Does it extend to all African-Americans? We are still awaiting the results of the  investigation,  but hopefully the Department does the right thing. Free speech is important, but it can and does have consequences.Featured image via screengrab",News,"July 16, 2016"
2004, Trump Staff Hangs Absurdly Offensive Abraham Lincoln Banner In Mar-A-Lago Dining Room,"A few years ago, teenage pop star Justin Bieber angered many people by commenting that he thought Holocaust victim Anne Frank would have been a  belieber.  Today, the 70-year-old President of the United States and his enablers pulled a similarly bone-headed stunt. Bieber was 19 at the time. What s Trump s excuse?Visitors to Trump s Mar-a-Lago resort were shocked to find that over the weekend, his staff hung banners  honoring  Abraham Lincoln by photoshopping a  Make America Great Again  trucker hat onto the former president s head.This is genuinely hanging in Mar-a-Lago for a dinner honoring Lincoln  pic.twitter.com/sRQLtjwBi4  B (@bXbyrne) March 25, 2017The banner went up in conjunction with a Republican Party of Palm Beach County dinner to celebrate  Lincoln Day.  Honoring Lincoln apparently didn t include celebrating his actual accomplishments, but connecting him to Donald Trump.They were so proud of this feat of egomania that they distributed the picture in the dinner program as well.The cover of the 2017 Lincoln Day Dinner program for Republican Party of Palm Beach County tonight at Mar-a-Lago. @WPTV pic.twitter.com/SJPlB8V6qb  Andrew Lofholm (@AndrewLofholm) March 24, 2017The only person who might find this stunt in good taste is Donald Trump   who recently learned that Abraham Lincoln was a Republican. Great president. Most people don t even know he was a Republican. Right? Does anyone know? A lot of people don t know that. We have to build that up a little more. The Florida Republicans hosting the dinner (which, itself, is probably an ethics violation due to the fact that the current president owns the resort and will profit from it) seemed to take Trump s idea and run with it.That s an awfully big dose of wishful thinking. While it s impossible to know what a man who has been dead for 152 years would make of modern life, the idea that he would enthusiastically endorse a race-baiting grifter like Donald Trump is hard to picture. Trump couldn t even get a single living president to support him. Adding to that, the fact that Lincoln is widely regarded as perhaps America s greatest orator only makes it more unlikely that he would be impressed by a guy who can barely string two sentences together coherently.I mean, seriously  look at this garbage: Look, having nuclear my uncle was a great professor and scientist and engineer, Dr. John Trump at MIT; good genes, very good genes, OK, very smart, the Wharton School of Finance, very good, very smart you know, if you re a conservative Republican, if I were a liberal, if, like, OK, if I ran as a liberal Democrat, they would say I m one of the smartest people anywhere in the world it s true! but when you re a conservative Republican they try oh, do they do a number. It s not exactly  Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. If Lincoln were alive today, he would probably have a really articulate, beautiful way of saying  Donald Trump, go screw yourself.  I ll have to settle for saying it as plainly as that.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"March 25, 2017"
20828,"MI BOARD OF EDUCATION Will Allow Students To Choose Gender, Bathroom, Locker Room And Even A New Name With No Parental Consent","Every parent in the United States of America should be alarmed by this covert attempt by Board of Education members to essentially tell our kids that their power supersedes that of the parents. Furthermore, this reckless policy of placing same sex kids in bathrooms and locker rooms puts children in danger of being in private spaces with sexual predators and or sexual offenders Make sure to add your comments to the MI Board of Educations HEREMichigan s State Board of Education has drafted a guidance that would push the state s schools to allow all students, regardless of parental or doctoral input, to choose their gender, name, pronouns, and bathrooms.Spearheaded by board president John C. Austin and signed by state superintendent Brian Whiston, the guidance informs Michigan public schools that only the students themselves i.e. not their parents or doctors can determine what their individual gender identities are. The responsibility for determining a student s gender identity rests with the student. Outside confirmation from medical or mental health professionals, or documentation of legal changes, is not needed,  the guidance states.Gender identity is defined in the guidance as  a person s deeply held internal sense or psychological knowledge of their own gender, regardless of the biological sex they were assigned at birth. Notably, the guidance makes no mention of a student s age affecting whether or not they can pick a gender without their parent or doctor.In fact, the guidance seems to intentionally cut parents out of the process.The guidance states:  School staff should address students by their chosen name and pronouns that correspond to their gender identity, regardless of whether there has been a legal name change. Students can even ask to have their chosen name and gender  included in the district s information management systems, in addition to the student s legal name. But what about when school staff members are speaking with parents about their son or daughter?The guidance states that  Transgender and GNC [gender nonconforming] students have the right to decide when, with whom, and to what extent to share private information. Accordingly, the board makes clear,  When contacting the parent/guardian of a transgender or GNC student, school staff should use the student s legal name and the pronoun corresponding to the student s assigned sex at birth, unless the student or parent/guardian has specified otherwise. In other words, a boy named  Jake  could become a girl named  Jane  at school, seemingly without his parents ever knowing.Names, pronouns, and genders aren t the only things the board wants students to choose.The guidance informs schools that  Students should be allowed to use the restroom in accordance with their gender identity. And the board makes clear that single-stall bathrooms are not inclusive enough:  Alternative and non-stigmatizing options, such as an all-gender or singleuser restroom (e.g., staff bathroom or nurse s office), should be made available to students who request them, but not presented as the only option. Locker rooms also should become inclusive of students  many gender identities.  A student should not be required to use a locker room that is incongruent with their gender identity,  the guidance states.  Locker room usage should be determined on a case-by-case basis, using the guiding principles of safety and honoring the student s gender identity and expression. Students who are bothered by having members of the opposite sex in their locker rooms can request  an adjusted changing schedule  or  use of a private area in the facility. The board quietly issued the statement and guidance on February 23rd, without a press release. The public has only until April 11th to comment on the proposed guidance, according to the Department of Education website. The board will finalize the guidance at a meeting on May 10th.

8668, Hilarious: Trevor Noah Has More Fun Than One Guy Should With Last Week’s Debates (VIDEO),"Another huge crowd of Americans tuned in last week as the Republicans held their latest fear-fest, also known as a debate. Refusing to acknowledge that so many people have been tuning in to watch them make fools of themselves and to see what Donald Trump will say next, the GOP field of freaks took the opportunity to once again go at each other s throats for at least half of the debate while invoking fear and bashing Hillary Clinton for the other half.On the flip side, the Democratic debate   held at 9PM on a Sunday night after a long day of playoff football   drew a tenth of the audience but had a thousand times the substance. As the GOP remains focused on having Americans clutch their guns while watching out the front window for ISIS to come knocking on their doors, the Democrats were firmly planted in the world of domestic policy, discussing things that the next president will have the pleasure of dealing with here at home.Both debates had desirable outcomes. The Republicans continued making fools of themselves, alienating more independent voters in the process, in two and a half hours of Clinton bashing, fear-mongering nonsense while the Democrats finally got to see the candidates bear their teeth while Martin O malley interrupted every so often to spread his vision of a world where tree-hugging liberals will stand next to Ammon Bundy for the betterment of humanity.No matter who you support, there was plenty of material from both debates to go around.

12065,OBAMA’S EMBARRASSING Farewell Interview: Mom Was “Hippie” But Shaved Her Legs…Promises To Take 5-Star Mooch On “Nice Vacation…She Deserves It”,"We all know the rules are a little different for the political class. But Michelle Obama s trips overseas hardly qualify as official business. They are lavish, extravagant, and excessive by any reasonable metric. Moreover, these latest revelations are hardly isolated.They are part of continuum reaching back across to the earliest days of the Obama administration. Recently, Judicial Watch obtained flight expense records from the U.S. Department of the Air Force revealing that Michelle Obama s June 2015 trip to the United Kingdom and Italy, accompanied by her daughters and mother, cost the taxpayers $240,495.67 in flight expenses alone.The records were released in response to a Freedom of Information (FOIA) request filed on June 22, 2015. The flights to London, England; and Milan, Venice, and Vicenza, Italy, for the June 15   21, 2015, trip totaled 20:35 hours at the cost of $11,684 per hour, bringing the flight expense total to $240,495.67, according to the Air Force documents.The Obama White House, true to form, tried spin the trip as a public service that was part of Michelle Obama s campaign to push her  Let Girls Learn  initiative and  Let s Move  anti-obesity campaign.Good grief. Everyone should deny themselves and streamline their lifestyles except for the Obamas.Press reports make it evident the Obama entourage set aside substantial time for tourism. In London, Michelle Obama joined Prince Harry for afternoon tea at Kensington Palace.And the White House press office conceded that, while in Italy,  The First Lady will also visit cultural sites in Venice before returning to Washington, D.C. Judicial Watch released records revealing significant taxpayer-funded travel expenses for a Michelle Obama trip in July. Those records from the U.S. Department of the Air Force showed that Michelle Obama s 2014 trip to China cost American taxpayers $362,523.53 in travel expenses alone. Mrs. Obama, her daughters, and her mother spent March 19   26 in China, in a trip highlighted by extended visits to some of the country s most popular tourist sites.Apparently, the Obama family continues to bill the taxpayers for costly tourism jaunts thinly disguised as humanitarian crusades. If Michelle Obama wants to take tea with Prince Harry or enthuse over Da Vinci s The Last Supper, she is certainly entitled to do so, but not at taxpayer expense.Since the beginning of Barack Obama s administration, the Obamas have become increasingly notorious for unnecessary, luxurious travel, under the guise of official business.NewsmaxPresident Obama admitted he cried at a recent senior staff send-off dinner   and is now claiming that he d be able to get re-elected if he had run for president again. I am confident in this vision because I m confident that if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could ve mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,  Obama said in a  The Axe Files  podcast interview by former aide David Axelrod. I know that in conversations that I ve had with people around the country, even some people who disagreed with me, they would say,  The vision, the direction that you point towards is the right one,  the outgoing president said.The Constitution limits a president to serving only two terms.Reflecting on his presidency, Obama said he s been inspired by the  heart  and  idealism  of his staff. We had our senior staff dinner   I got through about four minutes of the thing and started getting the hanky out,  he admitted.Obama said it feels like the  band  is breaking up, but that he wants to devote his post-presidency to growing the  talent  and vision that began in his two terms as president of the United States. Overall, this place never got cynical,  he said, praising the many aides he s had over the years. We never had that fire snuffed out. That is a point of pride for me,  he added.The podcast interview at times got personal, with Obama discussing his upbringing and talking about how his mom was a  hippie. But she always insisted on shaving her legs,  he told his former aide.The president also looked forward to leaving the White House, saying he s going to take his wife, Michelle, on a  nice  vacation because  she deserves it. The first family is currently in Hawaii for a two-week break before Inauguration Day on Jan. 20.  NYP ",politics,"Dec 26, 2016"
4449, RESULTS ARE IN: New Post-Debate Poll Shows MAJOR Swing In Very Key Demographic (VIDEO),"It s been a couple days since the first presidential debate, but the results are finally in, and it s not looking too great for one of the two candidates, especially in regards to the women vote.According to the new post-debate  NBC News/SurveyMonkey poll: Twenty-seven percent of likely women voters said the debate made them think worse of Trump. Meanwhile, nearly a third, or 30 percent, said their opinion of Clinton had improved, compared to 22 percent of men. Women were also far likelier to say Clinton won the debate, by a 10-point margin over men. It seems as if a lot of women are really put off by Donald Trump s temperament and not only how he treated Hillary Clinton during the debate, but women in general throughout his lifetime.One woman who was interviewed for the poll even admitted that she voted for Trump in the primary, but now is leaning towards Hillary Clinton.71-year-old Joan Hume of Fairfield, Ohio said: I m undecided, but I m leaning more towards Hillary than I ever have before because of the debate. Apparently, she wanted to see Washington shaken up, but she admitted: There s a side of him that s scary to me that I m seeing more of. I thought maybe he would change when he got the nomination, but he s getting worse. And while there are some women who apparently still think Trump is an acceptable choice despite his blatant misogyny and insults towards women, it s really not looking too great for the reality TV host considering if you want to win the White House, you need to win over women. And right now, it looks like Trump is losing while Hillary is gaining.The poll states this of independent women voters: Trump fared particularly poorly with independent women when they were asked if he has the  temperament and personality to serve.  Eighty percent of independent female voters said he does not. By contrast, independent women voters were more evenly split on Clinton s personality and temperament, with 51 percent saying she met the test for president. Yikes. That doesn t look so good for Mr. Trump.Here s the thing: Trump has a very, very long history of being absolutely horrible towards women, and the women who hadn t caught on yet are now finally starting to see the bigger picture. Chances are, more will jump ship to Clinton s side before November.

16830,WATCH HILLARY SQUIRM When Mainstream Media Asks If She Plans To Watch “13 Hours” Movie,"Hillary was too busy to be bothered with making Benghazi a safer place for Ambassador Stevens, so it should really come as no surprise that she s too busy to watch  13 HOURS,  the true story of Benghazi. By the way, whoever told Hillary that calling the families of the four men killed in Benghazi  liars,  just as the true story of what really happened under her watch is coming out in theaters nationwide, should be fired One of the enduring mysteries of the Benghazi tragedy is why anyone ever took seriously Hillary Clinton s blaming some obscure maker of a YouTube video for the attack. That mystery, however, is dwarfed by the way the media try to pretend that Hillary s denials of that happening are anything other than bald-faced (that bald-face would be pasty white, wrinkled, and bewhiskered). In testimony elicited by the Benghazi Committee and in released emails, it has become apparent that no one ever thought the video was to blame and Clinton has, herself, attempted to claim that she never blamed the video.Now there is a new  wrinkle  to the story. Hillary told the families that the video was the cause of the attack that led to the deaths of their family members. Now she is saying they are lying.First, there is her statement when she, shamelessly, stood in the hangar at Dover AFB as the bodies of the dead men returned home:CLINTON: Many others from across the Middle East and North Africa have offered similar sentiments.This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We ve seen the heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We ve seen rage and violence directed at American embassies over an awful Internet video that we had nothing to do with.Then we have the families themselves:Transcript via TownhallTyrone Woods  father (who took notes about their meeting):  I gave Hillary a hug and shook her hand. And she said we are going to have the film maker arrested who was responsible for the death of my son She said   the filmmaker who was responsible for the death of your son Sean Smith s mother:  She s absolutely lying. She told me something entirely different at the casket ceremony. She said it was because of the video. Sean Smith s uncle:  Mrs. Clinton really has a problem embracing the truth. Glen Doherty s sister:  When I think back now to that day and what she knew, it shows me a lot about her character that she would choose in that moment to basically perpetuate what she knew was untrue. On ABC s This Week, Clinton family retainer, George Stephanopoulos, revisited the issue   I have no idea why other than some misbegotten effort to  set the record straight    and got this response:https://youtu.be/jAUDS-aLGjISTEPHANOPOULOS: Did you tell them it was about the film? And what s your response?CLINTON: No. You know, look I understand the continuing grief at the loss that parents experienced with the loss of these four brave Americans. And I did testify, as you know, for 11 hours. And I answered all of these questions. Now, I can t   I can t help it the people think there has to be something else there. I said very clearly there had been a terrorist group, uh, that had taken responsibility on Facebook, um, between the time that, uh, I   you know, when I talked to my daughter, that was the latest information; we were, uh, giving it credibility. And then we learned the next day it wasn t true. In fact, they retracted it. This was a fast-moving series of events in the fog of war and I think most Americans understand that.So we have Hillary blaming the video at the arrival of the caskets. We have all four families agreeing that they were told it was a video. We have Hillary on record blaming the video in the week after the attack. And now she says it never happened.This woman is a pathological liar. The sad thing is that she could probably pass a lie detector test. Via: Red State ",Government News,"Jan 17, 2016"
5979, Leave It To Seth Meyers To Absolutely PUMMEL Trump’s Obvious Racism And Fraud (VIDEO),"It s gotten to the point that if you re still considering voting for Donald Trump in November, you ve got to be completely fine with voting for a scam artist and a misogynistic racist. Now, if those are things that you can overlook because of the simplistic view of party line politics, well, that s just sad, but it s your vote.Pointing out Trump s blatant racism, and ever-obvious scam artist antics is Seth Meyers on Late Night during a segment he calls  A Closer Look.  Meyers informed his audience of what Trump University is   fraud.He said: Trump University was founded in 2005, promising to teach people how to make money off real estate. But, as the Washington Post reported, it wasn t a university or even a school; it was just  a series of seminars held in hotel ballrooms across the country.' Meyers then compared getting a degree in business at Trump University is about as valid as getting a medical degree at the Holiday Inn Express. He also pointed out that Trump University is so bad, and so fraudulent, that it scammed mothers trying to feed their kids and even Bernie Madoff would say,  Wow, dog, that s not cool. Not only did Meyers go elbow deep into describing how much of a scam artist Trump is, but also how racist he is. He perfectly summarized it with this one statement: Now to be clear, claiming that someone is not able to do their job because of their race is, by definition, racism. Period. And in regards to Trump pointing and calling out his  African-American  and Republicans all of a sudden seeming to realize Trump is racist, Meyers said: Republicans can t pretend to suddenly be shocked and offended, this is who Trump was well before this latest outburst, and this is who [the GOP is] lining up to support  So remember this when Trump inevitably tries to convince you he s not a racist.

11385,ETHIOPIAN MUSLIM Monster Deported From U.S. 10 Years After Performing “Clitorectomy” On Daughter With Scissors,"With a growing number of Muslim refugees and immigrants living in America who are strict adherents of Sharia Law, it should come as no surprise that female genital mutilation is not so uncommon anymore in many parts of the United States. It is a felony to perform a clitorectomy on a female in America, but getting caught is the hard part A petition from the womens  group Equality Now reveals that immigration has put the United States on a list that will be much more difficult for progressive immigration enthusiasts to cheer. A massive influx of immigrants from Muslim-populated countries in Africa and the Middle East has led the group to conclude that more than half a million girls in the U.S. are in danger of having their exposed sexual organs skinned from their bodies.The practice is known as female genital mutilation (FGM).The Atlantic describes how the procedure is carried out:It usually involves the complete removal of the clitoris, and often the removal of some of the inner and outer labia. In its most extreme form infibulation almost all the external genitalia are cut away, the remaining flesh from the outer labia is sewn together, or infibulated, and the girl s legs are bound from ankle to waist for several weeks while scar tissue closes up the vagina almost completely. A small hole, typically about the diameter of a pencil, is left for urination and menstruation. The cutting is usually done with a razor, a kitchen knife, or a pair of scissors. It is rare for any anesthesia to be used.As the United States continues to mail out immigrant visas to countries with hostile and violent attitudes towards women, it will increasingly challenge Americans  self-perception of what it means to live in a First World country.Haha Dukureh, an FGM-survivor and founder of the activist organization Safe Hands for Girls, warned that  every year thousands of girls here in the United States go through female genital mutilation.   Breitbart NewsA Gwinnett County Muslim man was deported today after female  serving 10 years in an American prison (on the American taxpayer dime) for a genital mutilation sentence. An Ethiopian man convicted of aggravated battery and cruelty to children was removed from the United States on Monday.Khalid Adem, 41, was arrested for using scissors to mutilate the genitals of his 2-year-old daughter.He was deported on Monday after serving 10 years in prison.Adem was an Ethiopian citizen and native when he was living in Gwinnett County, Georgia in 2006. (He was convicted in 2006, but his wife who turned him in believes the crime was committed in 2001). His case was drew national attention for being the first criminal conviction in the United States for female genital mutilation (FGM).He became the catalyst for the specific criminalization of FGM under Georgia state law.Female genital mutilation is a federal crime, and any involvement in committing this crime is a human rights violation that results in imprisonment and potential deportation. (This crime includes doing the procedure within the United States as well as sending women overseas to be cut) .  Jihad Watch",politics,"Mar 16, 2017"

8304, ‘Millennials Rising’ Republican Super PAC Almost Entirely Funded By One 72-Year-Old White Guy,"If there is one thing that s immediately clear by attending a Republican presidential rally or looking at the demographics of Fox News it s that the modern Republican Party is not so  modern  after all. They are old. And each year, they lose more of their supporters to Father Time, while being replaced by a far more progressive youth.Understanding the basic math of this problem can sends shivers down the spine of a Republican political operative. How can they expect to compete with the Democratic Party with their supporters entering their 70s? Sadly, the most obvious answer   update your archaic policy positions, stupid!   never occurs to them. Instead, they are going to try to  fake it.  They ll pretend to be cool.One shot at this sad new attempt to cling onto relevancy comes in the form of  Millennials Rising,  a conservative Super PAC that aims to show the youth that the Republican Party can be  hip  and  dope  and  on fleek.  Their ads are pathetic as they sound.Here s one supporting Jeb Bush:Seems like it was made by an old guy desperately trying to figure out what is cool, right? That s because it kind of was.In an investigation by The Intercept, reporters found that  Millinnials Rising  is 95 percent funded by old rich guys. The principle backer is a 72-year-old billionaire who  earned  his fortune by being the grandson of an oil baron.Of the $54,960 total raised by the Super PAC, $50,000, or 91 percent, comes from the snowy-haired, 72-year-old billionaire Robert A. Day. He is the grandson of Superior Oil founder William Myron Keck and a former investment manager. Day has also given $1 million to the pro-Bush Super PAC Right to Rise.The rest of the Super PAC s backers are all about equally far into their golden years.Zooming out, the silliness of a bunch of rich old guys funding a Super PAC intended for 18-year-olds is exactly why the Republican Party is such a mess. Rather than come to accept that things like homophobia and regressive social safety net positions are out of sync with where America   especially its young people   are at, they try to throw money at the problem. Unfortunately, all the Instagram filters and Vine loops in the world can t convince young people that Republicans aren t the party of backwards policies.To give us a sense of what is coming, Mitt Romney desperately tried to win the  Millennial  vote in 2012 by throwing a fortune into ads at them   he still lost them 2 to 1.Obama easily won the youth vote nationally, 67 percent to 30 percent, with young voters proving the decisive difference in Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio, according to an analysis by the Center for Research and Information on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University.It wasn t even close.Feature image via YouTube",News,"February 6, 2016"
7369, Reporter: How Creepy Donald Trump ‘Hit On’ Me Today (TWEET),"Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump allegedly hit on a journalist on Monday. According to Karen Attiah, deputy digital editor for the Washington Post, Trump told her she was  beautiful  as she asked him a detailed question about his policies on racial inclusion. The incident happened as Trump met with the editorial board of the Washington Post on Monday.So. I got hit on today by Donald Trump.  Karen Attiah (@KarenAttiah) March 21, 2016As the meeting ended and we were walking out of the room, I thanked Trump for taking my question. He turned to me and said,  I really hope I answered your question,  and added casually with a smile,  Beautiful.  I was stunned. I didn t say thank you, and I don t think I smiled. He then walked out to meet with my Post colleagues briefly before heading to the elevator.I stayed in the conference room for a few minutes as it sunk in that the potential GOP nominee for president thought it was okay to comment on my appearance. Did he just say that?The moment made Attiah think about how Trump views the world, noting that, In Trump s world, commenting on a woman s appearance in a professional setting is fair game. She added:At least now I know, firsthand, that the sexism that Trump puts on display against Megyn Kelly under the lights of national TV is not that much different from how he is in real life toward female journalists.Trump has a history of bizarre behavior and language directed towards women.Appearing on the Howard Stern radio show, Trump discussed Latina actress Eva Longoria, telling Stern: She s really cute, I have to tell you, she s really bouncy, really cute. She s about five foot one. Do you like girls that are five foot one? They come up to you know where. He added: You have to get started, you have to like short girls. She s very, very short. You know, she goes out with a basketball player, which is interesting but she s very short. In other clips from his appearances on Stern, Trump could be heard ranking, rating and degrading various women. For instance:In one instance, Trump ranked his top 10 most beautiful women, and while his then-girlfriend Melania Knauss took the top spot, Trump told Stern he definitely would have sex with Mariah Carey, Cindy Crawford, and Princess Diana, who also made the list. In another appearance, Trump assigned each of the actors on ABC s Desperate Housewives a score of 1 to 10 based on their attractiveness. He said of one of the actors, Nicollette Sheridan:  A person who is very flat-chested is very hard to be a 10.  When he got to Marcia Cross, he asked Stern,  Would you go out with Marcia Cross or would you turn gay, Howard? Trump has a problem with women, particularly assertive women in a position of authority. This incident just appears to be more evidence of that.Featured image via Twitter/Flickr",News,"March 21, 2016"

21347,"WRONG COLOR: If Left Really Cared About Police Brutality, They’d Be Protesting Death Of White 6 Yr Old Autistic Boy Whose Dad Was Unarmed With “Hands Up” [VIDEO]","As it turns out, police brutality really isn t the issue at all. It s about dividing a nation down racial lines and the good police men and women are just part of a scheme by the Left that is being orchestrated in the highest office of our nation Police investigating the fatal shooting of a six-year-old autistic boy by two Louisiana state marshals are looking into whether one of the cops had a grudge with the child s father.Jeremy Mardis was shot five times in the head and chest as he sat in the passenger seat of his father Chris Few s car last week by officers Derrick Stafford, 32, and Norris Greenhouse.Investigators are exploring the possibility that Greenhouse, 23, had a personal issue with Few, after Few s fianc e Megan Dixon said the marshal had been messaging her on Facebook and coming round to their home.Ms Dixon has previously said she  was the reason this all started , adding that she knew what happened in the moments leading up to the shooting.Few and Ms Dixon were drinking Budweisers and shots of tequila in T.J. s Lounge and pool bar that evening before getting into an argument, the Denver Post reported.She announced to the bar that they were not seeing each other any more and started dancing with one of the barmen.Few reportedly stormed out of the bar, kicking a door as he left, before getting into a blazing row with Ms Dixon in the parking lot.They drove off in different vehicles and someone called 911.A short while later, after Few had picked up Jeremy, he pulled up next to Ms Dixon at a red light and asked her to come home with him. She said she declined because she was  stubborn .As she pulled away, Ms Dixon said she saw two marshals  cars approaching from behind with their lights flashing.She said she saw Few was pointing at his son s head, showing that he was in the car and he wasn t sure what to do.According to investigators, Few drove down a cul-de-sac as marshals Greenhouse and Stafford came round the corner.Police say Few started reversing and at this point the men opened fire, pumping 18 bullets into the SUV, five of which hit Jeremy in the head and chest.Police are investigating whether Greenhouse (left) had a grudge with Few, who was said to have confronted the cop over Facebook messages and visit to his fiancee. Pictured right, StaffordFew s attorney says footage from a bodycam worn by one of the cops shows the father putting his hands up before the officers started firing.Col.

They are being held on $1million bonds.As you can see here, these two cops were about as bad as two cops can be.

7356, Fox News Despicably Blames THIS For The Belgium Attacks Instead Of The Terrorists (VIDEO),"Rather than placing the blame for the terrorist attacks in Brussels with the terrorists where it belongs, Fox News focused on blaming something totally unrelated instead.On multiple occasions during their coverage of the bombings that took the lives of over 30 people in Brussels on Tuesday morning, Fox News hosts and contributors all made sure to blame political correctness for the attacks, even though acting like a decent human being had nothing to do with the evil acts committed by a group of extremists.In a video compilation put together by Mediaite, several Fox hosts and contributors are shown citing political correctness as the cause of the attacks and urging Americans to disregard any consideration of the feelings of people who are discriminated against. As long as political correctness and fear of being called a bigot dominate we can t have the conversation,  said one Fox contributor at the beginning of the video. Another alluded to Donald Trump and how he is leading the Republican primary because he isn t politically correct, because that s somehow something to be proud of.Yet another Fox talking head called for dropping political correctness because that the only way to  protect the homeland.  There was even a suggestion that the only way to fix the threat of terrorism in our world is end political correctness. One Fox nut even claimed that political correctness is  literally killing us in this country.  Laura Ingraham even repeated that being PC can kill. Fox also complained about how they are hit with charges of Islamophobia whenever they cover ISIS and terrorist attacks.Here s the video via YouTube.But the problem is not that Fox is covering ISIS and terrorist attacks, it s that they usually always attack ALL Muslims as if the entire Muslim population is guilty of the attacks committed by a few religious extremists who do not represent the Muslim world, just like the KKK doesn t represent all Christians here in America.Being politically correct does not cause terrorist attacks. Hate and intolerance does and you won t hear Fox News talk about that at all. They d rather waste their time whining about how they can t be hateful and intolerant of Muslims without being called out for being the racists they are.It s important that we treat innocent Muslims with respect and dignity during this tragic time. Discriminating against them also makes things worse and gives ISIS new potential recruits to target.For a  news  outlet that constantly claims to be aligned with Christianity, Fox News sure does like war, hate, and bigotry when what we need right now is love and unity.Also, how much more despicable can Fox News get using yet another terrible deadly act of violence to push their own political agenda instead of simply reporting the news and showing sympathy to the dead?Featured image via screen capture",News,"March 22, 2016"
15589,WHY ARE GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK ATTENDING BILDERBERG’S 2015 LUXURY SECRET POLICY CONFERENCE?,"Why are banking powerhouses, European Prime Ministers, a major arms manufacturer, a representative from the US State Department, Facebook and Google all attending the same secret policy summit? One of Bilderberg s founders and steering committee member, Denis Healey said in 2001:  To say we were striving for a one-world government is exaggerated, but not wholly unfair. Those of us in Bilderberg felt we couldn t go on forever fighting one another for nothing and killing people and rendering millions homeless. So we felt that a single community throughout the world would be a good thing. From The Guardian: As one summit closes, another opens. Thursday sees the start of the influential Bilderberg policy conference, which this year is being held in Austria, just 16 miles south of the G7 summit, and in a similarly inaccessible luxury alpine resort. The participant list for the conference has just been released by the organisation, and some big names leap off the page.No fewer than three serving European prime ministers will be attending, from the Netherlands, Finland and Belgium. They will be discussing  European strategy  with the head of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, and the president of Austria, Heinz Fischer. Two European finance ministers are on the list: one Dutch, the other George Osborne. The UK chancellor is a regular attendee of the Bilderberg summit, and this year he will be showing off his post-election glow. Unlike that other Bilderberg regular, Ed Balls, who is being invited back despite having by some considerable distance the weakest job title on the list:  former shadow chancellor of the exchequer.Europe s hottest financial potato, Greece, is on the conference agenda, and it s good to know Beno t Coeur , a member of the executive board of the European Central Bank, will be there to discuss it in strictest privacy with interested parties, such as the heads of Deutsche Bank, Lazard, Banco Santander and HSBC.The scandal-hit HSBC and everyone s favourite vampire squid, Goldman Sachs, are both extremely well represented at this year s conference. HSBC in particular by its chairman, its busy chief legal officer, and board member Rona Fairhead, who is also on the board of PepsiCo and chair of the BBC Trust. Good to know the BBC is in such safe hands.Other financial luminaries on the list include the vice-chairman of BlackRock, the CEO of JP Morgan Asset Management and the president of the Royal Bank of Canada, which is the nation s largest financial institution. Morgan Stanley will be represented in Telfs by board member Klaus Kleinfeld, who also runs the world s third largest aluminium producer, Alcoa.From the worlds of industry and manufacturing are some eye-wateringly big names. The CEO of Michelin is invited, along with the head of Roche, the CEO of Royal Dutch Shell, the chairman of BP, the CEO of Siemens Austria and the heads of various industrial conglomerates such as Techint and Investor AB, companies so large they re hard to classify. Although  gigantic  goes some way towards it.It s a heady step up into the big league for Michael O Leary, the CEO of Ryanair. He ll doubtless be hoping to thrash out a few last-minute deals over dinner with the head of Airbus, Thomas Enders.Apart from making holiday jets, Airbus is also one of the world s biggest arms manufacturers, and the 2015 conference agenda has a distinct whiff of war. Chemical weapons threats and Nato are both set to be discussed. Luckily the head of Nato is there to discuss it.As ever, foreign policy formation is a big part of the conference. Terrorism and Iran both make the agenda this year, and participants can expect a high-level briefing from senior US State Department official John R Allen, the special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter Isil. And it s likely that the subject of Russia will be of interest to the German defence minister and deputy defence minister, both of whom have found the time this week to be in Telfs. As has the head of the Danish intelligence service, who will likely have a part to play in the session of cybersecurity.Finally, it s worth noting the growing presence of Google at Bilderberg. The company s executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, is on the group s steering committee; he ll be joined in Austria by his vice-president for engineering, advanced technology and projects, and the vice-president of engineering for the not-at-all terrifying sounding Google DeepMind. They, presumably, will be leading the session on artificial intelligence. This will be listened to with great interest by Peter Thiel, the founder of PayPal and director of Facebook, as he continues his quest to merge with computers. But that s another story.For now, the story is: Bilderberg 2015 has an extremely high-powered participant list, featuring a large number of senior politicians and public figures. With participants this powerful, and an agenda containing this many hot topics, the Telfs policy conference is sure to be covered in depth by the world s press. And by  sure to be , I mean probably won t be. For reasons that, as ever, escape me.Via: The Guardian ",politics,"Jun 9, 2015"
7661, Fox News Humiliates Mitt Romney For Flip-Flopping On Donald Trump (VIDEO),"Mitt Romney looked like a defeated man too embarrassed to admit that the rise of Donald Trump is partly his fault.During an appearance on Fox News Sunday, the former Republican presidential nominee  was forced to confront the reality that accepting Donald Trump s endorsement in 2012 legitimized the current Republican front-runner among conservative voters.Fox host Chris Wallace mentioned that Romney  had a very different view of him four years ago when he endorsed you,  and proceeded to remind Romney of that endorsement by playing video of him accepting it and touting Trump as a successful businessman in the process.Romney responded by saying that just because someone endorsed him doesn t mean he thinks they can be president.  Sixty-one million people voted for me,,  Romney said.  I don t think all 61 million ought to be president of the United States. But Wallace hit Romney like a ton of bricks by pointing out that Romney is flip-flopping, a charge that hurt Romney repeatedly during the 2012 Election.As Romney sat and listened in defeated silence, Wallace told him that most of the business failures Romney listed during his anti-Trump speech actually occurred prior to 2012 when Romney praised Trump s business experience and knowledge of how the economy works. But you were talking at the time about his extraordinary ability to create jobs, his understanding of the economy. It s not like   Donald Trump   everything you believe he did wrong has happened in the last four years. A lot of those business failures you talk about happened before 2012. Before 2012, he was making the birther argument that President Obama needed to show his birth certificate because he wasn t born in the United States. I guess part of the question is, by legitimizing him back then, were you part of the reason he is where he is now?

5388, Texas Schools Proposed Textbooks : Mexicans Are Lazy And Want To Destroy Society,"Texas textbooks are once again in the limelight. After years of asking for ethnic studies, they finally offered them. The only problem is that the books are teaching young minds the Donald Trump message   that Mexicans are lazy and want to destroy the country.School textbooks in Texas have long been a source of controversy because Texas textbook writers play more than a little loose with facts. The books whitewash slavery and the Civil War, they completely ignore the existence of the KKK and of the Jim Crow era. They mention segregation, but only as a footnote and only as something that s not that bad.Texas science books teach creationism, that the earth is 6,000 years old and that there s no such thing as climate change. Now, they are teaching pure racism and xenophobia and kids across the nation could be learning those lessons.Not surprisingly, Republicans outnumber Democrats in the Texas Board of Education by two to one. Democrats have been trying for two years to create a Mexican-American studies program, which makes perfect sense since the majority of Texas public school children are Latino.Republicans on the board balked at the idea, but they finally caved, sort of. There are now Mexican-American studies, but they are as racist as a Donald Trump rally or as the GOP convention happening in Cleveland.(Attorney with the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Celina) Moreno and other activists are part of the new Responsible Ethnic Studies Text Coalition, which scrutinized the proposed textbooks and detailed what it described as  multiple factual errors.  The coalition said those included suggesting that Mexican culture promotes laziness, linking Mexican-Americans to immigrants who are not in the country legally, and characterizing leaders of the Chicano movement that advanced Mexican-American civil rights in the 1960s and  70s as adopting  a revolutionary narrative that opposed Western civilization and wanted to destroy this society. Industrialists were very driven, competitive men,  the textbook says, according to excerpts.  In contrast, Mexican laborers were not reared to put in a full day s work so vigorously. There was a cultural attitude of  manana,  or  tomorrow.' Source: My San AntonioRepublicans evan admit that they did it just to piss Democrats off.You ought to be careful what you ask for. You got it,  (Board member, David) Bradley, a Republican from Beaumont, said in a phone interview.He said Texas should focus on basics like reading, writing and math before worrying about more specialized courses. I m Italian, Irish and French,  Bradley said.  And I feel like I m being discriminated against when we only have an exclusive minority studies program in Texas. the books aren t out yet. They are up for a vote in November, but the really frightening thing is that if they are published, students around the nation could be reading that Mexicans are lazy.Featured image via Pixabay.

6062, NY Attorney General On Trump University: ‘This Is Straight Up Fraud’ (VIDEO),"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is trying really hard to ignore the controversy and lawsuit surrounding Trump University. Earlier this week he even attacked the media because they had the audacity to do their jobs and report on the lengths the university went to in their efforts to defraud people of their money. On Thursday, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman appeared on MSNBC s Morning Joe to discuss Trump U and said the university was not legitimate and the GOP nominee knew it. This is straight up fraud. It s like selling people something you say is a Mercedes and it turns out to be a Volkswagen,  Schneiderman said.  And even if some people say,  Well actually, I kind of like the Volkswagen,  it s still fraud because it s not a Mercedes. This was not a university. Although Trump claims that he will be vindicated and Trump U was completely above-board, the details of the three lawsuits against him tell a different story. During an interview with Fox News in February, the billionaire claimed that he  handpicked the staff for the school and those people did a  good job.  AG Schneiderman told the hosts at Morning Joe that those statements were blatant lies: Trump s role was really as the pitchman. And we ve got his videotapes, and we ve got his sworn testimony which undercuts every statement in the videotapes. He said,  My hand-picked experts will teach you my personal secrets.  He and the president of the university have already testified under oath he never met the instructors, they weren t hand-picked. They weren t experts   some of them came out of fast food and retail. And he had nothing to do with the supposed secrets that were taught because he had nothing to do with the curriculum.The attorney general added that Trump scammed these people during one of the worst economic times in American history: So people were led to believe they were getting the personal secrets of Trump, during hard economic times, we re talking about 2008, 2009, 2010. People wanted to scramble to find a way to make money, he duped them in, thousands of people paid millions of dollars and we re out to get them their money back. Think about what all of this means for a minute. Before the housing market collapse, Trump said that he wanted the bubble to burst so that he could make money. That eventually happened and millions of Americans suffered greatly. People lost their homes, their jobs, their savings, it was horrific. So, after he prayed for their demise by wishing the crash would happen, he convinced people to go to Trump University so that they could get out of the holes they were in and become rich like him   but it was all a scam. Now this same person is running for president and he is one step away from the most powerful position in the world. How did he get there? By, once again, scamming people into believing that he will save them.Donald Trump is a horrible human being and we must come together and keep him out of the Oval Office. So, remember, vote blue   no matter who.Watch:NY @AGSchneiderman on Trump U: This is just straight up fraud https://t.co/OUjj1BEt81  Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) June 2, 2016Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"June 2, 2016"
4475, Here You Go: Every Bat Sh*t Crazy Thing That Came Out Of Trump’s Mouth In The First Debate,"Donald Trump spent Monday night making a total ass out of himself in the first presidential debate. We were all waiting to see just what would happen tonight, and it was quite the spectacle. From lies to self-incrimination, watching the GOP nominee s performance was the equivalent of one facepalm after another.So here you go, a complete list of every batshit crazy thing that came out of Donald Trump s mouth during the first presidential debate: There s nobody in our government to fight them [China], and we have a very good fight, and we have a winning fight. They re using our country as a piggy bank to rebuild China and many other countries are doing the same thing. We have to stop these countries from stealing our companies. Our country s in deep trouble.  We don t know what we re doing with devaluations  Especially when it comes to China, they re the best.  They re the best ever at it. What they re doing to us is a very very sad thing. That s called business, by the way.  (referring to making money off of the 2007 financial collapse) I m a great believer in all forms of energy  Our country is losing a so much in terms of energy, in terms of paying off our debt. I will bring back jobs.  You can t bring back jobs. That s about all you ve got.  (referring to Clinton s book We Are Stronger Together) You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history.  You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history.  You are going to drive businesses out. I m going to cut taxes, big-league.  You are going to raise taxes, big-league. And take a look at mine also.  (referring to his campaign website) She tells us how to fight ISIS on her website.  I don t think Douglas MacArthur would like that too much  You re telling the enemy everything you want to do.  No wonder you ve been fighting ISIS your entire adult life. Well, I m really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going to create tremendous jobs.  They re going to expand their companies.  They re going to do a tremendous job.  (hahahaha) I m getting rid of the carried interest provision, and if you really look, it s really not a great thing for the wealthy, it s really a great thing for middle class.  (methinks thou dost protest too much) These people are going to put billions and billions of dollars into companies.  And when they re going to bring 2.5 trillion dollars back from overseas, where they can t bring the money back because politicians like Secretary Clinton won t allow them to bring the money back because the taxes are so onerous and the bureaucratic red tape is so bad.  (or because those companies are greedy and un-American, just saying) So, what they re doing is leaving our country, and believe it or not, they re leaving our country because the taxes are too high.  Because some of them companies have lots of money outside our country, and instead of bringing it back and putting the money to work because they can t work out a deal.  And everybody agrees it should be brought back, instead of that they re leaving our country to get their money because they can t bring their money back into our country, because of bureacratic red tape.  Because they can t get together, because we have a President that can t sit them around a table, and get them to approve something.   (maybe companies should just pay their taxes so we don t need to cut valuable public services) We have no leadership, and honestly, that starts with Secretary Clinton  Why not [blame Clinton for everything]? We re in a bubble right now, and the only thing that looks good is the stock market. We have a FED that is doing political things  the FED is being more political than Secretary Clinton When we have a country that s doing so badly, that s being ripped off by every single country in the world, it s the kind of thinking that our country needs. We have people that are political hacks negotiating our trade deals.  (in response to a question about his taxes) I ve been under audit for almost 15 years.  I know a lot of wealthy people that have never been audited.  I say,  Have you been audited?   I get audited almost every year, and in a way I should be complaining.  I m not even complaining.  I don t mind it.  It s almost become a way of life.  I get audited by the IRS, but other people don t. We have a situation in this country that needs to be taken care of.  I will release my tax returns against my lawyers wishes That makes me smart.  (in response to paying zero dollars in federal income taxes) I could give you a list of banks, if that would help you.  I would give you a list of banks.  These are very fine institutions, very fine banks.  I could do that very quickly. I have a tremendous income.  The reason I say that is not in a braggadocios way. It s about time that this country had somebody running it that has an idea about money. Our airports are like from a third world country  We ve become a third world country.  The worst of all things has happened. And it s really a shame. And it s politicians like Secretary Clinton that have caused this problem. Our country has tremendous problems. We re a debtor nation. We re a serious debtor nation. And we have a country that needs new roads, new tunnels, new bridges, new airports, new schools, new hospitals. And we don t have the money, because it s been squandered on so many of your ideas. It would be squandered, too, believe me.  (in response to not paying any federal income taxes) Maybe he didn t do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work  Which our country should do, too.  (referring to not paying people who worked for him) But on occasion, four times, we used certain laws that are there. And when Secretary Clinton talks about people that didn t get paid, first of all, they did get paid a lot, but taken advantage of the laws of the nation.  Now, if you want to change the laws, you ve been there a long time, change the laws. But I take advantage of the laws of the nation because I m running a company. My obligation right now is to do well for myself, my family, my employees, for my companies. And that s what I do.  (referring to bankrupting four companies and not paying his business debts) But what she doesn t say is that tens of thousands of people that are unbelievably happy and that love me. I ll give you an example. We re just opening up on Pennsylvania Avenue right next to the White House, so if I don t get there one way, I m going to get to Pennsylvania Avenue another. When we look at the budget, the budget is bad to a large extent because we have people that have no idea as to what to do and how to buy. Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn t want to use a couple of words, and that s law and order. And we need law and order. If we don t have it, we re not going to have a country. Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. We have to be   we have to know what we re doing. Right now, our police, in many cases, are afraid to do anything. No, you re wrong. It went before a judge, who was a very against-police judge. It was taken away from her. And our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal. If you look at it, throughout the country, there are many places where it s allowed.  (referring to racial profiling becoming outlawed as unconstitutional) We need law and order. And we need law and order in the inner cities, because the people that are most affected by what s happening are African-American and Hispanic people. And it s very unfair to them what our politicians are allowing to happen. I have the endorsement of the NRA, which I m very proud of. These are very, very good people. But I think we have to look very strongly at no-fly lists and watch lists. And when people are on there, even if they shouldn t be on there, we ll help them, we ll help them legally, we ll help them get off. But I tend to agree with that quite strongly. But stop-and- frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact. They ve been abused and used in order to get votes by Democrat politicians, because that s what it is. They ve controlled these communities for up to 100 years. You know, you ve seen me, I ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home, and that s OK. But I will tell you, I ve been all over. And I ve met some of the greatest people I ll ever meet within these communities. When I got involved, I didn t fail. I got him to give the birth certificate. So I m satisfied with it. And I ll tell you why I m satisfied with it But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate. And I think I did a good job Well, it was very   I say nothing. I say nothing, because I was able to get him to produce it. He should have produced it a long time before. I say nothing. But let me just tell you. When you talk about healing, I think that I ve developed very, very good relationships over the last little while with the African-American community. I think you can see that.  And I feel that they really wanted me to come to that conclusion And I think I did a great job and a great service not only for the country, but even for the president, in getting him to produce his birth certificate. First of all, I got to watch in preparing for this some of your debates against Barack Obama. You treated him with terrible disrespect.  And I watched the way you talk now about how lovely everything is and how wonderful you are. It doesn t work that way. You were after him. Now, as far as the lawsuit, yes, when I was very young, I went into my father s company, had a real estate company in Brooklyn and Queens, and we, along with many, many other companies throughout the country   it was a federal lawsuit   were sued. We settled the suit with zero   with no admission of guilt. It was very easy to do. And, you know, I also notice the very nasty commercials that you do on me in so many different ways, which I don t do on you. Maybe I m trying to save the money. But, frankly, I look   I look at that, and I say, isn t that amazing? Because I settled that lawsuit with no admission of guilt, but that was a lawsuit brought against many real estate firms, and it s just one of those things. I ll go one step further. In Palm Beach, Florida, tough community, a brilliant community, a wealthy community, probably the wealthiest community there is in the world, I opened a club, and really got great credit for it. No discrimination against African- Americans, against Muslims, against anybody. And it s a tremendously successful club. And I m so glad I did it. And I have been given great credit for what I did. And I m very, very proud of it. And that s the way I feel. That is the true way I feel. In addition, I was just endorsed by ICE. They ve never endorsed anybody before on immigration. I was just endorsed by ICE. As far as the cyber, I agree to parts of what Secretary Clinton said. We should be better than anybody else, and perhaps we re not. I don t think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. She s saying Russia, Russia, Russia, but I don t   maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK? Now, whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country, we don t know, because the truth is, under President Obama we ve lost control of things that we used to have control over. We came in with the Internet, we came up with the Internet, and I think Secretary Clinton and myself would agree very much, when you look at what ISIS is doing with the Internet, they re beating us at our own game. ISIS. So we have to get very, very tough on cyber and cyber warfare. It is   it is a huge problem. I have a son. He s 10 years old. He has computers. He is so good with these computers, it s unbelievable. The security aspect of cyber is very, very tough. And maybe it s hardly doable. But I will say, we are not doing the job we should be doing. But that s true throughout our whole governmental society. We have so many things that we have to do better and certainly cyber is one of them. So she talks about taking them out. She s been doing it a long time. She s been trying to take them out for a long time. But they wouldn t have even been formed if they left some troops behind, like 10,000 or maybe something more than that. And then you wouldn t have had them.  (speaking about the creation of ISIS) Or, as I ve been saying for a long time, and I think you ll agree, because I said it to you once, had we taken the oil   and we should have taken the oil   ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income. And now they have the oil all over the place, including the oil   a lot of the oil in Libya. Wrong  Wrong.  Wrong. The secretary said very strongly about working with   we ve been working with them for many years, and we have the greatest mess anyone s ever seen. But you look at the Middle East, you started the Iran deal, that s another beauty where you have a country that was ready to fall, I mean, they were doing so badly. They were choking on the sanctions. And now they re going to be actually probably a major power at some point pretty soon, the way they re going. Number one, the 28 countries of NATO, many of them aren t paying their fair share. Number two   and that bothers me, because we should be asking   we re defending them, and they should at least be paying us what they re supposed to be paying by treaty and contract. And, number two, I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because   and I was very strong on this, and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times, which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest   but I said, they do not focus on terror. And I was very strong. And I said it numerous times. And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division. And I think that s great. And I think we should get   because we pay approximately 73 percent of the cost of NATO. It s a lot of money to protect other people. But I m all for NATO. But I said they have to focus on terror, also.  And they re going to do that. And that was   believe me   I m sure I m not going to get credit for it   but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO. And believe me, you were the ones that took out the troops. Not only that, you named the day. They couldn t believe it. They sat back probably and said, I can t believe it. But you were there, and you were secretary of state when it was a little infant. Now it s in over 30 countries. And you re going to stop them? I don t think so. That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she   frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media. Well, I have much better judgment than she does. There s no question about that. I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know? I have a much better   she spent   let me tell you   she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising   you know, they get Madison Avenue into a room, they put names   oh, temperament, let s go after   I think my strongest asset, maybe by far, is my temperament. I have a winning temperament. I know how to win. She does not have a Wait. The AFL-CIO the other day, behind the blue screen, I don t know who you were talking to, Secretary Clinton, but you were totally out of control. I said, there s a person with a temperament that s got a problem. Wrong  It s lies That line s getting a little bit old, I must say. I would like to It s not an accurate one at all. It s not an accurate one. So I just want to give a lot of things   and just to respond. I agree with her on one thing. The single greatest problem the world has is nuclear armament, nuclear weapons, not global warming, like you think and your   your president thinks.  Nuclear is the single greatest threat. Just to go down the list, we defend Japan, we defend Germany, we defend South Korea, we defend Saudi Arabia, we defend countries. They do not pay us. But they should be paying us, because we are providing tremendous service and we re losing a fortune. That s why we re losing   we re losing   we lose on everything. I say, who makes these   we lose on everything. All I said, that it s very possible that if they don t pay a fair share, because this isn t 40 years ago where we could do what we re doing. We can t defend Japan, a behemoth, selling us cars by the million. All I said was, they may have to defend themselves or they have to help us out. We re a country that owes $20 trillion. They have to help us out. Well, I have to say that, you know, for what Secretary Clinton was saying about nuclear with Russia, she s very cavalier in the way she talks about various countries. But Russia has been expanding their   they have a much newer capability than we do. We have not been updating from the new standpoint. We are not   we are not keeping up with other countries. I would like everybody to end it, just get rid of it. But I would certainly not do first strike. I think that once the nuclear alternative happens, it s over. At the same time, we have to be prepared. I can t take anything off the table. Because you look at some of these countries, you look at North Korea, we re doing nothing there. China should solve that problem for us. China should go into North Korea. China is totally powerful as it relates to North Korea. Why didn t you add other things into the deal? One of the great giveaways of all time, of all time, including $400 million in cash. Nobody s ever seen that before. That turned out to be wrong. It was actually $1.7 billion in cash, obviously, I guess for the hostages. It certainly looks that way.  So you say to yourself, why didn t they make the right deal? This is one of the worst deals ever made by any country in history. And they re going to end up getting nuclear. I met with Bibi Netanyahu the other day. Believe me, he s not a happy camper. But I will tell you that Hillary will tell you to go to her website and read all about how to defeat ISIS, which she could have defeated by never having it, you know, get going in the first place. Right now, it s getting tougher and tougher to defeat them, because they re in more and more places, more and more states, more and more nations. And she doesn t say that, because she s got no business ability. We need heart. We need a lot of things. But you have to have some basic ability. And sadly, she doesn t have that. All you have to do is speak to them. Wait. You have so many different things you have to be able to do, and I don t believe that Hillary has the stamina. The world   let me tell you. Let me tell you. Hillary has experience, but it s bad experience. We have made so many bad deals during the last   so she s got experience, that I agree.  But it s bad, bad experience. I never said that  I didn t say that  Where did you find this?  Oh, really? You know, Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some of it s said in entertainment. Some of it s said   somebody who s been very vicious to me, Rosie O Donnell, I said very tough things to her, and I think everybody would agree that she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her. But you want to know the truth?  I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself,  I can t do it. I just can t do it. It s inappropriate. It s not nice. Wow. In hindsight, it would have probably been easier to list the things Trump said that weren t completely and utterly ridiculous. When it finally came time to face off with Hillary Clinton on the debate stage, Trump failed miserably and totally embarrassed himself. As Hillary said Monday night, Donald  lives in his own reality,  presumably a reality where he thinks he actually makes sense.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"September 27, 2016"
21576,WHY OBAMA IGNORED MURDER BY ILLEGAL ALIEN IN SANCTUARY CITY: You Have Never Seen Megyn Kelly This Mad Before!,"Fox News host Megyn Kelly shut down a liberal guest in a blistering Thursday night exchange about President Barack Obama s silence on the senseless killing of Kate Steinle at a San Francisco tourist area.Kelly observed that the president was only too willing to speak out on the Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Freddie Gray killings, but was noticeably silent on Steinle, who was killed by an illegal immigrant who d been deported five times and had seven felony convictions. When asked repeatedly this week to speak to this case, White House spokesman Josh Earnest declined to weigh in, other than to refer folks to the Department of Homeland Security,  Kelly said.  A stark contrast to what we saw after Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson [Missouri], a man we now know was attacking a police officer at the time of his death. Liberal talk show host Richard Fowler made the ridiculous claim that the woman would be alive today if Congress had passed immigration reform legislation. Stop that! Stop that! Stop that! Answer my question please,  Kelly said.  Give an answer! You can t!   There s no excuse for it! He picks and chooses the victims he wants to highlight. And apparently, this victim wasn t deemed worthy. When political consultant Marc Thiessen asked Fowler to explain his statement that Obama doesn t support sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants, Fowler veered off into left field and again brought up lack of immigration reform, placing the blame on Republican lawmakers for not acting on immigration reform. That s a dodge! Support what you just said, Richard!  Kelly shot back.  Stop it   You keep making these assertions and then you dance off to the sidelines. You said the president doesn t support sanctuary city policies. What do you base that on? I base it on the fact that if we had comprehensive immigration reform there would be no need for sanctuary cities,  Fowler repeated.  And I m pretty sure the White House would tell you the same thing tonight. Via: Breitbart News",left-news,"Jul 11, 2015"
19453,NFL LEGEND Who Supported Hillary Leaves CNN Host Speechless Over Praise For Trump…People Who “called him names when he won”…”He reached back and brought them along with him. He held no grudges”[VIDEO]," I fell in love with him [Trump] because he really talks about helping African-American black people, and that s why I m here. Gotta give the man his due. Donald Trump may be the only person alive equally capable of charming Kanye West, Jim Brown, and Mitt Romney. However you may feel about his shtick on the stump, the guy must have a genius-level quotient of personal charisma in private conversation when he feels like summoning it. I wonder how it ll translate in diplomatic meetings, with leaders from other cultures. It s hard to imagine Trump and Merkel hitting it off in the same way it s hard to imagine Merkel hitting it off with, say, Don King, but nothing would surprise me anymore. Brown sounds like he s ready to sign up for the reelection campaign here.  HA When he goes through what he went through to become the President, he s got my admiration.

3525," Democrats Introduce Legislation To Probe Russian Voting Hacks, Trump PISSED","It s no secret that Donald Trump got a lot of help from the Russian government this election. From the wildfire of fake news spread across the internet to leaks on Hillary Clinton, Russia and its dear leader Vladimir Putin were in the bag for the new president-elect.But there s proof that the Kremlin and its band of thugs may have acted in a more nefarious, intricate way   and Democrats want to expose that.House Democrats, led by ranking member Adam Schiff (California) of the Committee on Intelligence, are set to introduce legislation that calls for a federal probe into whether or not   and to what extent   the Russian government played in the U.S. election via hacking,  to take action on evidence of foreign interference in the 2016 U.S. elections.  California Rep. Eric Swalwell and Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings will introduce the bill in the lame duck sessionIn a letter to the White House, Schiff asked that President Obama share with members of Congress a classified report that details Russia s potential role in swaying the outcome of the election   and that it very well could have given us President Trump:We are deeply concerned by Russian efforts to undermine, interfere with and even influence the outcome of our recent election. By eroding Americans  and foreigners  trust in US institutions, Russia both weakens our country and sows global instability and uncertainty.The letter, signed by all six Democrats on the committee, comes days after Senate Democrats sent the White House a similar letter urging transparency on Russia.In Time magazine, Donald Trump told interviewers that he does not believe Russia had instigated a hack (or any other meddling) and that the concern of such was politically motivated by the Democrats: I don t believe it. I don t believe they interfered,  Trump said in an interview with Time magazine, which named him person of the year.When asked by Time if the conclusion reached by U.S. officials was motivated by politics, Trump responded,  I think so. While it s unclear how much of an impact the intrusions had on the election outcome, the revelations proved embarrassing for the Democratic Party and cost DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz her job at the top of the committee.Instead, Trump famously blamed any hacking and counter-election offenses by a 400 pound guy in a basement somewhere in the United States (without providing evidence).While Trump peddles conspiracy theories, Democrats seek to legitimize the electoral process of the United States.Featured image via Winn McNamee/Getty Images",News,"December 7, 2016"
20901,BERNIE SUES To Allow 17 Year Olds To Vote,"Next up is a law suit to make it legal for H-1B Visa holders, felons and illegal aliens to vote in every state. You didn t think the Democrats were trying to protect illegals and grant dangerous criminals an early release because they cared about them, did you? Bernie Sanders s campaign has filed a lawsuit against Ohio s secretary of state to allow 17-year olds to vote in the Democratic primary on March 15, according to a CNN report.Sanders s campaign manager told reporters in Michigan on Tuesday that Republican Jon Husted, who is Ohio s secretary of State, has changed the rules to make it so that those who are currently 17, but will be 18 by the time of the November general election, cannot vote in the state s primaries. The secretary of state has decided to disenfranchise people who are 17 but will be 18 by the day of the general election,  Weaver said, according to CNN.  Those people have been allowed to vote under the law of Ohio, but the secretary of state of the state of Ohio has decided to disenfranchise those people to forbid them from voting in the primary that is coming up on March 15. Sanders has galvanized the support of many young liberal voters, and routinely thumps Democratic rival Hillary Clinton among voters under the age of 40. Clinton generally dominates Sanders among older voters.[quote_box_center]After eight years of Obama, who delivered the same false message of  hope  via free sh*t to America s youth, Bernie Sanders supporters are ready to cast their vote for another lying politician who is promising them a utopia that s impossible to deliver. [/quote_box_center]Millenials are struggling with an immense burden of student debt   debt that rose 25% between 2008 and 2012 alone (the Obama years) even as the economy struggled. According to one 2014 calculation, millennials make up about 40% of the ranks of the unemployed; when they have jobs, they may be underemployed (Starbucks barista, anyone?) or underpaid, or competing ruthlessly for a handful of lucrative opportunities. Some studies suggest that while they might be frugal, their financial situations (coupled, sometimes, with a dearth of financial literacy) can spell trouble.One Pricewaterhouse Coopers survey found 24% of millennial respondents were familiar with basic financial concepts; 30% routinely overdrew their checking accounts (racking up banking fees) and more than 20% ended up dipping into their retirement savings (incurring fees and penalties). Nearly half couldn t come up with $2,000 in the next month in an emergency, making them  financially fragile .The last president elected with a platform of hope and change largely failed to deliver, in their eyes. Oh, and his administration included Hillary Clinton.The issue [of allowing 17 year olds to vote] came to light after a report in the Columbus Dispatch, in which a state Democratic lawmaker accused Husted of changing the rules to keep those who will be 18 by Nov. 4 from voting in the presidential primary.Husted called those accusations and the Sanders lawsuit baseless in a statement released over Twitter, saying that Ohio is operating under the same set of rules it has used in past primaries.Husted s response to Sanders  ridiculous lawsuit can be found here:Some facts about voting for 17-year-olds   they can vote in the primary on nominations, not on delegates or issues. pic.twitter.com/i7pe7Eg6Wl  Jon Husted (@JonHusted) March 8, 2016Via: The Hill",left-news,"Mar 10, 2016"

CHICAGO REPORTEDLY FINDS At Least 14,000 More Votes Than Voters In 2016 Election","The head of the Chicago Republican Party is claiming the city reported thousands of more votes cast than voters in the 2016 election   sparking a battle with Chicago officials who call the allegations overblown.First reported by the Chicago City Wire, the Chicago GOP filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the Chicago Board of Elections in January for a list of voters who had cast ballots in November. According to the party, the board responded with a list of 1,101,178 individuals, though its website reflects 1,115,664 votes cast. There should never be more votes than voters every ballot cast should be recorded against a registered voter,  Chairman of the Chicago GOP Chris Cleveland told Fox News, explaining that after receiving the data, the party  immediately  contacted the board for  clarification.   This is either massive fraud or massive incompetence, but we have no way of telling the difference because they won t give us the data. The discrepancy totals more than 14,000, though Cleveland claims it could be as high as 16,000.Cleveland told Fox News he filed a number of FOIA requests the original in January, and  several follow ups  for updated numbers. They ignored them,  Cleveland said.  They have been stonewalling us for six months.

No crime, no guns. The couple s plans pour further scorn over Stephanopoulos s supposed  objectivity  given his role as a prominent interviewer for ABC, having interviewed Donald Trump twice over the election cycle.  BreitbartNotice how ABC starts out the interview between Stephanopoulos and Conway by flashing a screen shot of Hillary s popular vote numbers compared to Trump s when they have nothing to do with the context of the conversation. This is called subliminal messaging, proving the mainstream media has mastered the art of manipulation. Watch the interview here. Stephanopoulos and his wife s connections to Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party are well documented, with Stephanopoulos having previously worked as an adviser to Bill Clinton and the couple also having donated over $75,000 to the Clinton Foundation.Trump himself pointed out Stephanopoulos s ties to the Clinton Foundation in their most recent interview.

3958, Senator Asks DOJ To Step In After White Supremacists Vow To Engage In Poll Watching,"A senator from Pennsylvania is asking the Department of Justice to step in following widespread media reports of white supremacists who have vowed to engage in poll watching on election day to guard against voter fraud.Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) wrote a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, pleading for the DOJ to intervene. These plans to monitor the polls are little more than thinly veiled attempts to suppress and delegitimize the votes of predominantly minority citizens, inflected with innuendo that recalls dark times in our country s civil rights struggle,  Casey wrote.  These calls are more than wrong and irresponsible; if executed, they could be illegal. It has been reported that the National Socialist Movement elements of the Ku Klux Klan and the American Freedom Party are planning to send members to polls in Philadelphia, and elsewhere across the country. Their goal is to ensure that Donald Trump isn t cheated out of the presidency due to voter fraud and a  rigged  election.One alt-right website is even claiming that white supremacists will be handing out liquor and marijuana in the  ghetto  of Philadelphia to help make sure minorities don t make it to the polls to cast their ballots. It has also been reported that hidden cameras will be installed throughout the city to help monitor activities.Casey told the DOJ that appalling tactics such as these must not be permitted under any circumstances. We have come too far to allow a group of white nationalists to intimidate minority voters in Philadelphia or anywhere throughout the nation,  he wrote.Trump has worked his bigoted base into a frenzy over claims that the election is  rigged.  (It s not.) He has convinced his supporters that  voter fraud  is a viable threat, when in fact, it is virtually nonexistent. These poll watching activities aren t even remotely intended to protect our system of fair elections. The only purpose for white supremacists to come out in droves to guard the polls with guns is to intimidate minorities and prevent them from voting.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images",News,"November 3, 2016"
7653, Joe Biden Told A Joke To President Obama About Ted Cruz That Will Have You On The Floor (VIDEO),"Ted Cruz isn t the most likeable guy out there   you ve probably heard this before. And it s not just the media being the media trying to make him look bad   there s a reason Senator Cruz has virtually no endorsements from any of his fellow senators in Congress. It s because the accusations are true; not that many people like the guy, plain and simple.That being said, Vice President Joe Biden made everyone s night (at Ted Cruz s expense) at the Annual Gridiron Dinner on Saturday when he capitalized on this sentiment by telling the crowd a joke he told to President Obama behind closed doors: Ted Cruz? An inspiration to every kid in America who worries that he ll never be able to run for President because nobody likes him.I told Barack, if you really, really want to remake the Supreme Court, nominate Cruz. Before you know it, you ll have eight vacancies. That s not the only joke the vice president made, but is probably the most memorable. The event, held in Washington D.C. is a place where the press and politicians come together every year and, basically, just roast each other. It s supposed to be in good fun   in much the same way you re used to at the annual White House Correspondents Dinner.Biden also took a few jabs at Trump, as well. One made fun of former Speaker of the House John Boehner s fake (orange looking) tan: Donald has attacked every person of color   except John Boehner. Chris Christie (if you ve been keeping up with the news) has been getting some serious flak for the way he looked standing behind Donald Trump during a press conference last week, so Biden joked about that, as well. Chris Christie swears he wasn t being held captive by Trump, but just take a look at that FACE (in the video below). But folks, on a serious point, Trump said he likes  people who don t get captured. What a terrible thing to say about my friend and a genuine war hero, John McCain. So tonight I call on Donald Trump to be a man of his word   and release Chris Christie right now. Vice-President Biden is a man known for saying what s on his mind. Sometimes he gets in trouble for it but most of the time he just makes us laugh. That joke about Ted Cruz was a good one.Featured image via Wikimedia.",News,"March 6, 2016"
17584,WILL OBAMA REGIME Be Held Accountable For Dirty Tactics They Used To Take Down MICHAEL FLYNN?,"While we re on the subject of lying to the FBI, when will Hillary Clinton be prosecuted for multiple crimes she committed while acting as our Secretary of State?  Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn admitted Friday to making false statements to the FBI, entering the first guilty plea in Special Counsel Robert Mueller s Russia probe   and agreeing to cooperate with investigators.A source close to Flynn said financial and emotional pressure helped lead to the decision to plead guilty, rather than endure a drawn-out court battle.As part of the deal, Flynn already is supplying information about the actions of top Trump transition officials.Though the individuals are not named, court documents show Flynn claiming a  very senior member  of the Trump transition team directed him to contact foreign governments including Russia over a United Nations vote   discussions tied to one of Flynn s false statements.The documents also say Flynn called an unnamed senior transition official in December to ask what to communicate to the Russian ambassador about sanctions. That official and Flynn discussed how they didn t want Russia to  escalate the situation,  something Flynn immediately told the ambassador in a phone call.According to the plea deal, Flynn has agreed to  cooperate fully, truthfully, completely and forthrightly  with the probe, with sentencing delayed until those efforts  have been completed. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, becomes the first Trump ex-White House official charged in the special counsel probe.His tenure at the White House was brief   he was fired for similar conduct, pertaining to his undisclosed discussions with the Russians   and Flynn had been under investigation even before the special counsel probe over lobbying work for Turkey and other issues. The fact that he faced just one count prompted immediate speculation Friday that Flynn was cooperating and offering information to Mueller s team.As for the past discussions between Flynn and transition officials, it s unclear which senior officials the plea deal referred to. But a former senior intelligence officer with knowledge of Trump transition activities told Fox News that then-President-Elect Trump directed Flynn during that period to contact the Russians   while also directing him and his team to contact 12 other countries. The transition team felt that the Obama White House had completely abandoned any coherent foreign policy and had to fill the vacuum,  the former official told Fox News.In a statement, White House lawyer Ty Cobb said  nothing  about the plea implicates anyone other than Flynn. NBC News tweeted Cobb s statement:Today, Michael Flynn, a former National Security Advisor at the White House for 25 days during the Trump Administration, and a former Obama administration official, entered a guilty plea to a single count of making a false statement to the FBI. The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year. Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn. The conclusion of this phase of the Special Counsel s work demonstrates again that the Special Counsel is moving with all deliberate speed and clears the way for a prompt and reasonable conclusion.

Jack Posobiec   (@JackPosobiec) December 1, 2017Watch Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton and ACLJ President Jay Sekulow lay out the case against Barack Obama officials and the felonies they committed when they leaked and improperly disseminate classified information and unmask members of the Trump transition team. Jay Sekulow explains to Sean Hannity, that,  The concern is the intelligence apparatus in the United States has rules, that they have to follow, like every other agency, and it appears that in the waning days, or maybe the last year of the former administration, they viewed those laws as advisory opinions and not law. When the unmasking allegations first surfaced, Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) had plenty to say about the unmasking of Michael Flynn.On March 19, 2017, George Stephanopolis asked Senator Rand Paul about his thoughts on the unmasking of Michael Flynn. Senator Paul suggested that the person responsible for unmasking General Flynn should be in jail. Paul went on to say that you cannot allow this unmasking to take place,  or we will have presidents being blackmailed or national security advisers being blackmailed. Here s an excerpt from their conversation published by Politico:STEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, sir, you re also a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. WE see the president standing by that claim about President Obama. It s caused a rift now with British intelligence over the weekend. How big a problem is this for the president s credibility? How does he fix it?PAUL: I think that we know one thing for sure, that the Obama administration did spy on Flynn. Now, whether it was direct or indirect, somebody was reading and taking   a transcript of his phone calls and then they released it.It is very, very important that whoever released that go to jail, because you cannot have members of the intelligence community listening to the most private and highly classified information and then releasing that to The New York Times.There can only be a certain handful of people who did that. I would bring them all in. They would have to take lie detector tests. And I would say, including the political people, because some political people knew about this as well.But we need to get to the bottom of who is releasing these highly classified conversations. And if the president was surveilled, he probably wasn t the target. I don t know that he was or wasn t. But if he was, they probably targeted someone in a foreign government, but then they listened to the conversation with Americans.STEPHANOPOULOS; You don t believe President Obama ordered an illegal wiretap of President Trump?PAUL: Well, what happens is it s different than that. We target foreigners all the time, but they talk to Americans. They talk to the president. They talk to the national security advisers. And they re supposed to be masked.But there was something alarming the other day. General Hayden admitted that people all the way down to some of the lowest analysts can unmask who the American is. So, someone unmasked General Flynn and they re a low-level analyst, we need to be looking at their computer and find out if they unmasked that conversation and if they spoke with The New York Times you have got to put those people in jail, because you cannot allow this to happen, or we will have presidents being blackmailed or national security advisers being blackmailed.This is a huge, huge problem, bigger than anything else that s being discussed is the fact that private conversations from the intelligence community s perspective are being leaked to the press. That s not like a leak that says, oh, the president watches TV in his bathrobe, this is important to national security, you can t let it happen.Rand Paul was asked again about the unmasking of Michael Flynn on MSNBC s Morning Joe show. Paul told the leftist hosts backdoor searches are illegal and that they could be politicized. Paul said that Susan Rice should be placed under subpoena and she should be asked:  Did you talk to the President about this and did President Obama know about this?    Paul went on to say that the Susan Rice  unmasking  was a witch hunt started by the Obama administration because of sour grapes on the way  out the door.

1889, Heroin Addict Trump Voter Sad Now That Donald Is Taking Away His Treatments (VIDEO),"Pennsylvania resident Kurt Farmer was perfectly fine with building a wall to keep brown people out of the country, banning Muslims from entering the United States, and Donald Trump s other horrifying policies, but he (like the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups who backed Trump during the election) also made the mistake of believing that The Donald had his interests as a white man at heart.Unfortunately, as a recovering heroin addict, Farmer is now suffering quite a bit of buyer s remorse after learning that his treatments are going to go bye-bye under Trump. Farmer relies on Medicaid to pay for his recovery treatments, and Trump is currently in the process of trying to gut healthcare for all those dirty poors in the country who act like the Constitution guarantees the right to  life  or something. If I didn t have Medicaid, I wouldn t be able to pay for this,  Farmer told CNN.  I would like to say I wouldn t relapse but the chances are from past experience, if I m not going to treatment, in a matter of a few weeks I start getting high. Farmer recently learned   like the rest of us   that the White House intends to allow states to opt out of the Essential Health Benefits regulations under Obamacare   the very same ones that force private insurers and Medicaid to pay for substance abuse recovery.Farmer is the most recent in Trump voters who have lost the faith   but only after learning that they would be hurt by his policies just as much as immigrants, Muslims, and others Trump and his supporters view as Untermensch.This is the difference between conservatives and the rest of us: While we realized The Donald is bad for America as a whole, they waited until he was bad for them to care.Watch the CNN segment below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"April 5, 2017"
14627,HOLY BETRAYAL OF AMERICA’S NATIONAL SECURITY: New Evidence Shows Hillary Emailed “Most Secretive” Classified Material On Private Unsecured Server,"She s the most dangerous, self-centered woman in America Hillary for Prison 2016.  Hillary Clinton s emails on her unsecured, homebrew server contained intelligence from the U.S. government s most secretive and highly classified programs, according to an unclassified letter from a top inspector general to senior lawmakers.Fox News exclusively obtained the unclassified letter, sent Jan. 14 from Intelligence Community Inspector General I. Charles McCullough III. It laid out the findings of a recent comprehensive review by intelligence agencies that identified  several dozen  additional classified emails   including specific intelligence known as  special access programs  (SAP).That indicates a level of classification beyond even  top secret,  the label previously given to two emails found on her server, and brings even more scrutiny to the presidential candidate s handling of the government s closely held secrets. To date, I have received two sworn declarations from one [intelligence community] element. These declarations cover several dozen emails containing classified information determined by the IC element to be at the confidential, secret, and top secret/sap levels,  said the IG letter to lawmakers with oversight of the intelligence community and State Department.  According to the declarant, these documents contain information derived from classified IC element sources. Intelligence from a  special access program,  or SAP, is even more sensitive than that designated as  top secret    as were two emails identified last summer in a random sample pulled from Clinton s private server she used as secretary of state. Access to a SAP is restricted to those with a  need-to-know  because exposure of the intelligence would likely reveal the source, putting a method of intelligence collection   or a human asset   at risk. Currently, some 1,340 emails designated  classified  have been found on Clinton s server, though the Democratic presidential candidate insists the information was not classified at the time. There is absolutely no way that one could not recognize SAP material,  a former senior law enforcement with decades of experience investigating violations of SAP procedures told Fox News.  It is the most sensitive of the sensitive. Executive Order 13526   called  Classified National Security Information  and signed Dec. 29, 2009   sets out the legal framework for establishing special access programs. The order says the programs can only be authorized by the president,  the Secretaries of State, Defense, Energy, and Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence, or the principal deputy of each. The programs are created when  the vulnerability of, or threat to, specific information is exceptional,  and  the number of persons who ordinarily will have access will be reasonably small and commensurate with the objective of providing enhanced protection for the information involved,  it states.According to court documents, former CIA Director David Petraeus was prosecuted for sharing intelligence from special access programs with his biographer and mistress Paula Broadwell. At the heart of his prosecution was a non-disclosure agreement where Petraeus agreed to protect these closely held government programs, with the understanding  unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized retention or negligent handling   could cause irreparable injury to the United States or be used to advantage by a foreign nation.  Clinton signed an identical non-disclosure agreement Jan. 22, 2009.While the State Department and Clinton campaign have said the emails in questions were  retroactively classified  or  upgraded    to justify the more than 1,300 classified emails on her server   those terms are meaningless under federal law.The former federal law enforcement official said the finding in the January IG letter represents a potential violation of USC 18 Section 793,  gross negligence  in the handling of secure information under the Espionage Act.

15262,MUST SEE RESULTS OF NEW POLL Asking Americans One Word They Associate With Hillary,"Somehow we don t think this is what the Queen of the Clinton Crime Syndicate expected at this stage of her campaign The latest Q-poll numbers have dropped and there aren t really a lot of surprises in the top lines. (Well  there are a couple of exceptions but we ll get to those in a minute.) What was really startling, though, was the results of the  open ended  questions about several of the candidates. Most specifically, the massively leading, top of the list responses for Hillary Clinton have to be giving her team nightmares. (Connecticut Post  emphasis added)Clinton leads the Democratic field with 45 percent, down from 55 percent July 30, with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 22 percent and Biden at 18 percent.

The owners didn t hire Goodell to be their social justice director Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones led a conference call with 17 NFL owners on Thursday to discuss the possibility of halting commissioner Roger Goodell s pending contract extension.The owners on Thursday s conference call are unhappy with Goodell and the NFL s front office for a variety of reasons, including the player protests staged during the national anthem, issues regarding the relocation of teams to Los Angeles and the league s handling of the Ray Rice domestic violence case, sources told ESPN. You don t get to have this many messes over the years like Roger has had and survive it,  one owner said during the call.Sources have previously said that Jones has tried to stand in the way of any extension for Goodell.Last month, ESPN reported that Jones was impeding the progress of contract negotiations aimed at an extension for Goodell.  If not for Jerry,  one owner said last month in regard to the contract negotiations,  this deal would be done. The tension between Jones and Goodell is in part credited to the commissioner giving Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott a six-game suspension, which is currently being disputed in court.Another factor in the frustration with Goodell is the controversy surrounding players kneeling during the national anthem.Goodell won t mandate the players stand while Jones is threatening Cowboys onto their feet.Earlier this month, Jones said that any of his players who  disrespect  the flag won t be allowed to play. I know this, we cannot in the NFL in any way give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag,  Jones, also the team s general manager, said after a 35-31 loss to the Green Bay Packers on October 8.The previous week, Jones knelt along with head coach Jason Garrett and all their players in the middle of the field on September 26 in a show of unity before they all stood for the anthem before their 28-17 win over the Arizona Cardinals. Spoke to Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys yesterday. Jerry is a winner who knows how to get things done. Players will stand for Country!

17121,BREAKING DISCOVERY: CLINTON FOUNDATION SHARED EMAIL SERVER LOCATION WITH HILLARY’S SECRET SERVER,"The news gets worse every day for the Clinton Crime Syndicate Breitbart News Exclusive: Hillary Clinton s private email server was housed at the same physical location and on the same network as an email server used and operated by the Clinton Foundation, Breitbart News has exclusively learned.Records reveal that Hillary Clinton s private clintonemail.com server shared an IP address with her husband Bill Clinton s email server, presidentclinton.com, and both servers were housed in New York City, not in the basement of the Clintons  Chappaqua, New York home.Web archives show that the Presidentclinton.com Web address was being operated by the Clinton Foundation as of 2009, when Hillary Clinton registered her own clintonemail.com server.Numerous Clinton Foundation employees used the presidentclinton.com server for their own email addresses, which means that they were using email accounts that, if hacked, would have given any hacker complete access to Hillary Clinton s State Department emails, as well.The bombshell revelation raises new concerns about the possible illegality of Hillary Clinton s private email use. The former Secretary of State is under federal investigation for potentially violating the Espionage Act by allowing people without a security clearance to access classified information. The fact that Hillary was sharing an email network with a private foundation means that people without a security clearance almost certainly had physical access to her server while she was working at the State Department.Here s what we know:The Servers Have The SAME IP AddressHillary s clintonemail.com server and the Foundation-run presidentclinton.com email server have exactly the same IP address, and the same SSL certificate (which an organization purchases for an email server to verify its trustworthiness).mail.clintonemail.com and mail.presidentclinton.com both have an IP address of 64.94.172.146, according to an SSL Certificate Checker.The two servers both have that same IP address, 64.94.172.146, according to DNS records. (Here are records for Hillary s server, and here are records for Bill s server).Both servers have the same IP address, according to another independent Internet records database, robtex.net.The fact that both of these email servers have the same IP address means that they were operating on the same network, and sharing physical space. A computer expert tells Breitbart News that the servers were probably operating on the same machine. It is also possible that they were operating on different machines on the same network, which still means that the machines would have to be close enough to exist in the same physical location.President Clinton s server was created in 2002, while Hillary s was created in 2009, which means that Hillary s server was simply added to Bill s Foundation-run server network.They Had The SAME IP Address When She Was Secretary of StateHillary s server and Bill s Foundation-run server also shared a different IP address during her tenure as Secretary of State.From September 8, 2009 until June 24, 2011, Bill Clinton s Foundation-run mail.presidentclinton.com server had an IP address of 24.187.234.187, according to DNS records.Hillary s mail.clintonemail.com server had the same exact IP address, 24.187.234.187, from the dates May 21, 2010 until October 21, 2010, according to DNS records.Their Shared IP Address Can Be Traced to Midtown ManhattanA geographical search for the IP address that both servers shared at registration traces to Midtown Manhattan, according to three different databases: infosniper.net, which locates a Midtown latitude/longitude point, ip-tracker.org, which also gives a Midtown latitude/longitude point, and whatsmyip.org.Clinton Foundation headquarters are currently located at 1271 6th Avenue in Midtown. Bill Clinton s office is at 55 West 125th StreetThe Denver-based firm Platte River Networks told Breitbart News that it physically moved Hillary Clinton s private email server out of the basement of her Chappaqua home in 2013. But the Clintons could have moved the server from Manhattan to Chappaqua before Platte River got there.Clinton Founation Employees Had presidentclinton.com email addressesThe employees who have used presidentclinton.com email addresses included former Bill Clinton right-hand man Doug Band, as well as Justin Cooper, a Hillary aide who has worked with the Foundation, Terry Krinvic, Laura Graham, and John Zimmerebner.Was Chelsea Clinton On The Server?The email server for mail.chelseaoffice.com, which is no longer active, resolves to clintonemail.com, according to DNS records. Wikileaks confirms that the chelseaoffice.com server was used by Chelsea Clinton employees.Hillary Even Admitted That She Used Her Husband s  System Well the system we used was set up for President Clintons office and it had numerous safeguards it was on property guarded by the Secret Service and there were no security breaches, so I think that the use of that server which started with my husband proved to be effective and secure,  Hillary Clinton said in a March 2015 press conference.Clinton has not returned to that talking point since.The Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton s campaign did not return requests for comment by press time.

5252, The NFL Puts Trump In A VERY Awkward Position Over His Whining About The Debate Schedule,"The presidential debate schedule is already out, and, true to form, Donald Trump is already throwing a livid fit about it. He doesn t like the fact that two of the debates are scheduled on the same nights as NFL games, which would be understandable if he wasn t busy saying Hillary Clinton is responsible for that. However, he crossed a major line in his accusations, and it has already come back to bite him hard.In an interview with ABC News, he made the following ridiculous claim: Well, I ll tell you what I don t like. It s against two NFL games. I got a letter from the NFL saying,  This is ridiculous. Why are the debates against   cause the NFL doesn t wanna go against the debates.  Cause the debates are gonna be pretty massive, from what I understand, OK? And I don t think we should be against the NFL. Now, aside from the obvious questions of why the NFL would be sending Trump a letter about this, rather than the Commission on Presidential Debates, it appears that this is one of Trump s most blatant lies yet. CNN s Brian Stetler says the NFL responded by disavowing any contact with Trump at all: While we d obviously wish the debate commission could find another night, we did not send a letter to Trump. And there it is. Most politicians who are given to lies will at least attempt to lie in such a way that it s hard to prove, even with a statement from whomever or whatever they re lying about. Not Trump! No he s so important that it doesn t matter that the debate schedule has been in place for a year already. Agencies like the NFL will communicate to him first, because he s just that crucial to the whole process.Why is this significant? Because it s not a gaffe. A gaffe is when a politician, pundit, or someone else heavily involved in politics accidentally lets loose what s really on their minds. Romney s 47 percent comment four years ago is a gaffe. Trump, however, commits gaffes and also tells outright lies.

18529,"“DRIVE THEM OUT OF YOUR PLACES OF WORSHIP!” London Imams Take President Trump’s Advice, REFUSE To Perform Funeral Rights For Islamic Terrorists [VIDEO]","President Trump gave a powerful speech to Arab leaders at the opening of the new Global Centre for Combatting Extremist Ideology in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on May 21, 2017. In his historic speech, President Trump warned Islamic extremists:  If you choose terror, your life will be brief and your life will be empty.  Trump went on to tell the Arab leaders and the entire world, We are not here to lecture and tell you how to live. We are here to work together to meet one goal and meet history s great test to conquer extremism. Young Muslim boys and girls should be able to grow up free from fear, safe from violence and innocent of hatred. Young Muslims should be able to build prosperity for themselves. This will be the beginning of the end for those who fight terror. This special gathering will one day be remembered as the start of peace in the Middle East and potentially all over the world. Watch the clip of President Trump telling Arab leaders in Riyadh and around the world to  drive out terrorism  from their nations and from their places of worship:It appears that the Imams in London were listening after East London Mosque and London Muslim Centre Chairman Muhammad Habibur-Rahman boldly announced to Muslims everywhere that if they commit acts of terror against innocent people, they will not receive funeral rights in London mosques.British police on Tuesday named the final member of the terror trio that murdered seven people on Saturday in a knife and van attack before police shot the jihadis dead   and the news comes as more than 130 Muslim religious leaders were refusing to say funeral prayers for any members of the ISIS cell.The decision by the Muslim leaders was seen as an  unprecedented  move because the funeral ritual is typically performed on a deceased Muslim no matter the person s past actions. The group of religious leaders have urged others to join them in declining to pray for the dead killers. We, as Muslim imams and religious leaders, condemn the recent terror attacks in Manchester and London in the strongest terms possible,  the Muslim leaders said in a statement.  Coming from a range of backgrounds, and from across the U.K.; feeling the pain the rest of the nation feels, we have come together to express our shock and utter disgust at these cold-blooded murders. We are deeply hurt that a spate of terror attacks have been committed in our country once more by murderers who seek to gain religious legitimacy for their actions. We seek to clarify that their reprehensible actions have neither legitimacy nor our sympathy. East London Mosque and London Muslim Centre Chairman Muhammad Habibur-Rahman said the decision was made because  those who perpetrate terrorism: you are against the very core teaching of Islam and of our Prophet Muhammad. Your misguidance will lead you to destruction, and God willing you will utterly fail in your evil aims,  he said in a statement.The decision underscores a warning President Trump issued to the Islamic world last month. Speaking in Riyadh before the leaders of 50 Muslim majority countries, Trump told warned terrorists that taking innocent lives would not lead to eternal paradise. If you choose the path of terror, your life will be empty, your life will be brief, and your soul will be fully condemned,  Trump said.U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also applauded the move. He said he was encouraged by the imams and said that the decision means  they re condemning their souls  since the funeral prayer asks for forgiveness of the dead. And that is what has to be done,  he said.Youssef Zaghba, a Moroccan-born Italian man, was identified Tuesday morning as the final member of the trio that descended upon the London Bridge on Saturday.Mak Chishty, the Metropolitan police commander of engagement, said, according to The Guardian, that it is time for Muslims to  counter the scourge of terrorism, extremism and hatred that we have in our communities at present. Chishty, the highest-ranking officer in the department of Muslim faith, said,  It is the Islamic duty of every Muslim to be loyal to the country in which they live. We are now asking questions to understand how extremism and hatred has taken hold within some elements of our own communities.   FOX News ",left-news,"Jun 6, 2017"
10318,MASSACHUSETTS VOTES TO IGNORE FED LAW and Let Illegals Go…This Sanctuary State Endangers All Americans!,"MASSACHUSETTS IS NOW A SANCTUARY STATE! The Massachusetts Supreme Court just ruled that illegals are to be released and not held under federal law. This puts all Americans at risk! Tucker Carlson previously interviewed a State Rep. who supports subverting federal law. Please listen to the skewed reasoning for not following federal law:In a ruling hailed by civil liberties advocates that ends a longstanding immigration enforcement practice, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court declared Monday that current state law  provides no authority for Massachusetts court officers to arrest and hold an individual solely on the basis of a Federal civil immigration detainer, beyond the time that the individual would otherwise be entitled to be released from State custody. State Representative James Lyons, an Andover Republican, said he is working with Republican Representatives Marc Lombardo of Billerica, and Shaunna O Connell of Taunton to gather co-sponsors on a bill he plans to file Tuesday or Wednesday. Lyons said the bill would be  straightforward,  giving Massachusetts police and court officers the power to arrest someone on a civil immigration warrant.  People are concerned about the rule of law,  Lyons told the News Service. Asked about how he thought the bill would fare in the Democrat-controlled Legislature, Lyons said,  Beacon Hill, I can t predict what s going on up there.  While the high court ruling focused on court officers, advocates said the opinion prohibits any state official from keeping someone jailed solely at the request of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  Going forward, nobody in Massachusetts should be held on an immigration detainer unless the Legislature were to attempt to change that,  said Emma Winger, Immigration Impact Unit staff attorney for the Committee on Public Counsel Services, who argued the case before the Supreme Judicial Court in April. It applies to anybody with arrest authority,  said Laura Rotolo, staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts. Rotolo said that while many jurisdictions have limited their cooperation with ICE, the SJC is the first state high court to rule against ICE detainers.Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson said the decision will make people more vulnerable to crime in Massachusetts.  I wouldn t say it makes Massachusetts a sanctuary state. I think it makes Massachusetts more vulnerable   the people who live here and people who visit here   more vulnerable to become victims of crime, and also a further message to people throughout the country who are here illegally that we re the place you want to come,  Hodgson said.Read more: New Boston Post",politics,"Jul 25, 2017"
18345,KELLYANNE CONWAY Slaps Down Rabid CNN Host Chris Cuomo: “Aren’t you the least bit embarrassed that you now talk about Russia more than you talk about America?” [VIDEO],"Chris Cuomo of fake news network CNN interviewed Kellyanne Conway on Sunday. You would have thought by now, these hacks at CNN would have figured out they are no match for the brilliant Kellyanne Conway. At the opening of his interview with Conway, Cuomo attempted to convince the few viewers who still watch CNN that President Trump was  very squishy  on his meeting with Vladimir Putin. Kellyanne Conway snapped back in her usual calm but witty way,  Chris, let s back up. So you re saying you used the word squishy which, itself, is unusual to describe the president s state of mind. So somehow that makes people on CNN insist that the president is never going to raise this with Putin? Why are they still in there?  Cuomo responded,  It s not about CNN. It s about what the president said, Kellyanne.  Kellyanne immediately landed a right hook to fake news host Chris Cuomo when she asked him,  Aren t you the least bit reluctant, if not embarrassed that you now talk about Russia more than you talk about America? Cuomo went on to discuss the nothing-burger story about a meeting Donald Trump Jr. had with a Russian lawyer prior to the election. The lawyer allegedly claimed he had information about individuals connected to Russian that were funding the DNC and Hillary. It turns out she was a human rights lawyer who wanted to talk about adoption. But CNN, who suffers from Trump-Russia collusion obsession, is clinging to this story like a squirrel protects its only nut in the dead of winter. Again, Conway delivered another knock out blow saying,  you keep on saying opposition research the way you guys constantly vomit words like collusion and Russian interference and affecting the election, all of which you have no evidence. We cannot convert wishful thinking into hard evidence. Watch: ",left-news,"Jul 10, 2017"

Hodgkinson opened fire on Republican lawmakers practicing for a charity baseball game in Alexandria, Va., wounding five people including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.). Hodgkinson had penned a Facebook rant against Handel last week. My thoughts are with the victims of this morning s despicable, unprovoked attack on the Republican congressional softball team,  wrote Handel, Georgia s former secretary of state.  Representative Scalise is a friend, and my heart goes out to him and his family. Steve and I wish him and the others wounded a speedy recovery. They remain in our thoughts and prayers. I also want to commend the heroic actions of the Capitol Police officers who clearly prevented today s attack from being a much bigger tragedy,  she wrote.Handel also addressed expletive comments that Hodgkinson made about her on social media.Hodgkinson posted an article about Handel to his Facebook, calling her a  Republican Bitch  who wants  People to Work for Slave Wages,  NBC affiliate WXIA reported. Republican Bitch Wants People to Work for Slave Wages, when a Livable Wage is the Only Way to Go! Vote Blue, It s Right for You!  Hodgkinson wrote on Facebook. I am aware that the suspect recently made vile comments about me on social media,  Handel said in her statement.  It also appears that the suspect targeted members of Congress specifically because he disagreed with their views. Hodgkinson s social media posts indicate he was a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) and loathed President Donald Trump and Republican policies.Handel echoed calls by others, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.), for bipartisan unity following the attack. We should not allow our political differences to escalate to violent attacks. We must all refuse to allow the politics of our country to be defined in this way,  she wrote.

341, Anti-Porn GOP Florida Lawmaker Was Just Caught Porning On Twitter,"The GOP has a thing for porn. In 2016, Sen. Todd Weiler introduced legislation asking his state to recognize that porn is creating a public health hazard and Republicans thought that was a cool idea. Well, now it s 2017 and a Florida lawmaker who filed a similar proposal was just busted favoriting a porn tweet. You could say he got Ted Cruzed.Just a few days ago, State Rep. Ross Spano filed a bill to declare pornography a public health crisis in Florida, but from his Twitter account, it appears he  liked  a pornographic tweet.According to the Orlando Weekly, the Republican s list of likes on Twitter is typically football clips, Bible verses, and GOP-related content about how evil Islam is. But, nestled into his  likes  list is a tweet from Jan. 8 by the  Goddess Lesbian  Twitter account, which features a video clip from adult entertainment company Reality Kings. On that same day, Spano liked a Biblical quote-tweet from Franklin Graham but we re not sure if that was before or after he was watching lesbians having sexy-time in front of the camera.Screenshot!This wouldn t matter in the least except for the bill Spano filled, HR157, which the Orlando Weekly notes is  incredibly harsh on adult content  and he left that  liked  porn tweet up for nine months. It appears to be deleted now. Franklin Graham s liked tweet is still there, though.The bill, which is contrary to research, states that  recent research indicates that pornography is potentially biologically addictive, resulting in the user consuming increasingly more shocking material to satisfy the addiction,  and adds,  Pornography has a detrimental effect on families and is linked to a reluctance to enter into marriage, dissatisfaction in marriage and marital infidelity. Spano says he didn t do it. It wasn t him being horny on Twitter.Obviously, I have a long social media history on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram since I was first elected in 2012. With a thorough examination of my accounts, it will be easy to see that this is not my doing. I have since gone back, once notified, and rectified the problem. And I m now looking into how it occurred in the first place.In addition, referencing my prior statement, I don t believe any of this takes the focus off of the fact that there is a direct correlation between pornography and a host of societal problems, including human trafficking, exploitation of children, sex slavery, and domestic violence.Sure, it wasn t Spano, it must have been that other Spano guy with the same Twitter account and password. Sounds legit!Image via YouTube screen capture.",News,"September 21, 2017"

6660, Bigoted Cops Shove Lesbian Out Of Women’s Bathroom Because She Looks Like A Man (VIDEO),"The hopes and dreams of millions of bigots finally came true when three cops on a power trip confronted a lesbian in a public restroom and shoved her outside. Why? Because they  thought  she was a guy.In a video titled  Lesbian harassed and forced to leave a public restroom because the police insist she s a man, three officers, two males and a female, can be seen in a public women s restroom telling a woman referred to her friends as a  dyke  that she has to leave. This is despite the fact that several of her friends are standing right there telling the cops that she is, in fact, a girl.Now to be fair to the cops, the woman in question didn t have ID and was dressed like a guy because women NEVER do that in America. Completely unheard of. And, even worse, she was fairly flat chested and that s something else that s simply inconceivable. Everyone knows that woman always have curves so you can identify them as chicks. So, clearly, there was absolutely no WAY the cops could know whether or not this was a woman.Other than, you know, the woman and her friends saying that she was. But since when do whiny civilians know better than the police? Frankly, I m surprised they didn t force her to drop her pants to prove it.Here s the disturbing video:This is exactly the kind of prejudice Republicans have been hoping to inspire with their  Bathroom Laws.  They know that people only need the thinnest of justifications to vent their hate and we see here the result. As far as I m concerned, the cops knew damn well that she wasn t a man or they would have arrested her. That they didn t even threaten it tells me that bullying was the intent and nothing else. Again, exactly what Republicans wanted.The right has lost the culture war against the LGBT community and what we re witnessing now is the last desperate attempts by bigots to turn back the clock to  better times.  I hope this woman sues the crap out of the police for violating her civil rights and they all lose their jobs.

18827,"LIBERAL Lansing, MI Mayor Forced To REMOVE “Sanctuary City” Status After MI Residents Hammer Him For Arrogant Announcement On Tucker Carlson [VIDEO]","Watch his appearance on Tucker Carlson where he announced that Lansing, MI would be designated a  sanctuary city  here:The city council in Lansing, Mich. voted Wednesday to rescind its decision to deem itself a  sanctuary  city for illegal immigrants after concerns from the businesses that the status would draw unwelcome attention to the city.The term  sanctuary city  generally refers to jurisdictions that do not cooperate with U.S. immigration officials. Under Lansing city policy, police don t ask for people s immigration status, except as required by U.S. or Michigan law or a court order.Council members voted 5-2 to reverse last week s 6-0 vote to give the city  sanctuary  status. Immigration advocates in the crowd called called council members  spineless  and said  you re all losing your seats. The dispute comes as several cities are battling President Donald Trump s promised crackdown on places that block cooperation between their police departments and U.S. immigration authorities. The Trump administration has warned that sanctuary cities could lose federal money for refusing to cooperate with immigration authorities.After last week s vote, council members received a letter from the Lansing Regional Chamber and Michigan Chamber of Commerce urging them to remove references to  sanctuary city  from its resolution. Lansing is a diverse community, rich with history and culture. It s what makes our city a welcoming destination to live, work and thrive,  the business groups  letter says.  Recent actions of City Council, whether intended or not, have placed an unnecessary target on the City of Lansing while jeopardizing millions of dollars in federal funding that impacts the city budget. The term  sanctuary  in the resolution has become very problematic and distracting   so distracting in my opinion that s it s taken away from the intent of our resolution, which is to protect individuals,  said Councilwoman Judi Brown Clarke.  It s basically a  don t ask  policy, which was outlined by the mayor s executive order and what we had in our policy complements that. That was already the policy in Lansing before last week s vote, but Lansing called itself a  welcoming city,  rather than a  sanctuary city.  Neither the welcoming city resolution nor the sanctuary city resolution called for Lansing to prohibit workers from providing information on a person s immigration status with U.S. immigration officials   a ban that s at the heart of some urban sanctuary cities disagreements with the Trump administration.The issue also has touched off debate in the Republican-controlled Michigan Legislature, which is considering banning local governments from enacting or enforcing rules that limit communication and cooperation with federal officials concerning people s immigration status.

6977, Report: Turns Out Most Of Trump’s ‘Charity’ Was Giving Free Golf To His Business Friends,"Given the fact that Donald Trump has often bragged that he intentionally used his numerous bankruptcies as a way to exploit the government (and taxpayers) into paying his debts, it s not exactly surprising to learn that the billionaire business mogul has a spotty track record with philanthropy, but the scope of his greed, revealed in a new deep dive analysis by the Washington Post, is shocking.Trump loves to brag that he has given over $100 million to charity in the past five years, but like nearly everything the Republican frontrunner says, the truth is much different. Trump published a list of 4,844  contributions  he s made, which seems impressive until you actually start to look at what the donations are.As the Washington Post discovered: many of the gifts that Trump cited to prove his generosity were free rounds of golf, given away by his courses for charity auctions and raffles.Trump s campaign also counted a parcel of land that he d given to New York state   although that was in 2006, not within the past five years.The Donald J. Trump Foundation, Trump s biggest charity, was especially notable for its lack of well Trump. Between 2008 and 2014, Trump didn t donate a single penny of his own money to the foundation, instead he leaned on rich friends to give their money and he then sent out the checks to the charities under his name. What a guy.And while some of that money undeniable went to good causes, Trump also used a lot of his  donations  to shore up his political and business interests. The Washington Post again:His foundation, for example, frequently gave money to groups that paid to use Trump s facilities, and it donated to conservatives who could help promote Trump s rise in the Republican Party. The foundation s second-biggest donation described on the campaign s list went to the charity of a man who had settled a lawsuit with one of Trump s golf courses after being denied a hole-in-one prize.Trump s campaign had a truly stunning response when asked to explain why Trump s charitable giving was so weak: They didn t want to make Trump an easy mark for other charities. We want to keep them quiet,  said Weisselberg, who is also treasurer of the Trump Foundation.  He doesn t want other charities to see it. Then it becomes like a feeding frenzy. Amazing. Absolutely amazing.And while Trump certainly isn t the only rich person to horde his money for himself, his friends, and his business interests, it s worth noting that other billionaires have rejected this egregious level of greed and actually given vast amounts of their wealth to real, world-changing causes. Bill Gates, for example, has given $28 billion already and he says he s not done. It wasn t given to give friends free tickets to a game of golf, either. Gates and his wife have spent years fighting to eradicate the scourge of polio off the face of the earth, something he calls  a gift for the rest of time. Likewise, Warren Buffett set a charity record in June 2015   around the time Trump was teasing his presidential run   by donating $2.8 billion in one lump sum.Donald Trump has gotten pretty far in the election by impressing his supporters with his wealth. Many cite his business skills (debatable as they are) as the primary reason they will vote for him. However, is it not just as important to see what he does with the money once he has it? Unlike other people fortunate enough to have billions, it s clear he believes giving away his money to fight disease, poverty, or other social causes is a waste. He s repeatedly taken advantage of his wealth to influence people and get ahead.Somebody might want to pull him aside and let him know that money isn t something you can take with you when you die. He may even thank you for the advice with a free golf pass.Featured image via Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images",News,"April 10, 2016"
14974,“G#d d*mn America”: DISTURBING PHOTOS Illustrate Obama’s “Diplomacy” Failure In Iran,"Yes this massive protest against America just happened today! Thousands of Iranians burned the American flag and chanted slogans Wednesday as they marked the anniversary of the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by militant students 36 years ago.The annual state-organized rally drew greater attention this year, as Iranian hard-liners look to counter moderate President Hassan Rouhani s outreach to the West following a landmark nuclear deal reached with world powers in July. An Iranian official also chose the occasion to announce the arrest of an unspecified number of allegedly pro-American writers.The hard-liners fear Rouhani s efforts to improve relations will pave the way for the United States to undermine and eventually dismantle the Islamic republic formed after the 1979 revolution.On Nov. 4, 1979, militant students stormed the U.S. Embassy compound and took 52 Americans hostage after Washington refused to hand over the toppled U.S.-backed shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, for trial in Iran. The students held the hostages for 444 days, and the two countries have had no diplomatic relations since then.Protesters on Wednesday carried placards reading  political and security penetration is forbidden.  They pumped their fists in the air, shouting  God damn America,  and  No compromise, no surrender to U.S. Others carried banners rejecting U.S. fast food chains McDonald s and Starbucks. Authorities recently closed a newly opened knock-off of KFC, saying it was unlicensed.Hard-liners view fast food outlets and other American products as part of a  cultural invasion  by the U.S. aimed at undermining Islamic rule and public morality.Foreign firms are poised to return to Iran following the lifting of international sanctions under the nuclear deal, but it remains unclear whether American brands will be allowed in.Iran s state TV showed similar demonstrations in other Iranian cities to mark the occasion, known as the  National Day against Global Arrogance. Wednesday s rally in Tehran also saw State Prosecutor Ebrahim Raeisi announce that the intelligence department of the elite Revolutionary Guard had detained a number of writers. The intelligence and security forces identified and cracked down on a network of penetration in media and cyberspace and detained spies and writers hired by Americans,  he told the rally, without elaborating. Under no circumstances will we allow penetration of Americans in economic, social and cultural areas,  he added.Iran has arrested a number of activists, journalists and artists since Rouhani s 2013 election and currently holds four Iranians with U.S. citizenship, including a Washington Post reporter. Analysts say the arrests are the work of hard-liners in the judiciary and the security forces. Via: AP News",politics,"Nov 4, 2015"

(List of states where Penzeys Spice stores are located can be found below)Here is an excerpt from his first letter:Please give us a moment to share something we hope you will find very valuable.Our customers come from all walks of life. The kindness of cooks knows no borders or divides. In the aftermath of the election, seeing the intentional damage inflicted on so many outside the white heterosexual male world, we raised our voice. We felt we had to. We did this because we are Penzeys. The Spice business is so intertwined with history that it s not really possible to have one without the other. It became clear to us that we are now in a moment history will long have its eyes upon. For the sake of our customers, and for the sake of future generations, we felt the time had come to stand on the right side of history.And while the reasons for why we took a stand might be specific to our unique outlook, what we learned actually applies to all commerce in the United States. What we learned is that President-elect Donald Trump has no real support. Voters, sure, but no constituency. Running a campaign on  that horrible-terrible-woman who should be locked up,  while at the same time working to raise fear of minorities among white voters with limited access to education, clearly achieved its goal. But none of it left Americans with any sense of connection to the candidate they actually voted for.Willing to take a hit for what is right, we did what we did. In the two weeks since, online sales are up 59.9%, gift box sales up 135%. And we didn t have a catalog arrive in this window this year, while last year we had 1.1 million! Yes, maybe for the moment we have lost 3% of our customers because of the so-called  right wing firestorm.  And, yes, they send emails of rage, and ALL CAPS, and bad language with the hope of creating the perception that they are bigger than they really are. But what we learned is that, in terms of retail spending, Donald Trump simply has no one supporting his views for America. He has no constituency.In this moment there is finally the real chance to unite our nation in our shared rejection of sexism, homophobia, and racism. This is your chance to stand up for America s values and make January a tent pole in your company s history. Opportunities to do the right thing at the time when doing the right thing makes all the difference come once in a lifetime.

6069, Tony Perkins: Christians Are Living In ‘Spiritual Ghettos’ Under Left-Wing Rule (VIDEO),"The Family Research Council s hater-in-chief Tony Perkins is joining his fellow deranged right-wing Christians in insisting that left-wingers are slowly but surely about to outlaw Christianity. He appeared on D. James Kennedy Ministries  Truths That Transform show with the Ministry s president, Frank Wright, and ranted on about how the inability of Christians to force their crazy beliefs on the rest of us somehow means they are being persecuted. Perkins told Wright: We are not disqualified from engaging in the public square simple because we re Christian. And that s where we re at today, where people want us to check our Christian faith at the door of even public service; not just holding public office, but if you re a fireman, a policeman, a teacher, a football coach, you re supposed to leave your faith at home or within the confines of the church. [That is] totally contrary to what the founders envisioned and, I would argue, Frank, totally contrary to what God has called us to do. The thing is, though, the idea that you cannot bring your religious beliefs into doing jobs in public office and other parts of the public sector is NOT persecution, Mr. Perkins. It simply means that you cannot force your beliefs on others in the workplace or in the public sector. That s it. Nothing more or less. Further, it is quite ironic that this man is crying foul on this one, considering that his organization s entire purpose is to strip basic civil rights from anyone and everyone who isn t a right-wing Christian, particularly LGBT people. Hypocrite much?Wright, of course, being just as much of a loon as Perkins, took things a step further, suggesting that any day now, the government would be outlawing the practice of Christianity altogether. Of course, Perkins latched on to this one, and said: We see this administration, we see the left creating these spiritual ghettos where we are forced into, confined to these areas, trying to quarantine faith so it s more easily controllable. Get real, you morons. President Obama isn t trying to get rid of religion; he himself is a Christian. He s just smart enough to know that America was never meant to be a theocracy, that theocracies don t work, and that our Constitution forbids religion in lawmaking.Then again, when deluded individuals such as these two men speak on such matters, facts fly out the window and are replaced with utter lunacy.Get serious help, STAT, both of you.Watch the video of this insanity below, via Right Wing Watch:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"June 1, 2016"
14907,THE WORLD SHOULD BE OUTRAGED By Sweden’s Reward System For Returning Jihadists,"So Sweden basically wants to ensure Muslims returning from raping and beheading innocent people overseas, that the government will help them find a job and receive psychological counseling.  The trauma they must be experiencing after committing Jihad against so many innocent people must be overwhelming   You just can t make these things up The Swedish capital of Stockholm has released its new policy document for dealing with ISIS fighters returning to the city after having had their fill of rape and beheadings of civilians. At first blush it seems strange that such a document would be all of 9 pages.I mean,  Shoot!  should only take up one page, even with a large font.Oh well, let s see how Stockholm intends to handle terrorist-trained and combat-hardened fanatics. Here are a few translated highlights to capture the gist of things: Post-perspective: When a person wishes to leave a violent extremist grouping or coming home from combat overseas, it is crucial to provide customized inclusion efforts. Even then, it is important to have a local cooperation between various actors. Voluntary organizations can provide targeted support and advice. Even faith communities working with advice, but also psychosocial support.When it comes to people who participated in combat there is likely to be great need of health efforts. Therefore, it is important to establish cooperation between social services, social psychiatry and drug units, as well as health centers and psychiatric services (trauma, PTSD, etc.)When it comes to security, it is important that cooperation between social services, income support, employment and other efforts by the Labour Department, as well as assistance with job placement.Finally, the accommodation issue is a prerequisite that must work. Therefore, cooperative housing companies needs to be included in the post-perspective. To summarize: The city of Stockholm will make it a priority to provide the returning ISIS fighters with housing, free health care (physical and mental) and full financial support, until they have received earmarked jobs. All this of course fast-tracked past the line of law-abiding immigrants and indigenous Swedes.Since they now provide all the recruitment incentives for joining ISIS, the only thing missing is a city-run recruitment office. Oh, wait. That would the Employment Office, where it was recently revealed that tax-paid clerks were recruiting for ISIS. Sorry, my mistake!Then it s time to make proactive efforts to discourage radicalization. The solution, the city concludes, is to pour tax money into muslim organizations already in contact with the at-risk persons: Support to associations and other stakeholders locally There are examples of local actors which can contribute to efforts locally. For example, the Islamic Association and the mosque in Rinkeby-Kista has initiated education for interested parents and youths in the J rva area. It is very important to support such local initiatives. It is also important to involve local associations, some of which have contact with residents that the authorities do not come into contact with. As journalist and blogger Per Gudmundson points out, the Islamic Association of Sweden is a remarkably poor choice for  fighting Jihad  since it is the Swedish branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. Their official motto reads: Allah is our goal, the prophet is our leader, the quran is our law, Jihad is our way, and death for the honor of Allah is our greatest desire! Gudmundson notes that they are in active combat in Syria at the moment, in coalition with Jabhat al-Nusrah which is a branch of al-Qaida. Via: The Sweden Report",politics,"Nov 20, 2015"
4579, It Looks Like The Trump Campaign Just Got This Reporter Arrested,"While Donald Trump accuses Hillary Clinton of being crooked and freedom hating, a member of the press was arrested at a his Houston rally after simply inquiring about press credentials.Alex Thompson of Vice News was arrested at the Omni Westside hotel for  trespassing.  Thompson, inquiring as to whether or not his pending press credentials had been approved or denied, entered the hotel lobby to ask members of Trump s communications staff what the final say was.According to Vice News:A man who identified himself as a hotel manager then asked Thompson to leave and warned that he would be arrested if he did not. Roughly two minutes later, without further warning and while Thompson was waiting for a member of Trump s staff to clarify his access to the event, he was arrested by Houston Police, handcuffed, and escorted outside. Thompson spoke with his editors while handcuffed and said that he was never given any opportunity to explain himself to police.And just like that, a reporter was arrested for requesting an answer to his ability to report on the rally, which is his constitutional right.Ryan McCarthy, editor-in-chief of Vice, tweeted:Our reporter @AlxThomp was arrested today outside a Trump event   for doing his job https://t.co/kS2PG5Igyc  Ryan McCarthy (@mccarthyryanj) September 17, 2016Of course the Trump campaign denied any knowing or involvement of the incident, saying,  The campaign was not involved in this incident or aware of the details surrounding it. The event organizers were responsible for today s media presence and requested the campaign limit attendance to the traveling pool. Thompson was released on bond overnight, and the Houston police claimed that he issued an ultimatum: arrest him or leave him alone, because he is not leaving until he gets an answer, as he   a member of the press   is entitled to.Vice has hinted that their lawyers are working on getting the charges dropped.Given Trump and his campaign s hostility to the media (which includes threatening to sue the New York Times, tightening libel laws, and calling CNN panelists a bunch of losers), could having a reporter arrested seem too far out there? The answer is no.Whether or not Trump or anyone in his campaign made the call is not know. But we do know this much: the campaign had his credentials pending; he inquired but to no avail; he inquired again, and was arrested for  trespassing,  even though the event was public.Trump is no friend of the press, or the freedom of the press to report on the asinine and ridiculous things he and his supporters cough up.

5038, BUSTED: Uncovered Video Shows Trump Supporting Hillary In 2008 (VIDEO),"It s not news to say that Donald Trump is a phony. He s neither a great businessman nor as wealthy as he says he is. He contradicts his own words far more often than he contradicts the words of his opponent.So, who is the real Donald Trump, and does he believe a single word of what he says? Well, we can t know that for sure, but what we do know is that in 2008, Trump was a Hillary Clinton supporter. In fact, he called her  fantastic  in a Fox News (yes, Fox News) interview. Now, to be fair, he also said he was a fan of Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney. He also, despite not knowing much about him, called Barack Obama  very capable. Even eight years ago, Trump was asked whether he would ever run for president. He said he would probably never run because -you read this right   he s  too honest. Here s the video:That s wasn t the first or the last time Trump praised the woman who s standing in his way of becoming Dictator in Chief. Last month, Clinton put out an ad showing Trump heaping her with praise.The ad features the words,  Donald Trump reveals the truth about Hillary Clinton  and shows Trump saying on FOX News,  Hillary Clinton, I think, is a terrific woman.  In another clip, Trump praises her and Bill Clinton, saying,  I know her very well and I know her husband very well, and I like them both They are just really terrific people. The ad also quotes Trump praising Hillary Clinton as a  smart, tough and a very nice person,  and said,  She really works hard, and I think she does a good job. Source: TimeDoes it really matter what Trump said about Hillary Clinton in the past? He can t even keep his story straight about what he said yesterday. The damage here is not that he s contradicting himself. His supporters really don t care about that. The damage here is that Trump s supporters hate Hillary Clinton even more than they like Trump.

11487,"SMOKING GUN? First FISA Request on Trump Tower Came After Bill Clinton, Obama’s AG Loretta Lynch Had Private Meeting On Plane","As we said yesterday, Trump would not have made these charges against Obama without having strong evidence. We predict things are about to get even uglier for the crooked Dems On June 27th of 2016, Bill Clinton met secretly with Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.A week later FBI Director James Comey laid out in a press conference the many scandalous activities taken by Hillary Clinton while she was President Obama s Secretary of State and then he said the famous words:Our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case. We now know that the meeting between Bill Clinton and Attorney General Lynch occurred at about the same time that the Obama administration filed a request with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) to monitor communications involving Donald Trump and several advisers.The request, uncharacteristically, was denied.Fast forward to October 2016. Wikileaks began releasing emails of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta, rolling out batches every day until the election, creating new mini-scandals. These emails were virtually ignored by the mainstream media who were in the bag for Democrat Hillary Clinton but were spread widely by websites that chose to share the truth like this one.At the same time, The Obama administration submitted a new, narrow request to the FISA court, now focused on a computer server in Trump Tower suspected of links to Russian banks.At about this same time the leaks started coming. Liberal website Slate posted a report on October 31st titled: Was a Trump Server Communicating With Russia?

5533, WATCH: President Obama Dares Republicans To Support Gun Control To Prove They Care About Cop Safety,"Conservatives talk the talk but can they walk the walk?That s exactly what President Obama dared them to do during a press conference in Warsaw, Poland on Saturday when he asked them to prove they truly care about the lives of police officers by supporting common sense gun measures to make the jobs of cops easier and safer.Republicans have repeatedly blamed President Obama and Black Lives Matter for the killing of five police officers in Dallas, Texas all while professing their own love of police officers and concern for their safety.President Obama told reporters that police have a tough job to do and made it clear that the actions of the Dallas shooter should not be assumed to be supported by all black people just as people did not blame all white people for the Charleston church shooting in South Carolina. When some white kid walks into a church and shoots a bunch of worshipers who invite him to worship with them we don t assume somehow he s making a political statement that s relevant to the attitudes of the rest of America. And we shouldn t make those assumptions about a troubled Muslim individual who is acting on their own in that same way. President Obama then moved on to speak about guns and the role they play in these tragedies. I am going to keep talking about the fact that we cannot eliminate all racial tension in our country overnight. We are not going to be able to identify ahead of time and eliminate every madman or troubled individual who might want to do harm against innocent people. But we can make it harder for them to do so. President Obama mentioned the harrowing number of gun violence incidents that have occurred in this country for the last ten years, pointing out that there is a  pattern  of gun violence that makes America  unique in the scale of violence that we experience  including mass shootings and gun murders we mostly consider  routine.  President Obama mentioned his hometown of Chicago as an example.President Obama then made a connection between all of these shootings and the lack of gun restrictions that make it harder for people officers to do their jobs. Part of what s creating tensions between communities and the police is the fact that police have a really difficult time in communities where they know guns are everywhere,  he said before using Dallas as an example because protesters participating in the rally that night exercised their right to open carry because Texas is an open-carry state. Because of all the guns around, the confused police initially had trouble figuring out who was shooting at them, even aiming their guns at the crowd before discovering where the shots were really coming from.With that said, President Obama challenged Republicans to put their money where their mouth is and treat guns as a contributing factor to gun violence if they really care about the lives of police as they claim: If you care about the safety of our police officers, then you can t set aside the gun issue and pretend that s irrelevant We can t just ignore that and pretend that that s somehow political or the president is just pushing his policy agenda. It s a contributing factor, not the sole factor, but a contributing factor to the broader tensions that arise between police and the communities where they serve There is a way to talk about that that is consistent with our Constitution and the Second Amendment. The problem is even mention of it somehow evokes this kind of polarization between a very intense minority and a majority of Americans who think we could do better when it comes to gun safety. Here s the video via Youtube.Conservatives want everyone to believe that there is a war between cops and black people, probably because they are hoping for one so the NRA and gun industry can make more money selling guns to every person they successfully scare with their bullshit. But the fact is that if the Dallas shooter had not had access to a high-powered assault rifle, there would be more police officers alive today. But Republicans refuse to do anything that would tighten gun restrictions in this country even though such restrictions could reduce gun violence and save lives, including the lives of police officers who have to work in these guns everywhere states wondering who is going to open fire next.Featured image via screenshot",News,"July 9, 2016"
14092,NATIONAL SECURITY ALERT! Obama Administration Giving Out Green Cards Like Candy To Migrants From Muslim Nations,"OUR GOVERNMENT IS GIVING OUT GREEN CARDS LIKE CANDY at double the rate to Muslims over everyone else. A green card is a path to American citizenship so this is very important. Besides the security risk, this is an attempt to change the nation forever. Look at Europe! The citizens of Europe are screaming to get their sovereignty back after basically being invaded by thousands and thousands of Muslims. This is a quiet invasion but is still very serious and wrong: National security has never appeared to be a priority for the Obama administration, but this is downright alarming as the U.S. encounters burgeoning threats from radical Islamists. With Islamic terrorism on the rise in the United States and Western Europe, it s worth mentioning that the Obama administration issued around 680,000 green cards to foreigners from Muslim countries during a five-year period, according to data published by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The stats, the latest made available by DHS, also show that the U.S. government admits more than double the number of immigrants from Muslim nations than from the European Union.This disturbing information was circulated by the Senate Judiciary Committee s subcommittee on Immigration, which assesses that if there s no change in the current policy, the U.S. will likely grant another 680,000 migrants possibly more from Muslim-majority countries green cards in the next five years. According to the DHS figures cited by the panel, Uncle Sam issued approximately 680,000 green cards to immigrants from 49 Muslim nations from fiscal year 2009 through fiscal year 2013. Over the same period, the U.S. issued only 270,000 green cards to migrants from the European Union, according to a committee announcement that reminds us  a green card entitles recipients to access federal benefits, lifetime residency, work authorization, and a direct route to becoming a U.S. citizen.  Some of the recipients are admitted to the U.S. as refugees so they immediately qualify for federal welfare benefits like food stamps and Medicaid.The DHS stats include a breakdown of the countries where the migrants came from. Pakistan and Iraq sent over the most with 83,000 apiece and Bangladesh had 75,000. Seventy-three thousand came from Iran, 45,000 from Egypt, 31,000 from Somalia, 24,000 from Uzbekistan, Turkey and Morocco had 22,000 each, Jordan and Albania 20,000 each and Lebanon and Yemen each had 16,000. Rounding out the five-digit club is Indonesia (15,000), Syria (14,000), Sudan (13,000), Afghanistan (11,000) and Sierra Leone (10,000). The rest, including Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Kosovo and Libya, only sent over a few thousand during the five-year period covered by the DHS data. By contrast, only 65,000 green cards were granted to migrants from the European Union country (United Kingdom) with the highest number during this period. The Senate committee reveals that DHS has not yet published statistics covering fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2015 so we ll be on the lookout for that.National security has never appeared to be a priority for the Obama administration, but this is downright alarming as the U.S. encounters burgeoning threats from radical Islamists.Read more: Judicial Watch",politics,"Apr 18, 2016"

From his abusive and unconstitutional  fake news  attacks to the clear ignoring of questions that the American people want to know the answers to.Ignoring questions and treating the press like dirt has seemingly also spread to the State Department, and on Tuesday morning, NBC s Andrea Mitchell alongside several others from the press were herded up and bullied out, all the while no questions were answered.Mitchell tried to get a few pressing answers from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. She asked: Can you respond to the threats from China? Can you be sure the Trump administration will be strong against Vladimir Putin? Can you assure us that Russia will not be able to move further in Ukraine? You can then see Mitchell grabbed by the arms and escorted out while saying: We haven t had any time in here. This all begs the question, why doesn t the Trump administration want to answer any questions?

8779, FL Crowd Says ‘Amen’ When ‘Christian’ Man Brags About Molesting Children And Getting Away With It (VIDEO),"Jacksonville, Florida police are investigating a man after he stood in front of the City Council and told them he spent most of his life molesting children and getting away with it.The comments came during a Tuesday night debate over Jacksonville s Human Rights Ordinance, which would further protect the LGBT community in the city. Roy Bay, 56, stood up during the public comment part of the council meeting and said: I lived most of my life sexually assaulting kids and never went to jail. Because why? Kids believed me that hey this is, you re alright son. This is not a problem. Okay? This happens in homosexual lifestyle. Bay claims that the reason he started molesting children was because he was  sexually assaulted by the homosexual community  from the age of ten to twelve.The WHOLE homosexual community? Really? WOW.He said that he  entered into the life of homosexuality  afterwards and that is when he started molesting kids. He then claimed that in 1995 he became a  born-again child of God  and  God set him free  from his lifestyle of raping innocent children. When he mentioned  God  some members of the crowd began to clap and say  amen. News4Jax reports that the sheriff s department was informed of Bay s criminal confession and they said that there will be an investigation into his alleged crimes. There is no statute of limitations for child molestation in the state of Florida if the victims are under the age of twelve. So, it is entirely possible that his LGBT-bashing confession might land him in prison.Bay s assertions that the gay community is filled with predators like himself is completely unfounded. UC Davis published a 1982 study by Dr. A. Nicholas Groth that found that children are not in greater danger of being molested by homosexuals than heterosexuals:Are homosexual adults in general sexually attracted to children and are preadolescent children at greater risk of molestation from homosexual adults than from heterosexual adults? There is no reason to believe so. The research to date all points to there being no significant relationship between a homosexual lifestyle and child molestation. There appears to be practically no reportage of sexual molestation of girls by lesbian adults, and the adult male who sexually molests young boys is not likely to be homosexual.This is because, contrary to what Bay says, rape is never about sexuality, it is about power. The desire to have complete control over somebody is what fuels rapists and if Bay is the predator he claims to be, that is likely the reason he was raping children. The crowd members who shouted  amen  and clapped are probably the same imbeciles who support known child molester Josh Duggar. People like Duggar and Bay hide behind their Bible and commit atrocious crimes all while pushing disgusting stereotypes about the LGBT community to hide their own crimes.Hopefully, the police will find some evidence about this guy s crimes and put him in prison where he belongs.Watch:Featured image via video screenshot ",News,"January 13, 2016"
15492,TOP DEMOCRAT ACTIVIST WHO LAUNCHED ONLINE CAMPAIGN TO THREATEN AND BULLY 12 YR OLD CONSERVATIVE Is Facing Charges [Video],"CJ Pearson, the 12 year old conservative social media sensation who was bullied and threatened by grown-ups on the left, has more class in his little finger than the entire Democrat party combined. Here is a video message to President Barack Obama by CJ Pearson regarding his hatred for America that has over 1 million hits:The woman who launched an online campaign of bullying and veiled threats against Internet sensation CJ Pearson, frightening the young conservative s family enough to drive the boy briefly out of politics late last week, has been identified as a  top Democratic activist  from Baltimore.And the Pearson family is planning to press charges.According to a Facebook posting Sunday by Ali A. Akbar of Vice and Victory, a consulting firm that works with CJ, the woman behind the Twitter account  Mona Hussein Obama  is actually named Mona Brown. What she did was against the law,  Akbar said on the video, vowing to  expose a troll, a bully, a grown adult and top Democrat activist in Maryland for bullying a 12-year-old. Late last week, Brown began her Twitter campaign of harassment against Pearson in retaliation for Internet videos harshly critical of Obama that have made the boy an Internet sensation. Her tweets ranged from insults    your fam has been bowing down to white ppl    to hints of violence  Wish we could switch Trayvon s life for yours. On Facebook Friday, the 12-year-old announced he had had enough. After much thought and consideration, I ve decided to take a break from politics and political commentary,  he wrote.  I had a horribly rough night on Twitter after a woman not only threatened to sue me for expressing my opinions but threatened my family. The boy handed over his social media accounts to Vice and Victory, which quickly set up a support fund and hashtag #StandWithCJ.CJ s Facebook page now includes an apology Brown sent after her true identity became known. I apologize and am deeply ashamed of the horrible statements I made to @cjpearson,  she wrote.She then goes on to complain about how  the right wing  is attacking her family   apparently missing the irony that she earlier attacked the Pearson family and wished for their death.Pearson plans to get back into politics and says that the incident has only made his resolve stronger. After much thought and consideration, I have decided to press forward and continue to fight for what I believe in,  he wrote on Facebook.  Mona s hate has only strengthened my resolve and has encouraged me to continue to do what I love and what I do best. Via: Biz Pac Review",politics,"Jul 9, 2015"

9279,JUST IN: SUPREME COURT Rules On Trump Travel Ban,"Another winner for America and for President Trump! The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the travel ban! Guess who voted against it Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor said they would have left the lower court orders in place. Is anyone surprised by the two lefty judges? Not us!Fox News reports:Handing the White House a huge judicial victory, the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday ruled in favor of President Trump s travel ban affecting residents of six majority-Muslim countries.The justices said the policy can take full effect despite multiple legal challenges against it that haven t yet made their way through the court system.The ban applies to people from Syria, Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.Lower courts had said people from those countries with a  bona fide  relationship with someone in the United States could not be prevented from entry.Grandparents and cousins were among the relatives courts said could not be excluded.The nine-member high court said in two one-page orders late Monday afternoon that lower court rulings that partly blocked the ban should be put on hold while appeals courts in Richmond, Va., and San Francisco take up the case.Liberal-leaning Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor said they would have left the lower court orders in place.Both courts are scheduled to hear arguments in those cases this week.Both courts are also dealing with the issue on an accelerated basis, and the Supreme Court noted it expects those courts to reach decisions  with appropriate dispatch. Quick resolution by appellate courts would allow the Supreme Court to hear and decide the issue this term, by the end of June.Trump s travel ban has been challenged in separate lawsuits by Hawaii and the American Civil Liberties Union. Both have argued the ban discriminates against Muslims and should not go into effect under immigration laws.",politics,"Dec 4, 2017"
2981," Trump STRANDED, In Full Panic As ANOTHER Performer Drops Out Of Inauguration (DETAILS)","President-elect Donald Trump has had trouble finding people to perform at his inauguration from the moment he won the election. While A-list artists have usually jumped at the opportunity to sing or play for a new President, celebrities have turned Trump down left and right. It s been a massive public embarrassment for Trump, even as his team uses bribery to get gigs and continues to fail.The humiliation is far from over. The VERY few acts that agreed to perform for Trump are now dwindling. The latest to pull out just days before Trump s big day is the B-Street Band, a Bruce Springsteen cover band. The cover band has just announced that, due to the backlash the group received since news broke that they would play for Trump, they are abandoning the gig.In an interview with Rolling Stone, Will Forte, the group s keyboardist, manager, agent and publicist, said that the band received  thousands of emails  that made the band reconsider. He recalled saying to his band members,  We re standing out in the storm right here. We gotta get out of the storm. Due to the fact that Springsteen himself had publicly condemned Trump many times before, the band thought it would only be right to honor him and the fans that had made the Springsteen cover band a reality. Forte said: We owe everything to [Bruce] and our gratitude and respect to the band is imperative above all else. We felt that we had to make it known that we didn t want to seem disrespectful, in any way, shape or form, to Bruce and his music and his band. I don t want to upset them. We owe everything to him and our gratitude and respect to the band is imperative above all else. It became clear to us that this wasn t working and we just had to do what we thought was the right thing to do and that was to pull out. TwitterThe B-Street Band had actually signed a contract in 2013 to play at this year s gig, but that was before the presidential nominees had been voted on. The band never thought they might have to play for Trump. Forte revealed: As time went by, the complexity of the situation became real immense and intense. The band was caught in a hurricane. We didn t see this coming, of course. When I started this band 37 years ago, it was only about performing and making people happy. I never thought the distortion of what we do as a band would ve been so intense. I wish it never would ve happened. We would ve never got involved in this if I knew how this would turn out. I would trade in all the support and publicity just to go back to where we were four months ago. I don t think they ll ever be a cover band of our size in the history of music that will get the attention of something this big. I m worn out. The band s worn out. Everybody loves to have their 15 minutes of fame, but maybe not this way. TwitterForte acknowledges that the the B-Street Band may now be punished financially for breaking the contract, but considers its stance more important. Forte said: So far, it s okay. But that s all I can say. Whatever the consequences are for breaking a contract, I m willing to take because this is much more important. Trump is literally about to be left stranded at his inauguration.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images",News,"January 16, 2017"
21156,BREAKING: Man Rushes To Paris Police Station Doors With Knife Screaming “Allahu Akbar”…Was He Another “Muslim Clock Boy?”,"It doesn t appear the man rushing to doors of a Paris police station with a knife, screaming  Allahu Akbar  wearing a fake suicide vest will garner a visit to France s President Francois Hollande s office. While France has made the decision to take a hard-line on Muslim terrorists, Obama and his Attorney General, Loretta Lynch have taken a hard-line against any American who uses language that they consider  hate speech  against Muslims. The idea that the  Muslim Clock Boy  (a term that we coined) was able to take a fake bomb to school and become an overnight celebrity, as our  victim of the month  in America tells us all we need to know about how seriously the Left has taken the threat of terrorism in America. Paris police shot dead on Thursday a man wielding a knife after he tried to enter a police station shouting  Allahu Akbar  (God is Great) and wearing what turned out to be a fake suicide belt.The incident took place exactly one year after deadly Islamist militant attacks on the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine in the French capital and also just minutes after President Francois Hollande had given a speech in an another part of Paris to mark the anniversary. The man may have been wearing something that could be a suicide belt,  Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet told BFM TV. Brandet later confirmed to Reuters that the suicide belt was fake.France has been on high alert ever since the shootings last January at the Charlie Hebdo office and at a Jewish supermarket in which 17 people died over three days.Security concerns were further heightened in November, when 130 people were killed in the capital in coordinated shootings and suicide bombings that targeted a music hall, bars and restaurants and a soccer stadium.Islamic State, the militant group that controls swathes of Iraq and Syria, claimed responsibility for the Nov. 13 attacks. Several of the militants involved in those attacks were, like last January s killers, French-born.In Thursday s incident, the man tried to force his way into the police station in the 18th district in northern Paris, an area that Islamic State said it had been planning to hit as part of the November attacks.WIRES PROTRUDING According to our colleagues, he wanted to blow himself up,  an official at the Alternative Police union said.  He shouted Allahu Akbar and had wires protruding from his clothes. That s why the police officer opened fire. Officials said bomb disposal experts were on site.Journalist Anna Polonyi, who could see the outside of the police station from the window of her flat, posted photos on social media that showed what appeared to be a bomb-disposal robot beside the body.She told Reuters that her sister, in the flat with her, had seen the incident happen. She said the police shouted at the man and that he then started running towards them before they shot him.Last year s attacks have boosted the popularity of the far-right National Front party ahead of a presidential election due in 2017.In his speech, Hollande promised to better equip police to prevent further militant attacks.The president also defended draconian security measures implemented since November that his Socialist government had once shunned.

I lost everything and I almost lost my life  -Monica Lewinsky, 2015Here is Monica Lewinsky, now a 41 year old woman who is actually being paid to address audiences about how her affair with then President Bill Clinton destroyed her life. What price did Bill Clinton pay for destroying this young girl s life? What price did Hillary pay for enabling his behavior (that bordered on pedophilia given the age difference between Bill and Monica)? This young girl was  slut shamed  by the entire world while Bill and Hillary, unconcerned with her well-being, huddled together to work out the details of how they would deceive the world with lies and save their political careers and ambitions. Hillary even went so far as to call Monica a  narcissistic looney tune. Does anyone really believe the audience at this event had any desire to hear what Monica Lewinsky had to say about the age of media, and how it affects people s lives? They wanted to hear about what it was like to have an affair with the former President of the United States of America, who also happens to be a serial philanderer, and is still married to a woman who pretends to be a champion for other women. The Clinton machine made sure Monica Lewinsky didn t receive any compassion from the media. She was made into a public joke, and humiliated by a rabid press who was looking for someone other than the Clinton s to blame for the shame that Bill Clinton brought to the office of President of The United States.The Clinton s never gave a damn about this young girl they only cared how about how they could spin it with the media, so as not to affect Hillary s Presidential ambitions ",politics,"Aug 8, 2016"
9931,Is Conservative Firebrand Laura Ingraham Joining Fox News?,"Will radio host and television commentator Laura Ingraham become a prime time host at Fox News? The word is that Ingraham will be taking the ten o clock spot.The rumor started when Matt Drudge of The Drudge Report hinted that Ingraham had a spot on Fox lined up.Ingraham has been telling friends that the deal is essentially done, with just a few details to iron out, CNN reports.Ingraham s taking over of ten o clock is part of a larger restructuring of Fox s lineup. Sean Hannity s show will move from its current ten o clock slot to nine p.m. And  The Five  will move back to five p.m. from its current nine o clock time.This shift was almost certainly prompted by the firing of Eric Bolling and concurrent cancelling of Bolling s panel show,  The Specialists,  which previously filled the five o clock slot. Bolling had been under internal investigation following accusations of sexual misconduct on his part, claims which Bolling fervently denies.Bolling s sudden exit is part of a larger shake-up at Fox prompted by allegations of sexual misconduct. Fox Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes left in July 2016, while Bill O Reilly left in April after 21 years at the network, both for similar reasons.It is not known when the show will begin airing, but CNN s sources say that the deal has been confirmed. A Fox News spokeswoman denied the existence of the deal to CNN.We certainly hope this is a done deal. Ingraham gets the Trump voter and isn t in the DC bubble.

5814, Watch Elizabeth Warren Clobber Trump And Scott Brown: ‘Celebrity Apprentice Meets Biggest Loser’,"Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren once again took aim at Donald Trump and took no prisoners as she hilariously mocked the possibility of a Trump ticket with her one-time rival Scott Brown as his running mate.Warren began her speech at the New Hampshire Democratic Convention on Saturday by apologizing to the state for beating Brown in her home state because she  never expected  him to become New Hampshire s problem. And from there, Warren proceeded to lampoon the idea of Brown as Trump s vice-presidential nominee. I hear that Donald Trump is floating Scott Brown as a possible running mate. And I thought,  Oh, so Donald Trump really does have a plan to help the unemployed.' The crowd erupted in laughter as Warren continued landing punches with more jokes. Scott Brown for vice-president makes a certain kind of sense. I mean that. I think of all the expert advice he can offer Donald Trump. Making up lies about me and my family. Saying weird stuff about his beautiful daughter. And let s face it, nobody knows more about losing to a girl than Scott Brown. Think of it as the perfect reality TV show: Celebrity Apprentice meets The Biggest Loser. Warren then set the jokes aside and took a more serious tone as she focused all of her fire on the Republican nominee. Every day we learn more about him, and every day it becomes clearer that he is just a small, insecure money-grubber who doesn t care about anyone or anything that doesn t have the Trump name splashed all over it. Every day it becomes clearer that he is a thin-skinned, racist, sexist bully. Every day it becomes clearer that he will never be president of the United States. Then she likened Trump s scam university to a used car dealership, but pointed out that the comparison isn t really  fair to used car dealerships. Here is a man who runs a business to profit off other people s pain,  she continued before slamming Trump for whining about the judge overseeing the lawsuit against him. Poor little Donald is shaking in his high-priced Italian loafers, begging the court to protect him,  she quipped.  Are you scared, Donald? You should be. Here s the full speech via YouTube:Donald Trump just got his ass handed to him by Elizabeth Warren. And if he really is thinking about picking Scott Brown as his running mate he should probably think again since it s clear such a pairing would be lampooned in the same way for months leading up to the election in November. And that s not a good thing for the GOP. It would be a disaster. Just like it would be a disaster for this nation if Trump somehow wins the election.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"June 19, 2016"
23293,"PAY 2 PLAY: Democratic Convention Ends Amid Controversy, Empty Seats & White Noise","Shawn Helton 21st Century WireThe 2016 Democratic National Convention was the latest in a long line of sordid political productions  It was a tough week for the Clinton  change makers  as Bernie Sanders delegates staged a mass walkout after a series of email leaks disclosed that a Clinton lawyer gave the DNC strategy advice on how to sideline the Sanders campaign.There were also claims of white noise machines used to quell any anti-Clinton dissent inside the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia. Help Wanted: Actors Needed Putting aside the fact that today s US presidential conventions have turned into celebrity show business promotional events (pop star Katie Perry, Ted Danson, and even British actor Orlando Bloom et all), there s another more disturbing controversy emerging   this time over a Craigslist ad stating that,  actors were needed for a national convention    prompting critics to suggest empty seats had to be filled prior to the end of the convention and that the July 27th ad was at the behest of the DNC.Whether or not all or some of the claims above are fully accurate, 2016 s DNC was unquestionably a contentious affair filled with a heavy dose of identity politics.In fact, the star-studded event conjured the bizarre Orlando Pulse nightclub shooting from just over a month ago by having Christine Leinonen speak at the convention, a former Michigan State Police trooper/Florida Attorney turned Wheel of Fortune hopeful, and mother of Christopher (Drew) Leinonen, an apparent victim of America s largest mass shooting. Here s Australia s Peekay Truth on YouTube examining the phenomena surrounding Christine Leinonen Interestingly, Chris Leinonen s pro gun father Mark Bando, a former patrol officer for the city of Detroit PD from 1974-99, did not speak at the convention on behalf of his son.Additionally at Leinonen s speech at the DNC, she was accompanied by Pulse nightclub shooting survivor Brandon Wolf, who just happens to be a former runner-up on Bravo TV s The Kandi Factory. We ve noted before, the many strange Hollywood links to the Pulse shooting, including the apparent actor-cum-shooter Omar Mateen.Below is a YouTube video from the user Run2Christ HD, which investigates the many casting connections linked to Brandon Wolf, while also disclosing that one of the Pulse nightclub founders, Ron Legler, is the president of the Florida Theatrical Association and a booking agent for national touring broadway productions. Some of FTA s productions include The Lion King, Chicago and The Phantom of the Opera.Here s Brandon Wolf ready for his close-up Here s a screen shot of Ron Legler s professional background Here at 21WIRE, we examined much of the anomalies associated with the Orlando shooting, an event that failed to account for any shootings said to have taken place within the nightclub, as the FBI s own transcript made no mention of individuals being shot inside the club.If you remember, according to FOX analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano plainly states that all of the Pulse nightclub victims met their fate when Orlando police entered the building Here s a You Tube video montage from Educate Yourself, that displays some of the strange behaviour exhibited by Christine Leinonen More DNC discussion from Zero Hedge below DNC NIGHTMARE?    Empty seats observed during roll call at the DNC. (Image Source: fellowshipofminds)Zero HedgeDid The DNC Hire Actors (At Below Minimum Wage) To Work At The Convention?Following the exposure of a fake Trump job advertisement designed by The DNC to embarrass Trump, it is interesting that a Craigslist ad calling for  Actors Needed for National Convention  has surfaced Whether the ad is real or fake is unclear, but the text suggests below minimum wage compensation (7-plus hours work for $50) and the number of walkouts from the Convention indicates perhaps a need for cheering happy seat-fillers SNOOZEFEST    Bill Clinton nods off during Hillary s vacuous speech. (Image Source: YouTube)Actors Needed For National Convention (Philadelphia) compensation: $50.00 Looking for 700 people to be utilized as actors during the National Convention. We currently have a number of empty seats that will need to be filled as we are currently removing a number of people and need to refill their seats for the remainder of the conference. You will be paid $50.00 each night for the remainder of the convention. You will be required to cheer at all times and will be asked to dress properly and possibly wear some promotional material.Which makes sense if one looks at the following shocking video from film director, Josh Fox, best known for his Oscar-nominated anti-fracking documentary Gasland, captured inside the DNC As DailyWire.com reports, Fox tells the camera   This is amazing, this place is empty. There is nobody left in here. I mean this whole stadium, look at this,  as he pans his cellphone to show the lack of cheering Dems.He continues in disbelief, adding,  This is not voter enthusiasm . I can t believe my eyes. I ve never seen anything like this. This is the primetime of the Democratic National Convention right after the nomination of Hillary Clinton and this place is emptied out like crazy. I m stunned. This is insane.

8206, Sanders Fans Break Fundraising Site After NH Primary Win (VIDEO/TWEETS),"After Bernie Sanders  win in New Hampshire on Tuesday night, so many people contributed to his campaign that ActBlue, the fundraising service used by Democratic candidates, is having trouble processing the donations. That s because during his victory speech, Sanders said: I m not going to New York City to host a fundraiser on Wall Street. Instead, I m going to hold a fundraiser right here, right now, across America. My request is please go to BernieSanders.com and contribute. So there it is, that s our fundraiser. Pretty quick,  Sanders concluded. That  fundraiser  brought in more than $5.1 million dollars in one night for Sanders.  It was a Yuuuge night for the Democratic candidate.Here is the victory speech that broke the internet:Sanders supporters took to Twitter to complain that their contributions were not going through. Act Blue is doing the best they can to deal with the new flood of donations being sent to Sanders.Huge night! Contributions are processing, receipts are a little delayed. Keep the donations coming!!

ActBlue (@actblue) February 10, 2016 ActBlue laid out what happened to cause the issues, in a blog post: Last night s spontaneous fundraiser (the one that raised $5.2 million in less than a day) broke our external processor s response systems. That s some amazing grassroots power. Like we said, we over-prepare, so we were ready for that. But the vendor started giving us a previously undocumented error message, which temporarily caused some donors to not move from the  please wait  page to the confirmation page even though their contributions were already fully processed As a certain hilarious SNL skit pointed out, we all know that Bernie Sanders  average campaign donation is $27 dollars. The people-powered campaign has already smashed President Obama s previous record for the highest number of contributions. The fact that people are making smaller donations to Sanders  campaign gives the candidate a huge advantage in terms of grassroots fundraising. Since very few people have donated the maximum amount they can, supporters can continue to donate to Sanders  campaign throughout the primary season.That might have something to do with why Sanders  raised more money than Hillary Clinton s campaign in January. In January, Sanders received $20 million dollars in donations, while Clinton raised $15 million dollars.Rest assured, anxious Berners.  The campaign s site is up and running and this shouldn t be a problem anymore.

22102,ABSOLUTE SUBMISSION: Trump Bows to Neocon Orthodoxy,"Consortium News Exclusive: In his Mideast trip to Saudi Arabia and Israel, President Trump sought some political safe harbor by tacking toward neocon orthodoxy and jettisoning his campaign promises of a more rational strategy, writes Daniel Lazare.Daniel Lazare Consortium NewsWith astounding precision, Donald Trump zeroed in on the worst possible Middle East policy option in his recent trip to Saudi Arabia and made it his own. He rebuffed the efforts of Iran s newly elected moderate government to open up communications with the West and instead deepened America s alliances with decrepit autocratic regimes across the Persian Gulf.Turning up his nose at Iran   a rising young power   he embraced Saudi Arabia, which is plainly on its last legs. It was a remarkable display    rather like visiting a butcher shop and passing up a fresh steak for one that s rancid and smelly and buzzing with flies.Saudi Arabia is not just any tired dictatorship with an abysmal human-rights record but one of the most spectacularly dysfunctional societies in history. It takes in half a billion dollars a day in oil revenue, yet is so profligate that it could run out of money in half a decade. It sits atop 18 percent of the world s proven oil reserves, yet is so wasteful that, at current rates, it will become a net importer by the year 2030.Its king travels with a thousand-person retinue wherever he goes while his son, Deputy Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman, plunked down $550 million not long ago when a 440-foot yacht caught his eye in the south of France. Yet this pair of royal kleptocrats dares preach austerity at a time when as much as 25 percent of the population lives on less than $17 a day in trash-strewn Third World slums.Similarly, Saudi Arabia s appetite for high-tech weaponry is such that in 2015 it became the largest arms importer in the world. Yet its military is so inept that it is unable to subdue ragtag Houthi rebels in neighboring Yemen or even stop them from raiding deep inside Saudi territory and launching regular missile attacks.The kingdom accuses Iran of sectarianism yet bans all religions other than Islam, arrests Christians for the  crime  of praying and possessing Bibles, equates atheism with terrorism, and has imposed a state of siege on Shi ite Muslims in its own Eastern Province. Although a bit restrained of late, its religious police are notorious for roaming the shopping malls and striking out with canes at anyone violating shari a law.As the English novelist Hilary Mantel (of Wolf Hall fame) recalled of the four years she spent in the kingdom with her geologist husband, it was impossible to know what might arouse their ire:  it might be the flashing denim legs of a Filipina girl revealed for a second beneath an abaya gone adrift, or it might be the plate-glass shop front of a business that, as the evening prayer call spiraled through the damp air-conditioned halls, had failed to slam down its metal shutters fast enough. What were the rules? No one knew. Saudi Arabia also denounces terrorism at every turn even though its funding groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS (also known as ISIL and Islamic State) is an open secret. In 2009, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton complained in a diplomatic memo made public by Wikileaks that  donors in Saudi Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni terrorist groups worldwide.  In September 2014, she observed that  Qatar and Saudi Arabia   are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region. A few days later, Vice President Joe Biden told a Harvard audience that  the Saudis, the emirates, etc.   were so determined to take down [Syrian President Bashar al-] Assad and essentially have a proxy Sunni-Shia war   [that] they poured hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of tons of military weapons into anyone who would fight against Assad, except the people who were being supplied were Al Nusra and Al Qaeda and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world.  (Quote starts at 53:30.)Arming the SaudisRather than fighting ISIS and Al Qaeda, the Saudis give them money so that they can wage jihad on religious minorities. Yet this is the country that Trump now calls upon to  drive out the terrorists and extremists,  which is as ludicrous as relying on the KKK to drive out racism. It s also the country that he hopes will serve as the cornerstone of an  Arab NATO  so that he can sell it more jet fighters and Blackhawk helicopters.But the Saudi military is already top-heavy with such gear while at the same time so short of infantry that it relies on ill-trained Sudanese mercenaries, scores of whom were reportedly killed in a recent battle in the Red Sea province of Midi in Yemen s north. This is not surprising since no Saudi in his right mind wants to serve as a foot soldier so that the deputy crown prince can buy another yacht. But more such purchases will only add to the military imbalance while adding more fuel to the broader Middle East conflagration.So how did this god-awful marriage come about? Is it all Trump s fault? Or have others contributed to the mess? The answer, of course, is the latter.Every president since Franklin Roosevelt has contributed to the catastrophe. Roosevelt declared Saudi Arabia a U.S. protectorate while Dwight Eisenhower got it into his head that a corrupt desert monarchy would somehow be useful in the fight against Communism. Worried that it might come under Soviet influence, Jimmy Carter commenced a military buildup in the Persian Gulf that, according to a 2009 Princeton University study, has now surpassed the $10-trillion mark.Ronald Reagan relied on the Saudis to finance arms to the Nicaraguan Contras and to Jonas Savimbi s pro-apartheid guerrillas in Angola. George H.W. Bush launched a major war to save the Saudis from the evil Saddam Hussein. George W. Bush and Barack Obama covered up the Saudi role in 9/11, while Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton encouraged them and other Gulf monarchies to fund anti-government rebels in Libya and Syria during the Arab Spring. Both Libya and Syria fell to ruin as a consequence as hundreds of millions of dollars flowed to pro-Al Qaeda forces and the flames of Wahhabist terrorism spread ever wider.Indeed, Donald Trump for a while seemed to augur something different. Rather than praising the kingdom, he denounced it in 2011 as  the world s biggest funder of terrorism  and asserted, not inaccurately, that it was using  our petro dollars   our very own money   to fund the terrorists that seek to destroy our people while the Saudis rely on us to protect them.

5975, Iowa Legislator Leaves Republican Party Over Trump’s Racism,"For almost an entire year Donald Trump insulted, berated, bastardized and scrutinized everything that wasn t a white, Christian male. Republicans barely flinched.Then he makes a comment about a Mexican judge s heritage when it pertains to his fraud lawsuit. Republicans lose their minds (and rightfully so).It appears that Trump s comments about Judge Gonzalo Curiel has hit a special nerve in one state legislator.The Des Moines Register has broken the news that David Johnson, who has served in the Iowa General Assembly for 18 years as a Republican, will be leaving the GOP over the party s  bigot  nominee, Donald J. Trump.Johnson told the Register: I will not stand silent if the party of Lincoln and the end of slavery buckles under the racial bias of a bigot. The now former Republican will be registering as a member of  no party preference,  and said he will never support Hillary Clinton for president. However, Johnson has also stated that he is not sure he will caucus with the Republicans in the Legislature, feeling that members of the GOP have become  too timid  to take on Trump and his supporters. Johnson did say that if a formidable Republican steps up to the plate and challenged Trump nationally, he may rejoin the party, but said: If Mr. Trump is the nominee, he becomes the standard bearer for a party that s on the verge of breaking apart. He simply cannot unify the GOP. If there is a profound split, I ll gladly rejoin Republicans who are dedicated to equality and justice for all, and let Trump lead his supporters over the cliff. And that s exactly what Mr. Trump will do. Johnson also knows how this will hurt him politically, but says he doesn t care, citing his record of often going against the Republican establishment in the state when it comes to education funding and Medicaid program.One thing is for sure   we will see many more Republicans follow Johnson s lead in he coming months.Featured image via Elijah Nouvelage/Getty Images",News,"June 7, 2016"
14331,IF HILLARY AND BERNIE Are Counting On The Cuban Vote…They’re Making A BIG Mistake…Here’s Why…,"The Cuban vote is a conservative vote so Hillary and Bernie might want to steer clear.Every election cycle, media outlets beg the question of whether Miami s Little Havana will finally sway Democrat. After spending an afternoon in south Florida s most famous Cuban neighborhood, the prospect once again seems unlikely.Ahead of Florida s primary, Little Havana s Cuban-Americans are enthusiastic about a local figure with similar life experience in Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla). But they still hold the value of a GOP nominee over any individual candidate.Brenda Betancourt, a notary public at the Calle Ocho Chamber of Commerce who paints on t-shirts and canvases in her spare time, told Independent Journal Review she voted early for Rubio, saying,  we prefer somebody that we know than a stranger. She added that she has never once cast a vote for a Democrat because the party s platforms are counterintuitive to the American experience: I will not vote for either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. I don t think that giving everything away without the person working is in the American dream. I think everybody has to work and earn what they need.  Read more: injo ",politics,"Mar 10, 2016"
17080,BOEHNER ANNOUNCES HIS FINAL ACT OF COWARDICE As He Steps Down Before Being Ousted As Speaker,"In his final act of putting Americans dead last, John Boehner will stand with Democrats in their rabid desire to keep the abortion industry humming. Because government funding for baby part harvesting businesses is exactly where American taxpayers want to see their hard earned money being spent. Well done John .U.S. House Speaker John Boehner vowed on Sunday that Congress will avoid a government shutdown this week and he would push through as much unfinished legislation as possible before leaving at the end of October.Speaking on CBS  Face the Nation two days after his surprise resignation, he said the House this week would pass a government funding bill now moving through the Senate, which does not meet conservatives  demands to cut off money for Planned Parenthood.Asked if passage would require Democratic votes, he responded:  I m sure it will, but I suspect my Democratic colleagues want to keep the government open as much as I do. Boehner resigned amid deep divisions among House Republicans over a range of issues including the handling of a Sept. 30 deadline to approve new funding for federal agencies and programs from education to national parks.Conservative Republicans, some of whom have called for his ouster, have insisted on punishing Planned Parenthood by withholding funds over allegations that the non-profit group improperly sold tissues harvested from aborted fetuses.But Boehner and more moderate Republicans have argued that such a move would not halt the bulk of the group s $500 billion in funding, which comes from reimbursements through the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor.

19770,"CATHOLICS SHOULD BE Singing Donald Trump’s Praises After He Boldly Defended Life, While Hillary Was Forced To Admit Support For Barbaric Partial-Birth Abortion","Rush Limbaugh was cheering for Trump and how he handled the abortion question that was asked in last night s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump. Do Catholics and other pro-life groups truly understand the significance of this election? Do they know how many Supreme Court Justices our next President will likely replace in the next 4 years? In addition to the abortion issue, our religious freedoms are at serious risk. The Left has been attacking Christianity and Judaism for years, while protecting the Muslim faith like their lives depend on it. Rush mentioned on his radio show today how shocked he was by Trump s unabashed support for the life of the unborn. He said that there has never been a presidential candidate in history who has so bravely stood up for life during a debate with the Democrat opponent, like Donald J. Trump did last night. Here is his brilliant analysis Rush: Let me ask you a question. When Chris Wallace asked this abortion question, did you people start cringing?  Oh, no, jeez, every time this comes up we get smoked, oh, my God.  And he turned it to partial-birth abortion on a dime, which was either brilliant or instinctive or combination of the two, because she had no defense for what he was alleging, and she didn t even try. Her only defense, when he brought up,  They want rip babies out of the womb a day before they re born, a week before they re born. And she doesn t deny it. All she can say is,  I have seen these women. I have met these women, and I m telling you it is one of the hardest things, I m telling you it is one of the most difficult things.  She s therefore on record as supporting partial-birth abortion last night. I will guarantee you that s the last thing anybody on the Democrat Party side ever factored would happen. That s why she wasn t prepared for it.And it was, I don t know, as I say, either brilliant or instinctive or a combination of the two, but to take that question on abortion, which has traditionally been a nail in the coffin for a Republican candidate, turn that around to a winning issue for him, a losing issue for her, and you ll note that nobody in the Drive-Bys is talking about that exchange. They don t want to go anywhere near it.And then she lied about Planned Parenthood and all these mammograms they do and all these precancer checks. They don t do a single mammogram, folks. They do not do them. They don t do checks for cancer. Their solution to everything at Planned Parenthood is an abortion. She lied through her teeth. I don t know if Trump knows that or not. Most people who,  Oh, great work, mammograms, care for women.  They don t do anything of the sort. They harvest baby parts and sell them! We now know that.But the partial-birth abortion thing, he turned it around on her. She didn t have a denial and the Drive-Bys aren t talking about it, and it s things like that in a debate you ll never hear any public reaction, no polling on it, but could have a huge impact. We ll never know. We won t know until the elections.   Via: Rushlimbaugh.com",left-news,"Oct 20, 2016"

When asked why he supports Trump, Baio, who identifies as a conservative independent, said Trump  communicates with people very well. https://youtu.be/Yxv7rEnf-a0 It s very simple, because when he speaks I understand him,  Baio said.  He speaks like I speak, he communicates with people very well. I want him, as any one person can do, to go into Washington and blow it up.

I m trying to be a classy guy, but to win elections nowadays, the Democrats and liberals attack viciously. Baio also slammed the Republican party, telling Pirro that it  lie and conned and B.S.ed  him.

7655," Shortly Before Her Death, Nancy Reagan Said She Was Ashamed Of The GOP (VIDEO)","On Sunday, the nation learned that former first lady Nancy Reagan, 94, had passed away at her Los Angeles home from congestive heart failure. Nancy was the wife of Republican hero Ronald Reagan and after his death in 2004, she became an outspoken activist for a cure Alzheimer s disease and huge beacon of support for families whose loved ones suffered from the degenerative illness. While Republican presidential candidates have expressed grief over her passing, her longtime friend, Larry King, said he is relieved that she will not be here to see the end of the GOP s disgusting presidential race.During an interview with CNN s Wolf Blitzer, King said: I ll miss her. I love socializing with her, I love gossiping with her, I love talking with her. If there s one thing glad about this,  he added.  She isn t around to see the end of this political year. Because she was very upset by it. We can understand why she would be upset. The candidates running for the Republican nomination have constantly tried to equate themselves with her husband. Even though a number of his children have spoken out and said that Reagan would be appalled by the comparisons.While these candidates, like Ted Cruz and (shudder) Donald Trump, name drop the former president during every GOP debate, they behave like schoolyard bullies and pledge to never compromise with Democrats. Reagan may have had faults (A LOT of them) but he knew how to compromise and he never, ever behaved the way the current Republican Party does.As a matter of fact, if Ronald Reagan was a candidate in this race, the others running would probably call him a RINO and a traitor. And they damn sure wouldn t support any amnesty plan for undocumented immigrants (like the one he is well-known for).The current GOP is so gross that when news of Nancy s passing spread, their voters took it as on opportunity to attack the current first lady, Michelle Obama.With all of this, is it really any wonder she was upset?Watch:https://youtu.be/TZUVIbWbT2w Featured image via video screenshot",News,"March 6, 2016"
5525, Man Who Pulled Glock On Portland Protesters Was Armed With Five Magazines Of Ammo (VIDEO),"Michael Strickland, 36, was arrested after pulling a handgun on Black Lives Matter protesters in Portland, Oregon, Thursday night. Video of the incident shows Strickland pulling what appears to be a Glock 26 on protesters who were demonstrating against the recent fatal shootings of black men by police officers. It was revealed that the gun owner had a round in the chamber and five other magazines of ammunition of him while aiming the gun at the anti-police brutality group, according to court records.Strickland is accused of two counts of unlawful use of a firearm, menacing and second- degree disorderly conduct, according to The Oregonian.Multnomah County deputy district attorney Kate Molina Friday successfully argued for Strickland s bail to be set at $250,000 after two felony counts of unlawful use of a firearm were added to misdemeanor allegations of menacing and second-degree disorderly conduct.Strickland had an extended clip in his firearm that he swept at chest level multiple times in front of the demonstrators. The gun owner also waved it in front of a plain-clothed Portland police officer.Portland Officer Branden L. Combs was in Chapman Square during the protest and heard people running by him yelling,  Gun! Gun!  and  He s got a gun,  according to a probable cause affidavit.Police were told by one of the protesters that Strickland has tried to  incite or instigate others  at different demonstrations.Officer Combs witnessed the incident. He was standing just about 20 to 25 yards away from Strickland when he went all Second Amendment on the protestestors, sweeping the crowd with his firearm.After the arrest, police found an extended clip in Strickland s handgun, a round in the chamber of the gun, plus two magazines of ammunition in a belt pouch, two magazines in one of his pants pockets and one magazine in the other, Molina said. In addition, he also had a pocket knife in his right front pants pocket.According to Strickland s attorney Chris Trotter, his client was a journalist who has a concealed carry permit, adding that he  has every right to protect himself.  Trotter alleged that the District Attorney s office was  making an example  of Strickland.Molina responded, saying that  Given that Mr. Strickland pulled a gun on a crowd of people in front of the steps of the Justice Center  and has a past police report alleging  possibly race-based threats  against an attendee at a Portland vigil for the victims of last month s Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida, his client s bail set at $250,000 is justified.From the video, it looks like Strickland aimed his Glock at a man who is armed with only a camera.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvV3BQ-RoJw]In a separate incident, a white male showed up at a memorial for Alton Sterling, the black Louisiana man who was fatally shot by police officers.Hey guys, you re doing the Second Amendment wrong.Image via screen capture.

1642, Golf Addicted 70-Year-Old Man Says He ‘Couldn’t Care Less About Golf’,"Just as drug addicts and alcoholics tend to be in denial of their disease, former reality show star Donald Trump does not think he has a problem. The alleged president has not addressed opioid addiction which is sweeping across the U.S., and that s probably because he, too, suffers from a type of addiction and remains in denial. Donald Trump needs treatment, but that would mean he d have to take a leave of absence from his job.The amateur president has spent 31 days of his time in office visiting at least one of his properties, including 19 visits to his golf clubs. He s been on the job for only 100 days. In contrast, former President Barack Obama only hit the golf course once during the same amount of time in office. Obama s first golf game was on April 26th, 2009.Still yet, as addicts do, Trump defended his frequent weekend trips to his luxury resort and properties, saying he does not care about golfing as much as people might think he does, according to The Hill. I have a lot of property. So if I go to my clubs like in New Jersey, they ll say,  Oh he is going to play golf.  I am not going to play golf,  Trump said in an interview on Fox News.  I couldn t care less about golf. Well, he sure did care when Obama played golf, though. In fact, there are dozens of rage-tweets from Trump about Obama playing golf.Can you believe that,with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf.Worse than Carter  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2014 But I have a place there that costs almost nothing because its hundreds of acres and security and they don t have to close up streets,  Trump added.What Trump means is that it costs him  nothing.  We, the taxpayers, though, are paying big time. It costs us about $3 million a pop every time he visits his Mar-a-Lago resort. Meanwhile, every visit to a Trump-owned property promotes it and that means there s a conflict of interest as he profits from the presidency.Trump did say that he feels  a little guilty  going back to his Trump Tower residence in New York because of all the expenses that are associated with each trip. But, he didn t mention the costs to taxpayers having to foot the bill for having several White Houses, instead of one. For example, the security for Melania Trump in New York reportedly costs the city s Police Department between $127,000 and $146,000 a day to protect her and her son. The Secret Service had to request an additional $60 million in funding to protect Trump and his family. I love New York, but going back is very expensive for the country because they close up Fifth Avenue and they close up 56th Street   and I always feel a little bit guilty when I go there,  he said.Trump said he does not want to be perceived as  lazy  but noted that he prefers to visit his other properties because they are not as expensive to secure. They are expensive to secure. Trump s frequent visits to his Florida resort have been a financial burden on the county. It would be much better if people would understand that I could go other places that I have,  Trump said.  But then they hit me for relaxing. And I don t want to be known as a person that relaxes because I am working hard and I am working hard for the people. Addiction, whether it be from drugs, alcohol, sex or golfing, is not a prejudiced disease. It can affect you whether you are black, white, Orange, rich or poor, pay your taxes, or if you try to hide your taxes from the public because you pay nothing at all.Photo by Ian MacNicol/Getty Images.",News,"April 29, 2017"

Yes, it seems the left didn t hear the president the first time around. They needed their own special speech but they ll still find something to complain about. Allowing Trump to be a good guy just doesn t fit their narrative. No matter how beautiful the speech was today, the Democrats will continue the rhetoric against Trump The last thing they want is a united America THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. I m in Washington today to meet with my economic team about trade policy and major tax cuts and reform. We are renegotiating trade deals and making them good for the American worker. And it s about time.Our economy is now strong. The stock market continues to hit record highs, unemployment is at a 16-year low, and businesses are more optimistic than ever before. Companies are moving back to the United States and bringing many thousands of jobs with them. We have already created over one million jobs since I took office.We will be discussing economic issues in greater detail later this afternoon, but, based on the events that took place over the weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia, I would like to provide the nation with an update on the ongoing federal response to the horrific attack and violence that was witnessed by everyone.I just met with FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation into the deadly car attack that killed one innocent American and wounded 20 others. To anyone who acted criminally in this weekend s racist violence, you will be held fully accountable. Justice will be delivered.As I said on Saturday, we condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence. It has no place in America.And as I have said many times before: No matter the color of our skin, we all live under the same laws, we all salute the same great flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God. We must love each other, show affection for each other, and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry, and violence. We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans.Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.We are a nation founded on the truth that all of us are created equal. We are equal in the eyes of our Creator. We are equal under the law. And we are equal under our Constitution. Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America.Two days ago, a young American woman, Heather Heyer, was tragically killed. Her death fills us with grief, and we send her family our thoughts, our prayers, and our love.We also mourn the two Virginia state troopers who died in service to their community, their commonwealth, and their country. Troopers Jay Cullen and Burke Bates exemplify the very best of America, and our hearts go out to their families, their friends, and every member of American law enforcement.These three fallen Americans embody the goodness and decency of our nation. In times such as these, America has always shown its true character: responding to hate with love, division with unity, and violence with an unwavering resolve for justice.As a candidate, I promised to restore law and order to our country, and our federal law enforcement agencies are following through on that pledge. We will spare no resource in fighting so that every American child can grow up free from violence and fear. We will defend and protect the sacred rights of all Americans, and we will work together so that every citizen in this blessed land is free to follow their dreams in their hearts, and to express the love and joy in their souls.Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America. Thank you very much.",politics,"Aug 14, 2017"
9041," Tired Of Things Going Well, Marco Rubio Makes Promise To Destroy America Again (VIDEO)","Listening to several of the Republican candidates for president, one could wonder if they ve been in a cryogenic sleep for the past seven years, and they re still talking about how badly George W. Bush screwed things up. However, no, they keep repeating the lie that the nation is so much worse now than it was at the brink of a recession before President Obama took over. Republican voters should honestly be insulted by this, being treated like idiots absent from reality. Although, maybe they are idiots absent to reality, and these Republican candidates are just being opportunistic.Repeating this lie of  seven disastrous years  of Obama, Marco Rubio took to the media branch of the GOP, Fox News, to give a quick campaign message and offer his well wishes for the new year. Hi, this is Marco Rubio, a senator from Florida, and a candidate for President of the United States. As we leave 2015 behind and look forward to 2016, with the elections that are coming up in November, this is the year where we re going to have a chance to turn America around. After seven disastrous years of the current president, we have a chance to reclaim the American dream, and that s why I m running for president. And my resolution for 2016 is to do everything I can to not just restore the American dream, but to expand it to reach more people and change more lives than ever before. So that this, the greatest country in the world, can be greater than it s ever been. So, what America does Rubio want to go back to, exactly? One where people are losing their homes? One where jobs are lost at a rate of 750,000 per month? One where people could be denied healthcare for a preexisting condition? One where the 14th amendment is ignored and marriage equality doesn t exist? One where Osama bin Laden is still alive? One where credit card companies can still screw customers over left and right?Honestly, what does Rubio want to do to  turn America around,  because it sure as hell looks as though we are headed in the right direction, and if anything could stand a candidate to continue Obama s progress and advance it further.Rubio apparently wants an America where Wall Street runs the show, people die or go bankrupt from lack of health coverage, and Americans aren t treated equally under the law. So, if that s the America Rubio wants   thanks, but no thanks. .@marcorubio:  This is the year where we re going to have a chance to turn America around.  #FoxNews2016 https://t.co/yvze0WpCKg  Fox News (@FoxNews) January 1, 2016 Video/Featured image: Twitter",News,"January 1, 2016"

22552,HEAD GAMES: Technology With The Potential To Shape Reality,"Randy Johnson 21st Century Wire  MIRROR MIRROR   Am I still just a movie concept?  Virtual  avatar  technology is in its infancy   as far as we know (Image: Actor Sam Worthington from the science fiction blockbuster film, Avatar).Is humanity s recent quantum leap with technology all fun and games, or a zombie-like march into the arms of a technocratic prison world?For generations we have seen global figures such as John F. Kennedy or Ronald Reagan speak on television and that s what we believed we have seen and heard.We have all heard, people say things such as  The President said it   it was on the news  or  she said it on TV, I saw it.  Ever since the invention of the medium of television, this has served as a sufficient casual reference to any event away from the local area.What if the words and image of a global figure, broadcast to millions on television, was not real?  What if your eyes and ears where literally deceiving you?Simply put, what if seeing isn t believing anymore?  What if the person on screen, on LIVE television, who is actually interacting with questions asked, was not the person being represented on screen?With technological advancements, as exemplified with the  still-in-development Face2Face system, the potential to present and act any person to an audience for multiple reasons, both good and bad, is here.  With respect to black budgets, exotic technology, and unknown classified advancements of similar computer systems and programs   technology beyond that of the Face2Face system could already be here and further advanced.What exactly is a Face2Face system?  TechCrunch.com describes it as taking,  A YouTube video of someone speaking like, say, George W. Bush.  Use a standard RGB [Red Green Blue] webcam to capture a video of someone else emoting and saying something entirely different.  Throw both videos into the Face2Face system and  you ve now got a relatively believable video of George W. Bush s face   now almost entirely synthesized   doing whatever the actor in the second video wanted the target s face to do. If the definition eludes you, then take a look at the Face2Face system in action.Watch below as life-like avatars of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Vladimir Putin follow visual commands in real time via the Face2Face system. That s great.  What about the voice you might ask?It does not take a wild imagination to envision voice software programs linked up with visual avatars for something like the Face2Face system in real time.Celebrity  voice changer  technology or other  voice morphing  software is already available at the consumer level.  Many security systems, phones, and buildings grant access by authenticating a person s voice.  There is even a real danger for people to have their actual voice  hacked  as they leave samples of it everywhere throughout the day.If the Face2Face technology, in a development stage as seen above, as does voice changing and voice recognition technology exists, then it only follows that the audio and the visual technology are destined to sync up.Just think of the implications.You could potentially have John Wayne, Elvis, Michael Jordan, Osama bin Laden, Miley Cyrus, or Justin Beiber wishing you happy birthday on a video message and interacting with you   Live.  It isn t really them, but then again it is them, just in a virtual reality sort of way.  Could there eventually be monetary charges to use the likeness of famous people dead or alive with certain companies owning certain celebrity s long dead and families of recent celebrities getting a cut?Perhaps a world leader could be dead for weeks and still delivering speeches or issuing orders. Anyone can be misquoted intentionally and questioned, framed, or made to fall from grace in the court of public opinion.  If you could take over another nation s airwaves, their leader can be seen saying something they said on television   except for the fact it isn t them and they never said it. Wars have been started for less.In the summer of 2015, 21WIRE discussed the use of a 3D avatar in the political realm, as India s Prime Minister Narendra Mohdi delivered a holographic speech at some 900 different rallies over the course of his campaign: Some would argue politicians are actors or entertainers in their own right, but hologram use is not limited to entertainers. Narendra Mohdi has already used the technology during his successful campaign to become India s Prime Minister. What would the future of electioneering look like with this new high-tech gadgetry?It has long been known that US political strategists have shaped elections throughout the world.In 2015, Hollywood released a fictionalized political comedy-drama named after a documentary called Our Brand Is Crisis (2005), a picture which gave a behind-the-scenes account of how James Carville and the political consultancy Greenberg Carville Shrum (GCS) socially-engineered the 2002 Bolivian elections to help Gonzalo S nchez de Lozada win the heavily contested presidency. He eventually resigned due to the so-called  Gas Wars,  where it was announced that he would follow pro-US economic policies and export natural gas to the US and Mexico.The documentary displays much of the socially-engineered electioneering that has been ongoing by the West for decades   it makes you wonder what future Western-backed campaigns might look like when aided by new tech, such as Spain s recent holographic protests, that featured thousands marching in avatar form.

In so many words, shaping masses in various aspects of behavior is literally seen as a science.Is mainstream  news reporting  above the fray and simply covering events?  Is shaping minds and creating trends limited to marketing and mass commercialism?  Probably not.  It is now becoming common knowledge that 6 umbrella corporations own about 90% of the media.

14563,OBAMA TO VISIT MOSQUE WHERE RADICAL IMAM Condones Suicide Bombings…Even MORE Unbelievable Is List Of Muslims Who Committed Horrific Acts Of Terror Against Americans Who Prayed There,"Our Imam In Chief told America he was a Christian when he wanted us to elect him in 2007. His Black Liberation Theology Pastor of hate later revealed that Barack only used the church as a way to boost his status as a community organizer. He s been openly mocking Christianity for years now and now, of all the mosques in America he feels compelled to visit, it just happens to be one with a radical Imam and ties to several terrorists who have committed atrocities against Americans.All is forgiven with ignorant liberals who believe terror organization CAIR, when they say Obama just wants to send a message of inclusion and mutual respect. President Obama is set to speak next week at a mosque which was led for over a decade by an Imam who justified suicide bombings in some circumstances and who helped found a mosque with ties to Al Qaeda.The President will visit the Islamic Society of Baltimore on Wednesday and deliver remarks there, the White House confirmed on Saturday. This will be the first time the President has paid an official visit to a mosque during his seven years as President. However, Obama has toured mosques while on overseas trips. The president believes that one of our nation s greatest strengths is our rich diversity,  White House spokesman Keith Maley said, confirming reports.  As the president has said, Muslim Americans are our friends, and neighbors; our co-workers, and sports heroes   and our men and women in uniform defending our country. The Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) which has been declared a terrorist organization in the United Arab Emirates and was named by federal prosecutors as an unindicted co-conspirator in the Holy Land Foundation s Hamas-funding operation welcomed Obama s decision. For a number of years we ve been encouraging the president to go to an American mosque,  said CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper.  With the tremendous rise in anti-Muslim sentiment in our country, we believe that it will send a message of inclusion and mutual respect. But critics of Obama s decision may question his choice of the Islamic Society of Baltimore, where Mohamad Adam el-Sheikh, a native of Sudan and former member of the Muslim Brotherhood, led the institution for eighteen years as its Imam.Before becoming Imam there, el-Sheikh helped found the Muslim American Society, an outfit created by Muslim Brotherhood members.In 2004, he told the Washington Post, commenting on Palestinian suicide bombers:  If certain Muslims are to be cornered where they cannot defend themselves, except through these kinds of means, and their local religious leaders issued fatwas to permit that, then it becomes acceptable as an exceptional rule, but should not be taken as a principle. El-Sheikh also helped found the Dar Al-Hijrah mosque, which was once led by the deceased infamous Al Qaeda terrorist Anwar Al Awlaki.When he left the Islamic Society of Baltimore, El Sheikh became the Imam of Dar Al-Hijrah, following Awlaki s escape from the U.S. after the September 11 attacks.The Dar Al-Hijrah mosque was founded thanks, in part, to a large grant from Saudi Arabia s Embassy in the United States, which allowed for the large facility to accommodate some 5,000 Muslims.Dar Al-Hijrah, which is located right outside Washington, D.C., is connected to several high-profile Islamic terrorists who prayed there, including Major Nidal Hassan   the Ft. Hood massacre jihadi, two September 11 hijackers, and an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.Via: Breitbart News",politics,"Jan 31, 2016"
19073,SERIOUSLY? PRO-ILLEGAL ALIEN Supporters Demand Cops Explain Why They Can’t Physically Attack Trump Supporters [VIDEO],"The video begins with a clearly agitated pro-illegal alien female approaching Trump supporters. After a few of the agitators who were part of her group began to act in a hostile and threatening manner, police officers stepped in to form a barrier between the groups. The human barrier they formed was clearly not okay with the agitators who were looking to use physical force to shut up and shut down their opponents. Shortly after the police officer explained that the Trump supporters had a permit (which means nothing to people who have no regard for the law and are actually protesting on behalf of lawbreakers), another man who appears to be Hispanic, wearing a hoodie began to aggressively approach the crowd. We re not sure if these people were being paid to threaten the pro-Trump supporters or if they just happened to be angry supporters of illegal aliens, and were in the area.The Hispanic man on the pro-Trump side in the background, who was holding a  Deport Illegals  sign can be heard telling the pro-illegal agitators that he s  a legal American citizen  and he stands by President Trump. He hilariously follows up his comment with,  Homies for Trump.

Donald Trump has never been shy about punching back when he s being unfairly attacked, and Democrat Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (NY) is no exception.

He was begging for my endorsement,  Trump said at a rally later in Portland, Maine. I could ve said,  Mitt, drop to your knees.  He was begging me,  Trump said.Trump was referring to the 2012 race for president in which Romney, the GOP nominee that year, sought Trump s endorsement.But if they were friendly four years ago, that relationship has clearly deteriorated.Earlier Thursday, Romney gave a speech in which he railed against Trump, whom he called a  fraud,   con man,   phony,  and  fake,  among other things. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University,  Romney jabbed.  He s playing the American public for suckers. He gets a free ride to the White House, and all we get is a lousy hat. Throughout Trump s subsequent speech in Maine, the real-estate developer repeatedly and extensively lashed back out at Romney. Mitt is a failed candidate   he failed badly,  Trump said.  That is a race that should have been won. He repeatedly called Romney a  choke artist  throughout the speech, an insult he s used against Marco Rubio, a top Trump rival for the 2016 nomination. He s a choke artist, I started hitting him so hard,  Trump said.  We can t take another loss. He choked, he choked like nobody I ve ever seen except for Rubio,  he continued.At other points in his speech, Trump called Romney a  disaster  candidate in 2012. The billionaire businessman then mentioned a fundraiser he held for Romney that  ruined  his carpet. Trump said Romney did not compensate him for the damages Senator Gillibrand was clearly not above cozying up to sexual predators for contributions or for leveraging their political clout.

2559, The Internet Rips Trump Adviser’s Face Off After Saying Sean Spicer Is Always ‘100 Percent Correct’,"Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller told ABC s This Week host George Stephanopoulos on Sunday that White House press secretary Sean Spicer is always  100 percent correct.  That s kind of weird since he literally fabricated a terrorist attack several times in order to defend Trump s Muslim ban. There is nothing Spicer won t lie about to defend the alleged president.Stephanopoulos said that Spicer mentioned  from the podium  that  the decision by Nordstrom to pull those products of Ivanka Trump was a direct attack on the president s policies  after the retailer pulled her clothing line due to poor sales.The ABC host noted that Sears and K-Mart decided this week to pull Trump s home furnishing lines from their websites. Is that a direct attack on the president s policies, as well?  Stephanopoulos asked. I m not going make a comment on that. I don t have any information on it,  Miller said.  I do want to say that Sean Spicer, as always, is 100 percent correct and that what he said is true and important. And I agree with it. He just said he has no knowledge of what happened but that Sean Spicer was correct. Welcome to the alternative-facts of the Trump administration. You had a case where somebody was treated unfairly. The president stuck up for a member of his family,  Miller continued.  And the White House counselor made a light-hearted, flippant comment that nobody would interpret as being what has been cast as right now by you and the media and others. The  flippant comment  Miller is referring to belongs to Kellyanne Conway in which she hawked Ivanka Trump s clothing line on the air while sitting in the briefing room.Watch: He also made a baseless claim about voter fraud which has been thoroughly debunked.Miller is trending on Twitter and he s being mocked over this crazy-time comments.I didn t realize Stephen Miller was a 12 year old boy.

Most Americans would likely agree that we need to address the viability of employment opportunities for poorly educated Americans of every race who are walking around with multiple facial piercings and tattoos on their faces.Donald Trump appeared on The O Reilly Factor Monday night, but for once it wasn t the presidential candidate making headlines for his controversial remarks.Instead, it was Bill O Reilly himself who sparked fury after making statements about African-Americans that many called racist.During the interview, O Reilly pointed out that Trump is not polling well among minority voters, and questioned the Republican front-runner about his strategy for winning over black voters.Trump responded by saying he was doing  fantastic with African-Americans and with Hispanics  before launching into a speech about how the real issue was that jobs were being outsourced to countries like China and Mexico.O Reilly then pushed Trump to explain exactly how he could promise jobs to black voters, while offending many African-Americans at the same time. How are you going to get jobs for them?  O Reilly asked.  Many of them are ill-educated and have tattoos on their foreheads, and I hate to be generalized about it but it s true, if you look at all the educational statistics, how are you going to give jobs to people who aren t qualified for jobs?

4139, SIX Witnesses Corroborate Sexual Assault Claim Made By ‘People’ Writer Against Trump,"Former People magazine writer Natasha Stoynoff has produced six witnesses who corroborate her allegations when she said Donald Trump was  pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat. We walked into that room alone, and Trump shut the door behind us. I turned around, and within seconds he was pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat,  she stated.Trump recently denied the story and later attacked Stoynoff while campaigning, saying,  She lies! Look at her, I don t think so. One of the witnesses is friend who was with Stoynoff when she ran into Melania Trump later in N.Y.C.Melania Trump is demanding a retraction and apology from People magazine, a move which surprises no one ever, especially since she previously threatened to sue bloggers for quoting from a source.The newest demand letter denies that Stoynoff and Melania ran into each other on the street that day. In states, in part,  The true facts are these: Mrs. Trump did not encounter Ms. Stoynoff on the street, nor have any conversation with her. Stoynoff s friend Liza Herz remembers the encounter. They chatted in a friendly way,  Herz says.  And what struck me most was that Melania was carrying a child and wearing heels. But, according to what Melania told  Anderson Cooper, that encounter never happened, saying, in part,  I was never friends with her, I would not recognize her. Stoynoff, though, was working on a profile of Melania s husband.People magazine reports:PEOPLE Editor in Chief Jess Cagle says in a statement about Stoynoff s piece,  In this week s issue of PEOPLE (which hits newsstands in New York on Wednesday), we feature a story that includes named sources who can corroborate Natasha Stoynoff s account   including one woman (a friend of Natasha s) who was actually with her when she bumped into Melania Trump on Fifth Ave., as outlined in her story. Five other witnesses also back up Stoynoff s account of her encounter with Trump.A longtime friend of Stoynoff s, Marina Grasic, said she got a phone call from her friend the day after the attack. During that call Stoynoff detailed everything about the assault.Grasic said Stoynoff felt embarrassed and even thought of Trump s then-pregnant wife Melania when deciding not to come forward about the incident. Natasha was also struggling about not hurting pregnant Melania if the story came out,  Grasic says.  Beyond just the attack, she was horrified by the vulgar circumstances under which she was attacked and propositioned to have an affair. She was there in a professional capacity, writing an article about their happy marriage, and after the incident Trump acted like nothing happened.

20835,OBAMA RACES TO SET GITMO TERRORISTS FREE…Leaves Servicemen Punished For Making “Heat-of-the-battle decisions that saved lives” In Fort Leavenworth,"It s hard to imagine a President who could be more anti-American and more pro-terror than Barack Hussein Obama. And then my mind drifts to Hillary and Benghazi The Obama administration is emptying the military s Guantanamo Bay detention facility of avowed terrorists captured fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, but several American service members languish in another military prison for actions on those same battlefields that their supporters say merit clemency, if not gratitude.Among the prison population at Fort Leavenworth, in Kansas, are remaining members of the so-called  Leavenworth 10,  convicted service members doing terms ranging from 10 to 40 years for heat-of-the-battle decisions their supporters say saved American lives.[quote_box_center] The very people who protect our freedoms and liberties are having their own freedoms and liberties taken away,  said retired U.S. Army Col. Allen West, a former congressman and political commentator.  I think it s appalling and no one is talking about this issue. [/quote_box_center]The  Leavenworth 10  is the name given to a fluctuating number of men housed at Leavenworth for actions in Iraq and Afghanistan that their supporters say were justified. Over the years, a handful have been paroled, and more have been incarcerated.Among the more well-known cases is that of Army First Lt. Clint Lorance, who is serving a 20-year sentence for ordering his men to shoot two suspected Taliban scouts in July 2012 in the Kandahar Province of Afghanistan. Lorance had just taken command of the platoon after the prior leader and several others were killed days before. The Taliban suspects were on motorcycles and matched descriptions given by a pilot who flew over the area earlier and spotted them as scouts.A Facebook page devoted to Lorance s case has drawn more than 12,000 likes, and supporters have launched a website, FreeClintLorance.com, dedicated to winning his release. A WhiteHouse.gov petition calling for Lorance to be pardoned garnered nearly 125,000 signatures, but the White House has not taken action.Critics say Lorance was given a military trial, and his conviction was based in large part on the testimony of men serving under him.It was September of 2010 when Sgt. Derrick Miller of Maryland, on a combat mission in a Taliban-held area of Afghanistan, was warned the unit s base had been penetrated. An Afghan suspected of being an enemy combatant was brought to Miller for interrogation and wound up dead. Miller claimed the suspect tried to grab his gun and that he shot him in self-defense. But he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.U.S. Army Master Sgt. John Hatley   a highly decorated, 20-year vet who served in Operation Desert Storm and did another three tours during the Iraq War   also is serving a life sentence at Leavenworth. His conviction stems from an April, 2007, incident in Iraq in which he and his unit captured enemies following a firefight. He radioed a U.S. detention facility to notify officials he was bringing in four prisoners, but was ordered to let them go, according to his legal team.Two years later, a sergeant who had served with Hatley, Jesse Cunningham, was facing charges for assaulting another officer and falling asleep at his post. As leverage for a plea deal, he told investigators that Hatley and two other officers had taken the insurgents to a remote location, blindfolded them and shot each in the back of the head. He claimed their bodies were dumped in a canal, though none was ever found.Hatley, now 47, insists he and his men let the insurgents go, but believes he was punished in the interest of the government s relations with Baghdad. When concerns over appeasing a foreign country are allowed to interfere with justice for the purpose of the U.S. government or the military demonstrating that we, the military or the U.S. government will hold our soldiers accountable using a fatally flawed military judicial system, it doesn t matter what the truth is; it matters only that there is only the appearance of the truth,  he wrote in a message to supporters posted on freeJohnHatley.com.Law experts say military service members face a daunting task once accused of committing crimes in the heat of war. Killing on the battlefield is not the same as [a police officer] killing someone on the streets,  Dan Conway, an attorney who specializes in military law, told FoxNews.com.  When a cop uses force, there s a line of duty investigation. When a soldier uses force, it is investigated as criminal, and non-infantry investigators handle the case, many who have no combat experience. If you had experts handling the investigation, you d have much more balance,  he added.While the military rightly holds its soldiers to a high standard of justice, detainees housed at Guantanamo Bay have been freed even with no mitigating circumstances or reasonable belief of rehabilitation. The release of Gitmo detainees began during the presidency of George W. Bush in 2005 when nearly 200 detainees were released before any tribunals were held.According to a March 2015 memo released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, of the 647 detainees transferred or released, 17.9 percent were confirmed of re-engaging in extremist activity with another 10.7 percent suspected of doing the same.

In fact, it was nothing short of a love fest that threatened to ruin the day for serious sports fans.Joined by the first lady for the first time, it was a given that the Obamas complained   about such things like bad Wi-Fi service at the White House   before discussing first dates and post-presidency plans, among other hard-hitting topics.The first lady said she cared  deeply about the halftime game show,  likely because pal Beyonc , one of this year s halftime performers, was planning to get political in support of Black Lives Matter. I got dressed for the halftime show,  Michelle said.  I hope Beyonc  likes what I ve got on. Mrs. Obama was dressed in all black, we assume in simpatico with the artist s dancers who performed in wardrobes that resembled the Black Panthers. The only thing missing was a Black Panther beret. Furious Americans are expressing their disappointment and outrage that the Super Bowl halftime show was allowed to be hijacked for political purposes and given a racist, black power theme.Read more: Biz Pac Review",left-news,"Feb 8, 2016"
14452,HOW PRESIDENT EISENHOWER Solved The Illegal Immigration Problem In America,"Since this article was written in 2006, the illegal immigration crisis in America has exploded. Barack Obama, his fellow Democrats, leftist organizations (and even some Republicans beholden to corporations who desire cheap labor in America), have desperately tried to shame Americans into accepting amnesty as the only option to solve this crisis. One doesn t have to look too far to see how miserably they have failed. Americans are not interested in giving up our jobs, our national security or the future of our country so the Democrat party can have a monopoly on voters, or to make it easier for business and corporations to hire cheap labor.  It is no accident that Donald Trump experienced a meteoric rise in the polls after he boldly proclaimed he would make building a wall on our southern border a priority. The media tried to shame him, only causing him to double down, claiming he would not only build the biggest and best wall on our southern border, but he claimed that Mexico would pay for it. This article is for all of the naysayers who believe the illegal immigration crisis can t be solved. The problem can be solved. We just needed a President with a backbone, who loves his country, is willing to take bold moves to secure our nation and most of all, a President who truly believes Americans come first.Over fifty years ago, when newly elected Dwight Eisenhower moved into the White House, America s southern frontier was as porous as a spaghetti sieve. As many as 3 million illegal migrants had walked and waded northward over a period of several years for jobs in California, Arizona, Texas, and points beyond.President Eisenhower cut off this illegal traffic. He did it quickly and decisively with only 1,075 United States Border Patrol agents   less than one-tenth of today s force. The operation is still highly praised among veterans of the Border Patrol.Although there is little to no record of this operation in Ike s official papers, one piece of historic evidence indicates how he felt. In 1951, Ike wrote a letter to Sen. William Fulbright (D) of Arkansas. The senator had just proposed that a special commission be created by Congress to examine unethical conduct by government officials who accepted gifts and favors in exchange for special treatment of private individuals.General Eisenhower, who was gearing up for his run for the presidency, said  Amen  to Senator Fulbright s proposal. He then quoted a report in The New York Times, highlighting one paragraph that said:  The rise in illegal border-crossing by Mexican  wetbacks  to a current rate of more than 1,000,000 cases a year has been accompanied by a curious relaxation in ethical standards extending all the way from the farmer-exploiters of this contraband labor to the highest levels of the Federal Government. Years later, the late Herbert Brownell Jr., Eisenhower s first attorney general, said in an interview with this writer that the president had a sense of urgency about illegal immigration when he took office.America  was faced with a breakdown in law enforcement on a very large scale,  Mr. Brownell said.  When I say large scale, I mean hundreds of thousands were coming in from Mexico [every year] without restraint. Although an on-and-off guest-worker program for Mexicans was operating at the time, farmers and ranchers in the Southwest had become dependent on an additional low-cost, docile, illegal labor force of up to 3 million, mostly Mexican, laborers.According to the Handbook of Texas Online, published by the University of Texas at Austin and the Texas State Historical Association, this illegal workforce had a severe impact on the wages of ordinary working Americans.The Handbook Online reports that a study by the President s Commission on Migratory Labor in Texas in 1950 found that cotton growers in the Rio Grande Valley, where most illegal aliens in Texas worked, paid wages that were  approximately half  the farm wages paid elsewhere in the state.Profits from illegal labor led to the kind of corruption that apparently worried Eisenhower. Joseph White, a retired 21-year veteran of the Border Patrol, says that in the early 1950s, some senior US officials overseeing immigration enforcement  had friends among the ranchers,  and agents  did not dare  arrest their illegal workers.Walt Edwards, who joined the Border Patrol in 1951, tells a similar story. He says:  When we caught illegal aliens on farms and ranches, the farmer or rancher would often call and complain [to officials in El Paso]. And depending on how politically connected they were, there would be political intervention. That is how we got into this mess we are in now. Bill Chambers, who worked for a combined 33 years for the Border Patrol and the then-called US Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), says politically powerful people are still fueling the flow of illegals.During the 1950s, however, this  Good Old Boy  system changed under Eisenhower   if only for about 10 years.In 1954, Ike appointed retired Gen. Joseph  Jumpin  Joe  Swing, a former West Point classmate and veteran of the 101st Airborne, as the new INS commissioner.Influential politicians, including Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson (D) of Texas and Sen. Pat McCarran (D) of Nevada, favored open borders, and were dead set against strong border enforcement, Brownell said. But General Swing s close connections to the president shielded him   and the Border Patrol   from meddling by powerful political and corporate interests.One of Swing s first decisive acts was to transfer certain entrenched immigration officials out of the border area to other regions of the country where their political connections with people such as Senator Johnson would have no effect.Then on June 17, 1954, what was called  Operation Wetback  began. Because political resistance was lower in California and Arizona, the roundup of aliens began there. Some 750 agents swept northward through agricultural areas with a goal of 1,000 apprehensions a day. By the end of July, over 50,000 aliens were caught in the two states. Another 488,000, fearing arrest, had fled the country.By mid-July, the crackdown extended northward into Utah, Nevada, and Idaho, and eastward to Texas.By September, 80,000 had been taken into custody in Texas, and an estimated 500,000 to 700,000 illegals had left the Lone Star State voluntarily.Unlike today, Mexicans caught in the roundup were not simply released at the border, where they could easily reenter the US. To discourage their return, Swing arranged for buses and trains to take many aliens deep within Mexico before being set free.Tens of thousands more were put aboard two hired ships, the Emancipation and the Mercurio. The ships ferried the aliens from Port Isabel, Texas, to Vera Cruz, Mexico, more than 500 miles south.The sea voyage was  a rough trip, and they did not like it,  says Don Coppock, who worked his way up from Border Patrolman in 1941 to eventually head the Border Patrol from 1960 to 1973.Mr. Coppock says he  cannot understand why [President] Bush let [today s] problem get away from him as it has. I guess it was his compassionate conservatism, and trying to please [Mexican President] Vincente Fox. There are now said to be 12 million to 20 million illegal aliens in the US. Of the Mexicans who live here, an estimated 85 percent are here illegally.Border Patrol vets offer tips on curbing illegal immigration One day in 1954, Border Patrol agent Walt Edwards picked up a newspaper in Big Spring, Texas, and saw some startling news. The government was launching an all-out drive to oust illegal aliens from the United States.The orders came straight from the top, where the new president, Dwight Eisenhower, had put a former West Point classmate, Gen. Joseph Swing, in charge of immigration enforcement.General Swing s fast-moving campaign soon secured America s borders   an accomplishment no other president has since equaled. Illegal migration had dropped 95 percent by the late 1950s.Several retired Border Patrol agents who took part in the 1950s effort, including Mr. Edwards, say much of what Swing did could be repeated today. Some say we cannot send 12 million illegals now in the United States back where they came from. Of course we can!  Edwards says.Donald Coppock, who headed the Patrol from 1960 to 1973, says that if Swing and Ike were still running immigration enforcement,  they d be on top of this in a minute. William Chambers, another  50s veteran, agrees.  They could do a pretty good job  sealing the border.Edwards says:  When we start enforcing the law, these various businesses are, on their own, going to replace their [illegal] workforce with a legal workforce. While Congress debates building a fence on the border, these veterans say other actions should have higher priority.1. End the current practice of taking captured Mexican aliens to the border and releasing them. Instead, deport them deep into Mexico, where return to the US would be more costly.2. Crack down hard on employers who hire illegals. Without jobs, the aliens won t come.3. End  catch and release  for non-Mexican aliens. It is common for illegal migrants not from Mexico to be set free after their arrest if they promise to appear later before a judge. Few show up.The Patrol veterans say enforcement could also be aided by a legalized guest- worker program that permits Mexicans to register in their country for temporary jobs in the US. Eisenhower s team ran such a program. It permitted up to 400,000 Mexicans a year to enter the US for various agriculture jobs that lasted for 12 to 52 weeks. Via: CS Monitor",politics,"Feb 19, 2016"
19317,“BIKERS FOR TRUMP” Vow To Defend Trump During Inauguration Day…Plan Celebration! [Video], ,left-news,"Jan 13, 2017"
18667,Son Of Egyptian Immigrants Hopes To Become FIRST MUSLIM GOVERNOR In U.S…Will Push For “Sanctuary State”,"Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, a liberal Democrat would like to become the nation s first Muslim Governor in a state that s home to the city of Dearborn, with the highest Muslim population outside of the Middle East. The state of Michigan also made news last year when Hamtramck, a city that for decades was known for it s strong Polish immigrant community, elected its first all-Muslim City Council. It s probably not that far-fetched that the son of Egyptian immigrants living in a state where tens of thousands of Muslim refugees and immigrants come to live would want to see the state of MI become a  Sanctuary State . My faith is really important to me, as it is for many Americans and Michiganders,  El-Sayed said.  But I think we should be asking ourselves rather than how one prays, or what they pray to, we should ask ourselves what [one] prays for and what one hopes for. While El-Sayed said his Islamic values are at the center of his work as a civil servant, he wants people to know his number one priority is to serve the people of Michigan.But some residents in the state may not be ready to see a Muslim governor. In the last several years, Michigan has been a hotbed of Islamophobia. Dearborn, a predominantly Arab-American city in the Detroit metro area, has been a frequent target of anti-Muslim activists, conspiracy theories and fake news. But El-Sayed doesn t want Michigan residents to be distracted by anti-Muslim rhetoric and violence   and he wants people to know that the principles of Islam are what guide his service. I am running because of the values my Islam teaches me   which includes beliefs in equity, the fundamental rights of all people, a belief that we will judge ourselves as a people based on how we treat the most vulnerable,  El-Sayed said.  A belief in being good to others fundamentally, a belief in respect and dignity to one s neighbors and one s friends and one s family. -Business InsiderDemocratic gubernatorial candidate Abdul El-Sayed is starting to propose a progressive platform that includes making Michigan a  sanctuary state,  providing universal preschool and offering publicly funded health insurance to any resident needing coverage.The ex-director of Detroit s health department unveiled parts of his platform Monday.I love it when the rule of law works #sanctuarycities https://t.co/3X4kJBu4WZ  Abdul El-Sayed (@AbdulElSayed) April 26, 2017El-Sayed claims that a Sanctuary State will make Michiganders safer. As a Michigander, I can assure you that making our state a  Sanctuary State  will not only make it less safe, but it will cause many people to move away to states who have laws against law-breakers.(3/3) if elected #gov my job is protecting #Michiganders, that's what #SanctuaryState will do.

US NewsEl-Sayed also made his feelings known on Twitter about a MI lawmaker, Rep. Michele Hoitenga, R-Manton,MI who wants to make Sharia Law illegal in that state of Michigan. El-Sayed attempts to make the comparison of the 10 commandments and the Holy Bible to Sharia Law.

21395,CHILLING: How America Looks After 8 Long Years With An Anti-American President,"The shocking truth about how close we are to becoming a one-party fascist stateThis is the most brilliant and scary analysis of where we, as a nation are today Last year a retired Border Patrol Officer by the name of Zach Taylor went on camera to explain the driving force behind the unprecedented surge in illegal immigration happening on our southern border. Taylor went on to note that what was happening at our border was not due to a spur of the moment event, or  a humanitarian crisis , but asymmetrical warfare. The surge we saw at the border was apart of a larger more chilling event that served one purpose and one purpose only, to show our enemies that our southern border had been compromised and the government wouldn t do a damn thing about it.The border was destroyed because of the actions taken by President Barack Obama under the guise of his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) plan. Simply put, DACA rewrote our immigration laws and created the incentive for illegal aliens to break our laws as Obama deliberately undermined our nation s sovereignty by simply creating his own. The culmination of Obama s DACA has resulted in over 790,000 illegal aliens entering the country from the middle of 2013 to May of 2015, for a total of 2.5 million new illegal immigrants since Obama took office in January of 2009.While the threat comes from without, in this case millions of illegal immigrants, it could not have been possible without the enemy already being inside of the United States. As Mr. Taylor states,  If asymmetrical warfare is going to be successful, the first thing that has to be done is to compromise America s defense against invasion because they have to have their personnel inside the United States to affect the infrastructure   our hospitals, our schools, our electric grid, our power supplies, our water supply   basically what we call infrastructure [which] effects the degeneration from inside the United States.  By drawing away the resources that are intended to protect the United States border in order to care for the illegal immigrants, the border is now wide open and our infrastructure is overloaded. Yet, the  crisis on the border  is only a small part of the larger warfare that s being waged against our country at the hands of our own president. Today the Obama juggernaut is systematically bankrupting our country, and undoing the constitutional arrangements our Founders left to us , writes David Horowitz in his book Fight Fire With Fire. The contempt of the Obama party for consultative and representative government is relentlessly on display. Horowitz goes on to give the example of what our enemy represents with the following statement uttered by then Senate Majority leader Harry Reid as he defended his refusal to negotiate with Republicans over Obamacare and the debt crisis. Reid stated in these words:  We are here to support the federal government. That s our job.  End quote. You ll notice that representing the people for whom our Constitution makes sovereign is not included in Reid s statement.Horowitz then writes the following: My years as a radical prepared me to see much of this coming. But even I never thought we would be looking so soon at the prospect of a one-party system and a fascist state. Those words may sound hyperbolic, but take a moment to think about it. If you have transformed the taxing agency of the state into a political weapon   and Obama has; if you are setting up a massive government program to collect and file the financial and health information of every citizen, and also to control their access to care; and if you have a spy agency that can read the mail and listen to the communications of every individual in the country, you don t really need a secret police to destroy political opponents. You already have the means to do it. This is all the more troubling when you look at the sheer amount of data the Obama administration, or shall I say the Obama government, is collecting on each and every individual living in the United States. To effect the degeneration of the country from within the Obama administration has weaponized the IRS, DOJ, and FBI to target Americans who oppose their agenda. Now, the White House has added a key tool in their arsenal by prying into our most personal information at the most local levels, all for the purpose of  racial and economic justice.  On Saturday, Paul Sperry of the New York Post, uncovered the latest Obama plan that is aimed at collecting personal data for a secret race database. Sperry writes,  Unbeknown to most Americans, Obama s racial bean counters are furiously mining data on their health, home loans, credit cards, places of work, neighborhoods, even how their kids are disciplined in school   all to document  inequalities  between minorities and whites.  It may sound conspiratorial but under this government the only conspiracy is that being committed against Americans who are too distracted by today s latest ginned up political crisis.Sperry continues by noting that,  this Orwellian-style stockpile of statistics includes a vast and permanent network of discrimination databases, which Obama already is using to make  disparate impact  cases against: banks that don t make enough prime loans to minorities; schools that suspend too many blacks; cities that don t offer enough Section 8 and other low-income housing for minorities; and employers who turn down African-Americans for jobs due to criminal backgrounds. Big Brother Barack wants the databases operational before he leaves office, and much of the data in them will be posted online.  This means that so called civil-rights attorneys like those working for the ACLU and urban activist groups will be able to exploit them to show patterns of  racial disparities  and  segregation,  even if no other evidence of discrimination exists. Such databases have never before existed. Obama is presiding over the largest consolidation of personal data in US history. He is creating a diversity police state where government race cops and civil-rights lawyers will micromanage demographic outcomes in virtually every aspect of society , concludes Sperry. If you were to add all the databases created under this administration, including the Obamacare database, known as MIDAS, which retains tens of millions of Obamacare enrollees information, you could quiet literally make the claim that the federal government has data on every single American citizen. In the hands of someone like Obama this becomes of grave concern given his willingness to use such information against his opponents. Now that this information will be made public in order to extort communities deemed  too segregated . Whether it be through the withholding of federal funds for a local community showing a pattern of  racial disparity  or lawsuits against a school that disciplines minorities more than whites, it doesn t much matter. The government will be able to force you to act in a way that it deems socially acceptable as Obama drastically changes the racial makeup of America by enshrining an infrastructure that will continue long after he s gone.All the while this is happening below the surface and under the radar from most Americans, we remain and for good reason, distracted by the latest crisis of the day. A Christian owned Oregon bakery is forced by the state to pay a fine for not baking a cake for a lesbian couple, a woman is killed by an illegal immigrant and 7-time convicted felon in San Francisco, four Marines and one Navy Officer are executed by an Islamic jihadist; none of this would be happening but for Obama s actions. He knew that ISIS had put out a hit list specifically targeting our military, and he did nothing. He cheered on the Supreme Court ruling that legalized gay marriage knowing that it would be used in a way to exploit and destroy businesses specifically owned by Christians. He created the  sanctuary city  policy that has served to protect illegal immigrants while they rape, murder, and assault American citizens like Kate Steinle in San Francisco.All of this is happening because of the enemy we have in the White House. The country is being brought to its knees by overt acts such as the jihadist attack that was met with no response, to covert acts such as the Obama race database. Yet, no resistance is met to counter the agenda of the Obama adminstration. Even the capacity of the American people to determine their own national interests are being torn asunder without any fight, without even so much as a whimper from Congress. Without a pushback, the adminstration goes about acting without repercussion held to no degree of accountability. With impeachment and the power of the purse both taken off the table by Congress, America is literally at the whim of Obama as the only checks that exist today on what the president can do is what he personally thinks he can get away with and what his political incentives are.So the adminstration pushes full steam ahead without any concern for the American people themselves. Nowhere is this more apparent, on a foreign policy scale, than with the adminstration s nuclear deal with Iran. As Andrew McCarthy of National Review writes,  At the U.N. today, the Obama administration is colluding with our enemies and other foreign sovereigns to deprive the American people   through their elected representatives   of the power to determine what obligations they will accept under international law. The Obama administration has taken the position that Russia, China, and, yes, Iran, have a vote on our national security, but we do not. And in this betrayal, Congress has, at best, been a witless aider and abettor.  At worst, they ve gone along with the adminstration in committing treason against the United States of America.I believe in the latter.Via: Politically Short",left-news,"Oct 23, 2015"
7467, MSNBC Host Can’t Help But Be Perfectly Sexist To Hillary Clinton After Her Big Night (TWEET),"Tuesday night was a very big night for Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton. The former Secretary of State had a clean sweep of wins across all five states that held primaries. These wins will help push her forward towards her path of securing the Democratic nomination for president.However, where there is the glory of being declared the victor, there will always be someone there to tear you down, and not just in a way coming from the opposition, but rather in weird unexpected ways. Such as, being told one is not celebrating properly. Which is exactly what MSNBC Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough did to Hillary Tuesday night.Apparently, according to Scarborough, HillaryClinton wasn t gleeful enough to his liking, and wasn t presenting herself in a way that he thought she should be on her victorious evening. If you watched Hillary s speech, she was, in fact very happy and gleeful, but apparently Scarborough thought differently. So, he told her to  smile. Smile. You just had a big night. #PrimaryDay  Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) March 16, 2016If Hillary never smiled for the rest of her life, guess what, that s perfectly fine. Scarborough has no right to tell a woman she needs to smile just because he thinks she should.Telling a woman to smile is ridiculously sexist. If you can t grasp that it is, that likely says more about you than it does about anyone else. Women shouldn t be required to smile at the drop of a hat just because someone thinks they should. If it s not required of men, why should it be of women? Not to mention the fact that it is SO annoying. Women, and I speak for myself as someone who has been told to smile regularly, are, quite frankly, tired of it.However, leave it to Samantha Bee to let him know that it s perfectly okay for a woman not to smile all the frickin  time..@JoeNBC pic.twitter.com/YZHVIKxE8O  Full Frontal (@FullFrontalSamB) March 16, 2016Which is also how women should look at Joe Scarborough from now on.Featured image via Instagram",News,"March 16, 2016"
2346, Veterans SHRED Trump For Exploiting Navy SEAL’s Death While Press FAWNS All Over Him For It,"Trump s address to a joint session of Congress last night was long on old and tired talking points, and short on substance and concrete plans. Many lawmakers present had invited guests, and, of course, Trump invited his own guests, too, which presidents do. One of his guests was Carryn Owens, wife of slain Navy SEAL Ryan Owens, who was lost during the botched raid in Yemen.The press fawned all over Trump for that, talking about the emotional, touching moment in which Trump actually became presidential. Then there were veterans on social media who felt differently. Many feel that Trump did nothing but exploit Ms. Owens, her grief, and the death of her husband. They were quite clear in how they saw it:       Then there s U.S. Army veteran Charles Clymer, who was so livid he went on a mini-tweetstorm about it:      But here s the press  reaction. The fawning is gag-inducing, especially  from those who routinely speak out against Trump.         That s a stark difference. Trump used Ms. Owens like he always uses people. He was trying to puff himself up, score points, and distract attention from the poorly-planned and executed Yemen raid, which even DHS says yielded no useful intelligence.Our fighting men and women put their lives on the line for us. It would be one thing if the intelligence for the Yemen raid was confirmed to be good, and the raid itself was as carefully planned and executed as it could possibly be. Things go wrong with even the best-planned missions   that s a fact. But that s not what happened in Yemen, and our military members shouldn t have to die for an administration that hastily throws an operation together, and then lies about the result. Owens deserves so much more than this, and his blood is on Trump s hands.Featured image by Jim Lo Scalzo via Getty Images",News,"March 1, 2017"

The President-elect didn t call it into question, he called on Russia to hack his opponent. He called on Russia to hack Secretary Clinton. So he certainly had a pretty good sense of whose side this cyberactivity was coming down on. The last several week so the election were focused on a discussion of emails that had been hacked and leaked by the Russians. These were emails from the (Democratic National Committee) and John Podesta, not from the (Republican National Committee) and Stephen Bannon. It was the President-elect who over the course of the campaign indicated that he thought that President Putin was a strong leader. The President-elect s team, his campaign, did not make any effort to obscure this. The President-elect has said one thing on Twitter. The 17 intelligence agencies have come forward with unanimous assessment about Russia s malicious cyberactivity. I ll let you and the American people judge who s in a better position to defend their argument.

5836," Thanks To Trump, Companies Are Pulling Out Of The Republican National Convention","Now that Republicans are only a month away from officially nominating a racist, sexist, bigot, companies responsible for funding the Republican National Convention are pulling out, and for good reason: bigotry isn t good for business.Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, Motorola, Ford, Walgreens and UPS (all of whom sponsored the 2012 convention) have announced they will be pulling out of this year s convention. Although none of the companies have publicly said why they are pulling out, Trump s continuous slamming of the Ford Corporation could explain why the motor company is calling it quits. Sources close with Wells Fargo say they will continue to sponsor the Democratic National Convention because of a large market outreach in Philadelphia.Coca-Cola has also pulled out of the RNC, citing bad publicity.Reports are surfacing that delegates for the RNC are gearing up to stage a coup against trump, thus brokering the convention and thwarting the billionaire s chances of taking on Hillary Clinton (who would mop the floor with him).Their decision to pull out comes as the RNC is close to reaching their goal of $64 million to fund the convention. With these companies now retracting their monetary support, the RNC will have to find new ways to make up for the lost funds. Maybe they could ask their nominee? He is a  billionaire,  after all.Several months ago, the New York Times reported Apple, Walmart, and Google are considering pulling out as well, as public pressure mounts against the presumptive nominee.Republican fundraising consultant Carla Eudy told the Times:I have talked to several people at companies who have said,  I ve always gone to the convention, I ve always participated at some level, but this year we re not putting it in our budget, we re not going, we re no going to sponsor any of the events going on.Things aren t looking good for the RNC, and yet Reince Priebus insists everything is O.K. when, in fact, nothing is O.K.

312, Democrat Takes Trump To The Woodshed In Fiery Speech Defending NFL (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is getting absolutely hammered for his recent attacks on NFL players who refuse to stand during the National Anthem in a stand against social injustice. Trump has tried his hardest to pass off those attacks as a defense of patriotism, but most Americans know that Trump is simply trying to mask what are obviously remarks fueled by his own racism   and one Democrat is calling him out for it.Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., blasted Trump on the House floor on Monday and attacked the undeserving POTUS for his pathetic attacks on athletes such as Stephen Curry, Lebron James and the NFL players. In his powerful, fiery speech, Jeffries asked the question that most of us would like to know:  How dare Donald lecture us on what s patriotic?!  You can watch this epic speech below:Just defended @StephenCurry30 @KingJames @Kaepernick7 on House floor. How dare donald lecture us on what s patriotic?! pic.twitter.com/wfbtDajTLD  Hakeem Jeffries (@RepJeffries) September 25, 2017And that s not the only time Jeffries has spoken out against Trump about the POTUS  recent attacks on athletes. In an interview with CNN, Jeffries called Trump a  racial arsonist  and stated that Trump was causing controversy just to keep his dwindling conservative fan base happy and engaged. Jeffries said: He uses race to advance his own ends. We couldn t have said it better. It is no coincidence that Trump s fan base are practically just white supremacists   who he has repeatedly failed to denounce because he doesn t want to lost the only support he has left. Trump knows that his fans are losing interest and patience after all of his broken campaign promises, so he creates these  scandals  and spews nonsense to distract everyone and remind his racist fans why they voted for him in the first place. Trump s remarks about the NFL are disgusting and deserve to be condemned again and again.Featured image is a screenshot",News,"September 25, 2017"
11466,CONSERVATIVES FIGHT BACK Against Proposed “Obamacare Lite”…DEMAND Full Repeal Of Obamacare,"House Republicans leaders on Monday embraced a legislative plan to replace the Affordable Care Act for the first time in the nearly seven years since Democrats enacted the transformative health-insurance law.Now, they have to sell it.That challenge ran into an immediate threat from key conservatives who criticized the new proposal for failing to fulfill the party s iron-clad promise to rip out the signature policy of former President Barack Obama.  It s Obamacare in a different format,  Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a member of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, said in a phone interview. Jordan cited three provisions that conservatives have complained about for weeks leading up to the formal release of the House GOP plan on Monday evening: its extension of Obamacare Medicaid expansion for another four years; its failure to immediately repeal all of the law s tax increases; and its call to provide refundable tax credits to help people buy insurance, which Jordan labeled  a new entitlement. Earlier on Monday, another member of the Freedom Caucus, Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, condemned the leadership bill in a two-word tweet:  Obamacare 2.0.  The full Freedom Caucus comprises about three dozen members of the 237 in the House Republican majority. If they voted as a bloc, they could sink the bill on their own. A spokeswoman for its chairman, Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, said members were still reviewing the legislation on Monday evening, and Jordan said the group planned to meet on Tuesday to discuss it.The reaction from conservative advocacy groups was no more favorable to the Republican leadership. FreedomWorks labeled the plan s requirement that people pay a 30 percent premium to insurers if they stop their coverage for more than two months  the Republican individual mandate. And on Tuesday morning, two more staunchly conservative activist organizations, Heritage Action and the Club for Growth, came out against the proposal.  Many Americans seeking health insurance on the individual market will notice no significant difference between the Affordable Care Act (i.e., Obamacare) and the American Health Care Act,  the group s president, Michael Needham said.  That is bad politics and, more importantly, bad policy. Rather than accept the flawed premises of Obamacare, congressional Republicans should fully repeal the failed law and begin a genuine effort to deliver on longstanding campaign promises that create a free market health-care system that empowers patients and doctors.  The Club for Growth pejoratively dubbed the new bill  RyanCare  and added a new threat, vowing to downgrade any Republican who votes for the bill in the group s closely-watched annual congressional scorecard.- The AtlanticThe introduction of the GOP s new healthcare bill has raised some definite ire among Republicans and Libertarians alike. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is one such politician who has now seen the bill and expressed his extreme dislike of it, calling the GOP plan  Obamacare Lite. According to The Hill, Paul is not letting Obamacare Lite happen without a fight, and he has allies. The libertarian leaning senator is teaming up with Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) to release their own bill to repeal Obamacare on Wednesday, and it s highly similar to the one that Republicans voted for unanimously in 2015. We voted on this last year, and every Republican voted for it,  Paul said at a press conference alongside his House conservative colleagues.  That s what we should do again. You have to get rid of ObamaCare completely,  Jordan added. Paul stated in an interview earlier today that this GOP bill  will not pass,  and that  conservatives aren t gonna to take it.  However Paul and Jordan face an uphill struggle as GOP leadership, including that of President Donald Trump, seem to believe the bill to be a solid plan. We re going to do something that s great. And I am proud to support the replacement plan released by the House of Representatives,  Trump said of the bill.  It follows the guidelines I laid out in my congressional address. This will be a plan where you can choose your doctor and this will be a plan where you can choose your plan. And you know what the plan is. This is the plan.    The Blaze",politics,"Mar 7, 2017"

4447, Even His Allies Admit Hillary Won The Debate And Trump Is FREAKING OUT About It,"Unless you count online polls that Trump fans voted in multiple times to make it appear as if he won Monday s presidential debate, Donald Trump actually lost. Most pundits feel he lost, as did the focus groups used by several of the networks, as did scientific polls that were taken of people who watched the event. He lost, handily.Trump lost so badly that even his allies who want to see him elected President have been complaining to the media about his limp performance. And that has made Trump very very angry.In a conference call with surrogates Wednesday afternoon, Trump aides made clear the Republican nominee is upset that his allies publicly acknowledged they pushed him to change his preparation and tactics before his next bout with Hillary Clinton. And he wants them to stop it immediately.The message was  not subtle,  a source familiar with the call said.Trump wants his supporters to make an energetic defense of his performance and refuse to concede that he didn t nail it.In the world of Trump and his ego, admitting that you lost a battle is the worst thing, possibly even worse than actually losing the battle itself. For someone like Trump, who fancies himself an  alpha  male, an admission of humility or defeat is the worst possible scenario. In his eyes, anyone conceding that he underperformed is unacceptable, and even worse if you re in the Trump orbit.That is why Trump almost completely limits himself to media appearances on Fox News, where he won t ever seriously be challenged on even the most bizarre and untrue claims he makes in the campaign. Trump is inside a bubble, only speaking to those who agree with him and who want to suck up to him. He is being told time and time again by his hangers-on that he is doing everything just right. And he won t tolerate anybody who allows reality to intrude.Featured image via Flickr",News,"September 28, 2016"

No Obama doesn t do anything without injecting Chicago style politics into the equation. In this case, he will only endorse one of the dumbest men in Washington DC for our next President if he agrees to his radical terms.How very  Putin-esque The talk in Democratic Party circles is that Barack Obama has told Joe Biden that he is prepared to endorse him for president if, in return, Biden promises to let Obama have a final say in the choice of his vice presidential running mate.According to these Democratic sources, Biden is mulling over the president s conditional offer of support.In addition, there is speculation among top Democratic sources that Obama has another quid pro quo for his endorsement: he wants Biden to choose an African American as his vice presidential running mate.In this scenario, which Obama has not yet fully explained to Biden, Biden would promise to serve only one term in the White House, after which he would back his vice president to succeed him.As Biden s vice president, Obama is said to favor former Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, a close Obama ally who is the first and only African American to have served as governor of the Bay State.Obama has already given Biden carte blanche to use Air Force Two, the official vice presidential plane, to crisscross the country and launch an unofficial campaign.So far, Biden has visited several key primary and general election states and hammered GOP frontrunner Donald Trump, charging that Trump is offering a  sick message  on immigration.Biden has also courted the Jewish vote, hinting that he will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.With Obama s blessing, Biden appeared on  The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,  where he discussed his son Beau s death from brain cancer and came across as an authentic alternative to the stiff and overly scripted Hillary Clinton.

6602, WATCH: New Music Video Calls On Supporters To Keep Rallying For Bernie Sanders,"Bernie Sanders, the upstart and relatively unknown senator from Vermont, has captured the hearts and minds of people from all generations and walks of life, especially young Americans who are the future of tomorrow. He s ignited a passion for the political process not seen in generations. One of his gifts has been his ability to explain the major issues America is facing today and to offer actual solutions to problems. His straight talk has been refreshing in a political process that borders on the repulsive this election year, especially when it comes to GOP candidates, who often attack each other rather than the issues, making a mockery of the Republican Party and setting a bad example for America. Bernie s straight talk is summed up in a new song called Bernie, Bernie, Bernie, a rallying call for Bernie s supporters to continue the march toward the Democratic nomination.The lyrics in the song include the following: He s come to save democracy from the greed of the plutocracy and slay the phony narrative and make healthcare an imperative. About income inequality and media frivolity, they ll tell you you re just out of luck, while Bernie fights for 15 bucks. Perhaps the most attractive aspect about Bernie Sanders  candidacy is his ability to take stances on issues. Unlike most politicians, the senator actually has views on issues and offers solutions rather than what most politicians do, which is to avoid taking a stance for fear of losing votes.Whether Bernie Sanders is able to win the Democratic nomination or not, he s already changed America. For example, he taught other politicians that if you criticize Israel for its abhorrent treatment of the Palestinians,  you ll survive as a politician, despite the seditious influence that Israel lobby groups have over the American political system. Politicians will have to listen to voters who call for universal healthcare and an America first attitude and Bernie Sanders has been able to normalize this talk.The Bernie Sanders revolution is here.Watch the video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5a2NAfsC4I]Featured image via video screenshot.",News,"May 1, 2016"

19696,BREAKING: OBAMA APPOINTED JUDGE Demands RNC Reveal Trump’s Plans To Prevent Voter Fraud,"Just look away. The Democrats don t have any plans to steal your vote. If you don t believe us, ask this Obama appointed judge who s making it his business to make sure Republicans don t get involved protecting the sanctity of the vote for every American A federal judge is ordering the Republican National Committee to detail any agreements it has with Donald Trump s campaign to engage in  ballot security  efforts in connection with next week s election   something the national GOP has been banned from doing for decades without court approval.The order also instructs the RNC to explain by 5 p.m. Tuesday what Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway and GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence were talking about in recent comments when they said that Trump s campaign was working closely with the RNC to make sure there is no fraud at the polls. Newark, N.J.-based U.S. District Court John Vazquez issued the order Monday after the Democratic National Committee went to court last week to allege that the RNC was violating consent decrees from the 1980s settling a case alleging that GOP pollwatchers sought to intimidate minority voters in a practice then known as  caging. The agreements allow the RNC to organize poll watchers, but prohibit any effort to intimidate voters as they enter a polling place or to challenge individual voters, except as part of a program approved in advance by the court.Here s a little reminder (video below) of how the New Black Panthers intimidated voters outside of a polling place in Philadelphia. But by all means, the RNC and the Trump campaign should just look away The RNC insists it has worked to ensure compliance with the agreement and submitted to the court a series of memos sent to its personnel, national committee members and others from August through this month reminding them about the consent decree and the need to remain at arms length from all ballot security efforts. The memos tell RNC workers, officials and volunteers not to engage in poll watching efforts at all, not to take video or audio recordings at polling places and not to mention ballot fraud concerns on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.However, in August, Pence appeared to indicate there was a joint effort by the Trump campaign and the RNC to combat voter fraud.  The Trump Campaign and the Republican National Committee are working very, very closely with state governments and secretaries of state all over the country to ensure ballot integrity,  Pence said at a town hall meeting in Denver in August.In addition, Conway reportedly told the Washington Post last month that the Trump campaign is  actively working with the national committee, the official party, and campaign lawyers to monitor precincts around the country.

Remember when Obama spoke at events and those opposed to his presidency showed up armed and the president gave zero f*cks? Then remember when Donald Trump said, I Could Stand In the Middle Of Fifth Avenue And Shoot Somebody And I Wouldn t Lose Any Voters.  He probably wasn t wrong there. His supporters are unhinged but devoted. As a candidate, Trump garnered strong support from gun owners and the NRA. As a candidate, he promised to keep the Second Amendment intact. As president-elect, he just banned guns from his inauguration.Gizmodo reports:The transition team has drawn up a list of banned items. For instance, you can t bring drones, selfie sticks, or guns.

2020, WATCH: Hell Freezes As Fox News Host Calls Republican Party A ‘Disgrace’ For Being Incapable Of Governing,"Things just went from bad to worse for the Republican Party.Being in charge just isn t what Republicans imagined it would be like.After all, they have majority control of the House and Senate and have the perfect puppet in the White House to rubber stamp their destructive agenda.But millions of angry Americans across the country, including Democrats, Republicans, and independents, have made Republicans in Congress incredibly nervous about the GOP healthcare bill. Nervous enough to actually oppose it.The Trumpcare bill would strip healthcare away from 20 million Americans and cause premiums to skyrocket, both of which Donald Trump promised would not happen. In short, he lied, and many Republicans don t want to commit political suicide with him.The Republican failure to pass their terrible bill is good for the American people, but it s politically harmful to the GOP because their failure to pass their own bill despite having majority control makes them look incompetent of governing.Keep in mind that Republicans have insisted for years that they are more capable of governing the United States than Democrats. But when Americans actually put them in charge of the entire government it turns out Republicans were all talk and no walk.Rather than govern, Republicans have let Trump systematically destroy this country and now they have failed miserably in their first effort to pass a major policy on their agenda.And even Fox News is disgusted by how Republicans have performed.During his show on Fox Business on Friday, stalwart Republican cheerleader Stuart Varney literally called the entire Republican Party a  disgrace  and conceded that  they can t govern,  much to the surprise of Juan Williams. I personally believe at this moment in time, the Republican Party is a disgrace,  Varney declared.  I m serious. I am serious. We elected the Republicans to run the House, the Senate and the White House and the very, very first thing that comes up on the legislative agenda they vote no, they re split. They can t do it. They can t govern. I am really fit to be tied. Varney invited Williams to take shots at him and the GOP but he declined to do so, opting instead to point out that the Republicans who oppose this bill are doing so because it s a bad bill.Here s the video via YouTube:Indeed, the bill is not better than the Affordable Care Act. In fact, it kills all of the good things the Affordable Care Act provides and takes America back to a time when the uninsured rate was shockingly high and people had to choose between paying for healthcare or paying their bills to avoid homelessness and starvation.But Republicans only have themselves to blame what the position they are in right now. Rather than supporting a law that includes many Republican ideas such as an individual mandate, they chose to viciously oppose the law instead and demonize it for political gain. Furthermore, they had seven years to come up with a better healthcare plan and couldn t even do that. More Americans now understand that the Affordable Care Act was not the evil Republicans portrayed it to be and they now want to save it. Americans are learning about all the good things Republicans would be destroying by repealing it.And now even Fox News is having a hard time defending Republicans on this issue.

And wouldn t Germany be better off focusing their policing efforts on the over 1 million freeloaders and terrorists they ve just admitted into Germanista?Police in Germany have started carrying out raids in peoples homes in an attempt to prosecute people for inciting  hate speech  on Facebook.A press release from Germany s federal police agency confirmed that around 60 homes were searched this week as a result of people posting messages deemed as extreme by the German authorities. The action carried out today shows that the authorities are acting firmly against hate on the internet, which has grown considerably in the wake of the refugee situation,  said Holger M nch, head of the BKA, said in the statement. Attacks on refugees are often the result of radicalization, which begins on social networks. These words should not poison the social climate,  he continued.The move comes after it was revealed in January that Mark Zuckerberg had teamed up with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in order to censor people s frustrations with her migrant policy, when she decided to open up Germany s borders to millions of migrants last year.Facebook consequently introduced a policy where they agreed to remove anything deemed as  hate speech  within 24 hours.

It was difficult to tell where this talk was being held. At a school, a place of business, or a lecture hall where people paid to come see her. Either way, it was a strange sight to see a room full of people be spoken about in such a negative way without reacting in a defensive way  or reacting at all. It was also strange to see the audience members dressed in a business casual way sitting before Ashleigh who was dressed like she just got out of bed in clothing that fit way too small for her very large frame.Talks like the one given in the video are unfortunately becoming very common. Some of these so-called activists get paid to speak at corporate meetings as some sort of diversity checklist. Even white men like Tim Wise get paid lots of money to berate white people at places like Google. Much of this culture comes from the belly of the beast of liberalism which is the San Francisco bay area. Much of the tech world is run here but it is also a hotbed for radical liberalism. So when the two of those worlds mix, what you end up with is individuals like Ashleigh Shackelford allowed to run amok.

1052, The New GOP Healthcare Bill Targets Women And Plans To Defund Planned Parenthood,"The super top-secret GOP healthcare bill has been released. Hidden within all the kerfuffle is a woman s worst nightmare: Planned Parenthood losing its funding.Reported by The Hill, the Senate healthcare bill will defund Planned Parenthood for one year. The GOP bill follows the same language in the House-passed health care bill that blocks Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood.If this bill goes through, the beacon of women s health care and abortion services will be gone unless Planned Parenthood can find another viable option for funding.Of course, it s not just women that Planned Parenthood helps. They provide health care for women, men, young people, while also acting as the U.S. s largest provider of sex education. All are very crucial services.It s vital that Planned Parenthood retains its funding and we need people and our government to understand that. Thankfully, two Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski (Ala.) and Susan Collins (Maine), have already suggested they may not support the bill if it defunds Planned Parenthood, The Hill reports.Collins said Wednesday if the bill included defunding language, she and Murkowski would introduce an amendment to strip it out.Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards released a statement saying: If this is the Senate s idea of a bill with heart, then the women of America should have fear struck in theirs. Slashing Medicaid and blocking millions of women from getting preventive care at Planned Parenthood is beyond heartless. One in five women in this country rely on Planned Parenthood for care. They will not stay silent as politicians vote to take away their care and their rights. Source: The HillIs this really what many Republicans say they want? To strip women of their beacon of health and wellness?

10297,IRONY! COLLEGE “ANTI-CAPITALIST” GROUP DISBANDS Because Members Were too Rich and White,"You just can t make this stuff up! does anyone else see the HUGE irony in this?A Marxist student group at Swarthmore College disbanded itself earlier this year after realizing that its members were too rich and too white to be real commies.According to screenshots confidentially provided to Campus Reform by an individual with access to the group s private Facebook page, the demise of the Swarthmore Anti-Capitalist Collective (SACC) came in the wake of a farewell letter from a member who had decided the group could never be an effective proponent of  unproblematized anticapitalist politics  due to its  history of abuse, racism, and even classism. From my understanding SACC disbanded because they realized the makeup and tactics of their group was at odds with their espoused principles,  Swarthmore Conservative Society President Gilbert Guerra told Campus Reform.  Their main support base was middle-upper class white kids who enjoy jogging. The farewell letter corroborates Guerra s understanding, asserting that  SACC s fundamental failure  was that  at its formation, it was made up of entirely white, with the exception of one person of color*, students,  and to make matters worse,  not one of [the founding members] are from low-income and/or working class backgrounds. Arguing that  low-income people of color should never be an afterthought in a group whose politics supposedly focus on their liberation,  the author then went on to accuse SACC of having a  history of abuse, racism, and even classism that was never adequately addressed or recognized despite constantly being brought up as an issue.

In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,  Trump wrote last month.In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2016The claim has been repeatedly debunked ever since and people in both parties have criticized Trump for it.Politifact gave the claim a  Pants on Fire  rating because Trump got the information from right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones who got it from some guy who refused to provide evidence to support his claim.When Stephanopoulos interviewed Pence, he demanded to know if he thinks it s responsible for Trump to make false claims. That claim is groundless,  Stephanopoulos said.  There s no evidence to back it up. Is it responsible for a president-elect to make false statements like that? Pence pathetically defended Trump by bringing up a 2012 Pew Center study that even the study s own author says does not prove widespread voter fraud, especially the kind of voter fraud Trump is claiming.Once again, Stephanopoulos informed Pence that Trump s statement  is false. Pence continued to pretend that Trump has evidence to back up his claim and suggested that he has the right to make claim claims. I think the president-elect just wants to call to attention the fact that there has been evidence over many years,  Pence said.  It s certainly his right. It s his right to make false statements?  a bewildered Stephanopoulos asked.Pence responded by dodging the question and called Trump  refreshing  while praising his ability to brainwash people into hanging on his every word. I think one of the things that s refreshing about our president-elect. I think he made such an incredible connection with people all across this country because he tells you what s on his mind. Stephanopoulos refused to let Pence get away with not answering his question.  But why is it refreshing to make false statements?  he asked.And then the interview got testy as Pence claimed that nobody knows if Trump s statement is false or not, leading Stephanopoulos to hit Pence hard to conclude the interview.PENCE:  I don t know that is a false statement and neither do you. There is historic evidence from the Pew Research Center that voter fraud has taken place. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Can you provide any evidence to back up that statement? PENCE:  He s entitled to express his opinion on that. I think the American people find it very refreshing that they have a president who will tell them what s on his mind.

Since the beginning of February, they were some of the best performing weeks in the history of the brand,  Abigail Klem, the president of the Ivanka Trump fashion brand, tells Refinery29 in an interview published Tuesday.  For several different retailers Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the [brand s] best performance ever. The news of a sales surge comes after Nordstrom announced in early February that it would no longer carry the 35-year-old s clothing and accessories, citing poor product sales. The move caused President Trump to tweet shortly after the announcement that his daughter was being  treated so unfairly  by the luxury department store giant.Also last month, Neiman Marcus stopped carrying the first daughter s jewelry line on its website, and employees of T.J.

1056, Trump Tells His Supporters Poor People Are Too Stupid To Be In His Cabinet (VIDEO),"Alleged President Donald Trump has been on the job for only 153 days and he held another ego-rally on Wednesday. The crowd of adoring Trump fans cheered him on as he spoke down to them in a condescending manner. The former reality show star who ran on a  Drain the Swamp  platform offered an explanation in Iowa for why he has one of the wealthiest cabinets in U.S. history. The amateur president suggested that he hired billionaire private-equity investor Wilbur Ross to be his Commerce secretary because he isn t poor. Trump said,  I just don t want a poor person  in a top economics role. I love all people   rich or poor   but in those particular positions, I just don t want a poor person,  he said at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  Does that make sense? If you insist, I ll do it   but I like it better this way. That led to cheers from his supporters.CNN reports:Trump named billionaire Wilbur Ross, who has made a fortune cobbling together dying companies, as his commerce secretary, and Todd Ricketts, part of the billionaire family that owns the Chicago Cubs, as deputy commerce secretary.The Cabinet also includes billionaire Betsy DeVos as his pick for education secretary and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is a former Goldman Sachs executive. Somebody said,  Why d you appoint a rich person to be in charge of the economy,'  said Trump.  I said,  Because that s the kind of thinking we want.' They re representing the country. They don t want the money. They re representing the country. They had to give up a lot to take these jobs. They gave up a lot,  he said.Trump noted that Ross and his chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, a former Goldman Sachs president, were at the Iowa rally. That s right, Trump brought the swamp to Iowa and his supporters cheered him on. But, while on the campaign trail, Trump frequently bashed Goldman Sachs for having too much influence in politics and for paying Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for private speeches.Watch:Let s review history for a moment.It was in 1789 that George Washington, the first elected President of the U.S., tapped his former aide to be the first Secretary of the Treasury. Alexander Hamilton grew up poor and he was an immigrant from the Caribbean island of Nevis   his image is featured on our $10 bill.But, in Trump s world, Hamilton, who was an author of the Federalist Papers, would be too poor to be chosen for his administration. Trump suggested to his crowd of supporters that only rich people are smart. Those same supporters still see nothing wrong with the alleged billionaire not revealing his tax returns.According to Trump, billionaires are smart and the rest of us are dumb mother f*ckers.  Trump also raged about the media s coverage of his  presidency  during his rally.Well, we can prove that wealthy people aren t always smart or have compassion. Citation: Donald J.

22173,BIGGER THAN SNOWDEN: Wikileaks ‘Vault 7’ Classified CIA leak  – What Does It Mean?," He who controls the spice controls the universe.    Frank Herbert,  from the Dune seriesShawn Helton   21st Century WireOver the past week, much of the CIA s cyber hacking capabilities were allegedly laid bare by the Wikileaks  Vault 7  publication. According to the transparency seeking website, they ve published less than 1% of the intelligence regarding their Vault 7 series under the moniker Year Zero. All in all, the Wikileaks Vault 7 release is said to be the largest publication of classified intelligence in history. While there are still many unknowns associated with this latest CIA centered leak, there are a quite a few things to consider.Let s explore some of what we know to date and how it relates to other suspicious tech related stories over the past few years   YEAR ZERO   ZERO DAYS     Wikileaks discloses the CIA s cyber hacking capabilities   still no official comment from the intelligence agency. (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)Wikileaks  Vault 7 In 21WIRE s first report regarding the new revelations concerning Wikileaks Vault 7, we discussed how some of the content exposed in part one of Year Zero revealed what many in new media and other investigative fields have thought technologically possible for years.Here s a portion from the 21WIRE news alert mentioned above that describes the latest controversial publication by Wikileaks: WikiLeaks has released its largest ever publication of confidential documents on the Central Intelligence Agency. Entitled  Vault 7  and containing a password that echoed the alleged JFK quote  splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it into the winds,  this leak comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA s Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virginia. Year Zero , which is part one of the leak and conveniently named after a  zero day  exploit used by intelligence agencies, was gathered throughout 2016 and is said to be the  largest intelligence publication in history .Whilst a lot of the information and methodology outlined in  Year Zero  is of no surprise to security analysts and researchers since the Edward Snowden (image, left) revelations, once again the public has explicit confirmation of how one of the most powerful intelligence agencies in the world, aided by their international counterparts like GCHQ, have been infiltrating and scooping vast quantities of private information from Apple and Android devices right up to Samsung  Smart TV  technology where false  stand-by  modes and live microphones can be executed to record information and send it back to the appropriate servers. The  Year Zero  leaks a simple but cleaver play on the term zero day   something which is defined on Wikipedia as an undisclosed computer-software vulnerability that hackers can exploit to adversely affect computer programs, data, additional computers or a network. A zero day, zero hour exploit is said to leave a software author without the necessary time to correct coding or  workaround  actions of a particular hack or intrusive malware damage. (Image Source: daily express)According to Wikileaks and its editor-in-chief  Julian Assange, their most recent  treasure trove  of confidential files were obtained by a current or former CIA contractor, a story similar in scope and impact to the collection of documents dropped by former CIA/NSA contractor Edward Snowden but are said to be much larger.This time, the public has been given a glance inside the prism of the CIA s cyber hacking potential and data mining efforts similar to the NSA.In May of 2013, Snowden revealed information displaying that American citizens as well as other foreign nations throughout the world were subject to unprecedented levels of spying at the behest of the NSA. Massive data mining via XKeyScore and other similar applications proved to be very controversial particularly in America   as it seemed to be in direct contradiction to the US Constitution s 4th Amendment.Over the past decade other aspects of NSA spying activities were revealed under the George W Bush administration in 2005 and further brought to light by Mark Klein, a former AT&T technician who exposed how the multinational telecommunications company was working with the intelligence community to collect the public s data.In 2011, Gadgets and Gizmos reported the following: The recent Web 2.0 2011 conference in San Francisco saw the issue made public and now the worry is that private information could be obtained by third parties using this secretly stored data.Once the data is accessed it can even be downloaded onto an interactive map which shows where the owner of the device has been lately. So far the best way to avoid this causing a problem is to go into the settings menu and turn of the location services all together. The newly leaked Vault 7 documents identify specific cyber weapons, hacking systems, viruses and malware created by the CIA that can be used on just about anyone or any entity. This most assuredly will cause other countries to become more critical of the agency s cyber capabilities. By the looks of it, this is something that appears to be happening in Germany, as the Wikileaks docu-dump exposed an apparent CIA spy-hub in Frankfurt.Zero Hedge reports: The consulate was the focus of a German investigation into US intelligence capabilities following the 2013 revelation that NSA agents had tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel s phone.German daily  S ddeutsche Zeitung  reported the building was known to be home to a vast network of intelligence personnel including CIA agents, NSA spies, military secret service personnel, Department of Homeland Security employees and Secret Service employees. It reported the Americans had also established a dense network of outposts and shell companies in Frankfurt. Germany s reaction could prove to be more theatrical than that of true concern   only time will tell.If Vault 7 is to be accepted wholesale, it also reveals that since the 9/11 attacks the CIA has gained political and budgetary preeminence over the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA found itself building not just its now infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert, globe-spanning force   its own substantial fleet of hackers.  Part and parcel to this, Wikileaks contends that CIA hackers have developed cyber weaponry to spy on people through cell phones, computers and smart TVs.According to  Year Zero  part one of the Wikileaks Vault 7 release: The increasing sophistication of surveillance techniques has drawn comparisons with George Orwell s 1984, but  Weeping Angel , developed by the CIA s Embedded Devices Branch (EDB), which infests smart TVs, transforming them into covert microphones, is surely its most emblematic realization.The attack against Samsung smart TVs was developed in cooperation with the United Kingdom s MI5/BTSS. After infestation, Weeping Angel places the target TV in a  Fake-Off  mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on. In  Fake-Off  mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server. Interestingly, Wikileaks published a batch of classified CIA spy/hacking documents that not only include the privacy invading  Weeping Angel  developed by the clandestine agency to listen on microphones covertly but also ways the CIA has sought to remotely infect and control Microsoft Windows,  with viruses like  Hammer Drill  as well as automated infestation and control of CIA malware, such as  Assassin  and  Medusa. According to security analysts, the CIA has designed the covert methods listed above for hostile foreign actors. However, since the intelligence service has had a propensity of going rogue, these technological leaps made by the secretive agency should be a major concern to the general public.Over the past few decades there have been other spoken critics of intelligence services such as well-known journalist James Bamford and former high-ranking NSA official William Binney, both who have come forward to share the inner workings of the security world. The screenshot above from Wikileaks Vault 7 discusses CIA s techniques that can be used to frame other entities for a malware attack.Framing the Big Bear?One of the more curious details contained in Vault 7 were the revelations concerning the CIA s ability to mask any hacking  fingerprints that could potentially implicate the agency. Additionally, the secretive agency could also leave behind potential evidence that a cyber attack was carried out by a foreign body or nation. Here s another passage from the Wikileaks publication on the matter: Tradecraft DO s and DON Ts  contains CIA rules on how its malware should be written to avoid fingerprints implicating the  CIA, US government, or its witting partner companies  in  forensic review . QUESTION: Is it possible that the CIA could use its highly specialized malware to frame a foreign country for violating US national security?Zero Hedge reported the following Wikileaks information concerning the CIA s ability to bypass device encryption before it can be applied as well as mask itself from forensic review via its own entity, the Center For Cyber Inteliigence (CCI):Among the more notable disclosures which, if confirmed,  would rock the technology world , the CIA had managed to bypass encryption on popular phone and messaging services such as Signal, WhatsApp and Telegram. According to the statement from WikiLeaks, government hackers can penetrate Android phones and collect  audio and message traffic before encryption is applied. Another profound revelation is that the CIA can engage in  false flag  cyberattacks which portray Russia as the assailant. Discussing the CIA s Remote Devices Branch s UMBRAGE group, Wikileaks  source notes that it  collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques  stolen  from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation. Here s an image originally published by Wikileaks Vault 7 that displays the CIA s Center For Cyber Intelligence apparatus With claims of alleged Russian hacking at the forefront of Western intelligence, let s take another look at how that meme started Prior to the 2016 US presidential race taking place the mainstream media along with the White House, set the stage for a massive PR push implicating Russia as a disrupting force for democracy   allegedly through Kremlin-sponsored hacking of US democratic institutions and through  sophisticated Russian propaganda. In August, the western media s claims against Russia began to hit overdrive, when the  New York Times s Moscow bureau was the target of an attempted cyber attack this month. But so far, there is no evidence that the hackers, believed to be Russian, were successful. Flash forward to September here and here, as well as early October in the lead up to President Obama s Russian Hack decree, the Clinton-friendly outlet, the NY Times, had all but solidified the Russian cyber-hack claims   but once again, without any definitive evidence or proof.Throw in another American  October surprise  in the form distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, renewed calls for the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) internet, led to so-called cyber experts blaming the largest  hack on America  because of the inability to pass SOPA   in effect, reigniting the previously stalled SOPA in Washington DC, along with all of its draconian copyright law positions   all perfectly timed as mainstream reports regarding  fake news suddenly became all the rage across all forms of media.Will Vault 7 prove to shed light on other CIA related activities?The screenshot above from Wikileaks Vault 7 discusses the CIA S HIVE multi-platform software control system.DDoS AttacksIn October of 2016, I noted some of the suspicious activity surrounding America s biggest distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that was said to be caused by the malware Mirai. Given that there was a  hardcoded blacklist  of certain government entities and major multinational companies/defense contractors from being attacked   its seems more likely that the attack was US government created: Interestingly, according to Bradley Barth, a senior reporter for the IT security online magazine SC, the Mirai (supposedly leaked on September 30th) contains a very unique subset of characteristics that will not attack certain IP addresses such as the Department of Defense (DoD), the US Postal Service and consumer giant General Electric (GE) due to its coding: An Imperva analysis of the source code revealed several unique traits, including a hardcoded blacklist of IPs that the adversary did not want to attack, perhaps in order to keep a low profile. Some of these IPs belonged to the Department of Defense, the U.S. Postal Service and General Electric (GE). Though SC claims that the makers of Mirai may have been trying to keep a low profile, the recent DDoS attack attributed to the malware was as high-profile as you can get   so this begs the question, what was the real reason the malware creators put an IP blockade on the DoD, the Postal Service and GE? Is it possible that the DDoS attack originated from whitehat hackers associated with the US government, a major US defense contractor like GE or some other intelligence service, possibly the CIA?  HACKED?    Michael Hastings death sparked a wave of controversial theories. (Image source: pinterest)CIA Hacking Tools Upon closer inspection of the Wikileaks Vault 7 release, we see that in addition to the public s privacy apparently being invaded through the CIA s ability to bypass encryption on Android and iOS phones, computers and smart TVs   there was also the Wikileaks revelations exposing the agency s development of vehicular control.Wikileaks Vault 7 stated the following stunning revelation: As of October 2014 the CIA was also looking at infecting the vehicle control systems used by modern cars and trucks. The purpose of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations. It is this part of Year Zero that has revived the conspiracy surrounding the death of investigative reporter and war veteran Michael Hastings, who died after his Mercedes C250 coupe supposedly burst into a giant fireball in the early hours of June 18 2013. According to eyewitness accounts, Hastings was going at a high rate of speed as  sparks and flames  were seen before his fiery automobile crashed.The UK s Sun recently revisited the Hastings tragedy. Here s a passage of that report: Hastings   a vocal critic of government mass surveillance   had sent an email to colleagues and friends just 12 hours earlier, telling them he was onto a  big story  and was under investigation.The Buzzfeed and Rolling Stone contributor, 33, wrote: The Feds are interviewing my  close friends and associates . May be wise to immediately request legal counsel before any conversations or interviews about our news-gathering practices. I m onto a big story and need to go off the radar for a bit. WikiLeaks also tweeted after the crash to say Hastings had contacted its lawyer Jennifer Robinson just before his death, claiming the FBI was investigating him.The FBI took a  departure from normal policy  to deny that Hastings had ever been under investigation after receiving a barrage of calls about his death. The CIA has failed to confirm or deny the authenticity of the Vault 7 release, only deepening the mystery surrounding the death of Hastings.The question of CIA control over cars and trucks naturally leads us to what was revealed regarding high-tech avionics in recent years  (Photo Illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)Uninterruptible Flight ControlIn my article entitled  FLIGHT CONTROL: Boeing s  Uninterruptible Autopilot System , Drones & Remote Hijacking, I noted the CIA s involvement in certain advancements in flight technology. Lets revisit a portion of that article describing the agency s involvement: On December 4th of 2006, it was announced that Boeing had won a patent on an uninterruptible autopilot system for use in commercial aircraft. This was the first public acknowledgment by Boeing about the existence of such an autopilot system.The new autopilot patent was reported by John Croft for Flight Global, with the news piece subsequently linked by a Homeland Security News Wire and other British publications around the same time. According to the DHS release, it was disclosed that  dedicated electrical circuits  within an onboard flight system could control a plane without the need of pilots, stating that the advanced avionics would fly the aircraft remotely, independently of those operating the plane: The  uninterruptible  autopilot would be activated   either by pilots, by onboard sensors, or even remotely via radio or satellite links by government agencies like the Central Intelligence Agency, if terrorists attempt to gain control of a flight deck. Continuing, I outlined the suspicious nature of both the MH370 disaster and that of MH17. Since then there have been a number of strange airline catastrophes including Germanwings 9525 and EygptAir MS804. Following the apparent  vanishing act  of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, many investigators and researchers began to question the likelihood of such an event happening in today s high-tech world.At 21WIRE, we ve also looked into the unprecedented disappearance of MH370 and the subsequent downing of MH17, as certain details came to light regarding the history of the remote autopilot function installed within Boeing commercial airliners (a subject which also opens the door to the events of 9/11).The Boeing 777 along with other Boeing models, can in fact be flown remotely through the use of independent embedded software and satellite communication. Once this advanced system is engaged, it can disallow any pilot or potential hijacker from controlling a plane, as the rooted setup uses digital signals that communicate with air traffic control, satellite links, as well as other government entities for the remainder of a flight s journey.This technology is known as the Boeing Honeywell  Uninterruptible  Autopilot System. Has the CIA had the ability to remotely hack vehicles for much longer than we think?The Wikileaks release once again opens questions about 9/11, the deep state and what intelligence agencies have control over in the War on Terror era.  CLOAKED    What other blueprints will Wikileaks provide regarding the CIA s capabilities? (Image Source: offgraun)Public Privacy Vs. the  Deep State In an article detailing the encryption saga between Apple and the FBI, we stated that there are no guarantees in the security world, especially if a digital master-key were to be created, as this would potentially make it easier for invaders (either the government, or various hackers) mining for data moving forward into the future.If the CIA has been secretly data mining just like the NSA, they have unquestionably violated the public s constitutional rights and trust.Is this really what the CIA has been up too?In a 2016 the Guardian interviewed some of those involved in the technology and security sector. These individuals offered their thoughts regarding the government s continued encroachment on individual privacy. here s another look at that passage:Dan Kaminsky, the security expert who made his name with the discovery that one of the most basic parts of the internet, the domain name system, was vulnerable to fraud   disagrees:  Feds want final authority on engineering decisions, and their interests don t even align with fighting the vast bulk of real-world crime. Continuing, The Guardian interviewed former FBI agent Michael German, currently the Brennan Center, a judicial think-tank. The following is a part of that interview: After 9/11, you had this concept of total information awareness. The intelligence community was very enamoured of the idea that all information was available. Much like the NSA, they wanted to see it all, collect it all, and analyse it all. Western political leaders and their media arms often discuss the dangers of so-called terror sleeper cells residing in a nation near you, but none of them acknowledge or attempt to explain the historical fact that for decades, they themselves have helped to harbor, grow, foment and radicalize individuals through their own clandestine  counter-terrorism  operations.Many of these operations have directly implicated security agencies (and military alliances) such as the FBI, CIA, MI5, MI6 and NATO   in the production of real terror.While most of these counter intelligence operations have fallen under the umbrella of the so-called War On Terror era, they have also largely served to obfuscate the nature of various government programs that some critics suggest is the work of a  deep state  apparatus.QUESTION: Will there be a large public outcry regarding the lack of oversight over the CIA s spying and hacking capabilities?Watch below as 21WIRE s Patrick Henningsen discusses the  NSA-like body  of the CIA on Peter Lavelle s Cross Talk show on RT In Summary The timely release of Vault 7 comes amid a flurry of wiretapping claims from President Donald Trump, while a review of US cyber capabilities and vulnerabilities is currently underway.Additionally, the Wikileaks Vault 7 publication revealed the following stunning information concerning the scope of the CIA s cyber capabilities previously unknown to the public: By the end of 2016, the CIA s hacking division, which formally falls under the agency s Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI), had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other  weaponized  malware. Such is the scale of the CIA s undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook. The CIA had created, in effect, its  own NSA  with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified. In 2012, then CIA Director David Petraeus, mused about the emergence of an  Internet of Things    that is, wired devices   at a summit for In-Q-Tel, the CIA s venture capital firm. The Wired magazine article continued, disclosing that the future of spying hinged on smart devices and a smart home: All those new online devices are a treasure trove of data if you re a  person of interest  to the spy community. Once upon a time, spies had to place a bug in your chandelier to hear your conversation. With the rise of the  smart home,  you d be sending tagged, geolocated data that a spy agency can intercept in real time when you use the lighting app on your phone to adjust your living room s ambiance. The public has long been prepped for the surreal level of surveillance we are only just beginning to understand, whether through books, film or tech magazines or by the government itself   the warning signs of lost privacy and protection have been hidden in plain sight for decades.Even still, Wikileaks Vault 7 shocks the avid researcher, writer and pundit as it gives further insight into the CIA s multi-pronged ability to distort the perception of the public, while vacuuming up all kinds of data.*** Author Shawn Helton is Associate Editor of 21st Century Wire, as well as an independent media forensic analyst specializing in criminal investigations and media coverage from war theaters.

217," As ‘Me Too’ Posts Flood Social Media, Video Surfaces Of Trump Bragging About Hiring A ‘HOT’ Teenager","Everyone knows what a dirtbag Donald Trump is when it comes to women. His wives, his ex-wives, his mistresses, and even perfect strangers could literally all be participating in the #MeToo posts going on right now on Facebook and Twitter.The movement really took off after a tweet by actress Alyssa Milano:If you ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write  me too  as a reply to this tweet. pic.twitter.com/k2oeCiUf9n  Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) October 15, 2017Sophie Gilbert wrote an excellent piece in The Atlantic about the use of the tag to draw attention to the fact that not some, not many, but most women have had to endure some sort of sexual harassment in their everyday lives, and most of them many, many times.But in the middle of it all, another tweet came across the feeds of at least Scott Dworkin s quarter of a million followers on Twitter Monday morning. It s a recently uncovered video of Donald Trump back in 2007 giving a highly-paid speech to the Learning Annex. In it, a woman named Juliet in the audience at one point raises her hand during the Q&A portion of the event, and asks Trump, How many jets do you have and how might I apply to be a flight attendant? Seizing the opportunity to be the jackass he s been his whole life, skeevy Donald has the lovely young woman escorted to the stage. As she approaches, his face contorts into  appreciative  looks and he tells the audience,  I think she s hired, I don t know.  Leering at her body, he puts his arm around her and says, deadpan, You re hired. Trump then proceeds to tell the audience a story. I had a case, it was very interesting. A beautiful girl who was 17 or 18 and applied to be a waitress. So beautiful. She s like a world-class beauty like the young lady who just asked a question about the actress. She s so beautiful. And my people came and she said,  Mr. Trump, she has no experience.  So I interviewed her anyway because she was so pretty. And I said,  Let me ask you, do you have any experience?  She goes,  No, sir.  I say,  When can you start?' Before Juliet can leave the stage, presumably having been brought on purely as a prop for his anecdote, he squeezes her and kisses her. Then he stares at her body as she leaves the stage. This isn t my  interpretation  of what Trump is doing, you ll see in the video yourself. And as if making faces, raising his eyebrows, pursing his lips as he watches her walk away isn t enough, he turns back to the microphone and explains his  addiction  to women: See now, if she worked on my plane, that s like a death wish for me, right? That s like an alcoholic. People are alcoholics. You put Scotch in front of them, it s like [Trump waves his hands around the way he did while making fun of a disabled reporter], it s like, this would be my form of alcoholism. It is so sad that the biggest trend on social media right now is people sharing their stories of abuse publicly, just to spread awareness about how pervasive the problem is  And the country is being led by one of the biggest, most public perpetrators of that kind of abuse the world has ever known.Watch the video here:Featured image via Leon Neal/Getty Images",News,"October 16, 2017"
7801," GOP Ex-Gov Of New Jersey Attacks Christie For Endorsing Trump, Will Vote Blue If He Wins","Donald Trump is causing mass chaos within the Republican Party as infighting over endorsements reaches a fever pitch.On Friday, New Jersey governor and former Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie threw his support behind Donald Trump, in spite of repeatedly attacking him while on the campaign trail.Gov. Christie s endorsement brought New Jersey s former governor Christie Whitman out of the woodwork on Sunday. She blasted Christie s endorsement of Trump, saying if he wins the party s nomination, she will be voting for Hillary Clinton.The former governor told nj.com, I am ashamed that Christie would endorse anyone who has employed the kind of hate mongering and racism that Trump has. I would have thought being from a diverse state would have given him more awareness and compassion. Christie claimed that if Trump wins the nomination, we ll see a lot of republicans back Hillary Clinton instead.Jeb Bush staffers also blasted Christie for endorsing Trump.David Kochel, Bush s chief strategist during his now-defunct campaign for the GOP nomination, blasted Christie on Twitter.Bush s former campaign spokesman posted a whole series of Tweets blasting Christie as well:Image credit: Tim Miller via TwitterTo be fair, Chris Christie isn t the only Republican to endorse Trump.Trump s also earned the endorsement of former Arizona Governor and all around crazy person, Jan Brewer. Not surprisingly, the former governor is most excited about Trump s delusional promise to build a wall along the Mexican border, which he says will keep out all the scary brown people.Maine s governor, Paul LePage, who is currently tied with Michigan Governor Rick Snyder for worst governor in the United States, has also endorsed Donald Trump. Like Christie, LePage publicly denounced Trump last week.Trump also has been endorsed by at least two Republican members of Congress. Rep. Chris Collins of New York praised Trump s understanding of  American exceptionalism,  while Rep. Duncan Hunter of California threw his support behind the candidate only after realizing that absolutely no-one was going to vote for Mike Huckabee.Trump also has earned endorsements from former half-term governor of Alaska, Sarah Palin, and the Daily Stormer, the country s most popular Neo-Nazi website.Meanwhile, South Carolina republican Lindsey Graham blasted everyone who supports Trump, saying that he s run out of adjectives to describe  how bad I think Donald Trump is for the party and for the country. As for Trump, during an interview with Good Morning America, he said that endorsements are  a waste of time. To prove it, as Christie attempted to take the stage at a Trump rally yesterday, apparently to announce his not-so-coveted endorsement, audio captured the GOP frontrunner telling Christie to get back on the plane and go home.Watch the hilarious video here.Image credit: Michael Vadon, via wikemedia commons",News,"February 28, 2016"
9356,GOP EVIDENCE: Comey FBI Busted Giving Clinton ‘Special Status’…Those Responsible STILL At FBI! [Video],"Friday on Fox News Channel s  Fox & Friends,  Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) said evidence had been uncovered showing that the FBI gave the investigation of 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton s improper use of an unauthorized email server while secretary of state a  special status. According to the Florida Republican, who is also a member of the House Judiciary Committee, the process afforded to Clinton was different than it would have been for  any other American. We now have evidence that the FBI s investigation of Hillary Clinton did not follow normal and standard procedures,  he said.  The current deputy director of the FBI Andrew McCabe sent emails just weeks before the presidential election saying that the Hillary Clinton investigation would be special   that it would be handled by a small team at headquarters, that it would be given special status. GOETZ CALLED FOR AN IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION: I am immediately calling for an investigation into the special treatment that the FBI gave Hillary Clinton. Rep. Gaetz: ""I am immediately calling for an investigation into the special treatment that the FBI gave Hillary Clinton."" #IngrahamAngle pic.twitter.com/EHkQfyeWDK  Fox News (@FoxNews) November 22, 2017Ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee Goetz is calling for an investigation into why Hillary Clinton s FBI case was labelled  special  by the FBI s Andrew McCabe:The Hill reports:Shortly before last year s election, FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe wrote an email on his official government account stating that the Hillary Clinton email probe had been given  special  status, according to documents released Wednesday.McCabe s Oct. 23, 2016, email to press officials in the FBI said the probe was under the control of a small group of high-ranking people at the FBI s headquarters in Washington. As I now know the decision was made to investigate it at HQ with a small team,  McCabe wrote in the email. He said he had no input when the Clinton email investigation started in summer 2015, while he was serving as assistant director in charge of the FBI s Washington office. [The Washington office] provided some personnel for the effort but it was referred to as a  special  and I was not given any details about it,  he wrote.FBI officials on Wednesday night refused to answer what McCabe meant by calling the Clinton email probe a  special  or why it was restricted to a small team at headquarters when it began. We don t have anything to add to the documents that were released,  bureau spokeswoman Carol Cratty wrote The Hill.The note was contained in more than 70 pages of emails the FBI released on its public records site known as The Vault.The emails chronicled McCabe s efforts to address a separate controversy involving his wife s 2015 campaign for political office.McCabe s references to a  special  status for the Clinton probe are likely to be used as ammunition by Republican lawmakers critical of former FBI Director James Comey s handling of the Clinton investigation.Remember that the DOJ s Loretta Lynch also wanted Clinton s case to be called an  incident  and not an investigation. It looks like all intel agencies were doing all they could to protect Clinton. Was it to save themselves from exposure in the Uranium One case or something else?",politics,"Nov 25, 2017"

3448, Incoming Trump Deputy Sec. Of State Blames Russian Hacking On Obama ‘False Flag’ (VIDEO),"If you ve ever wondered if Donald Trump is completely unqualified to make any decisions about anything involving the good of our nation, ever, look no further than incoming Deputy Secretary of State John Bolton (who fills in the  Crazed Conspiracy Theorist  box on your Apocalypse BINGO cards, if you re playing). On Sunday, Bolton appeared on Fox News to let the world know to ignore the CIA s evidence that Russia actively worked to install The Donald in the Oval Office because it s all big gubmint propaganda or something  a  false flag operation,  to be exact.Yes, this is a term that we have heard applied to the Sandy Hook shooting and pretty much anything that places conservatives in the uncomfortable position of having to self-analyze their horrific positions on guns, race, gender, and other topics. The phrase was largely made popular by Trump ally Alex Jones and deceased right-wing propagandist Andrew Breitbart (Yeah, the guy conservatives think Obama had killed for knowing too much. They ve even combined this conspiracy theory with the one about Hillary Clinton having child sex slaves in some circles. But I digress) and usually virtually assures that the person who uttered the term is a f*cking idiot.Which, of course, brings us to Bolton. It s not at all clear to me just viewing this from the outside that this hacking into the DNC and the RNC computers was not a false flag operation  are words actually uttered by someone Trump just placed in a very important position. Talking Points Memo provided a pretty handy transcript of what went down:BOLTON: It s not at all clear to me just viewing this from the outside that this hacking into the DNC and the RNC computers was not a false flag operation. Let s remember what FBI director James Comey said dealing with Hillary s home brew server. He said we found no direct evidence of foreign intelligence service penetration, but given the nature of this, we didn t expect to. Meaning, a really sophisticated foreign intelligence service would not leave any cyber fingerprints. And yet people say they did leave cyber fingerprints in the hacks regarding our election. So the question that has to be asked is why did the Russians run their smart intelligence service against Hillary s server but their dumb intelligence services against the election  SHAWN: When you say false flag, that s a very serious charge. False flag by whom? Here is  The Washington post.  The Post reported the CIA has concluded individuals with close ties to the Russian government hacked the e-mails. Intelligence officials have determined that Russia s goal was to help trump win rather than simply undermine confidence in the election. Are you actually accusing someone here in this administration of trying   in the intelligence community of trying to throw something?BOLTON: We just don t know, but I believe that intelligence has been politicized in the Obama administration to a very significant degree.SHAWN: Would the intelligence officials politicize this to go so far that could damage our republic and what we have for 200-plus years stood for.BOLTON: I think the whole thing is called into question and an independent investigation becomes extremely important. I think it s critical to answer the question I posed. If you think the Russians did this, then why did they leave fingerprints?SHAWN: Maybe because we have such sophisticated and  BOLTON: James Comey and the FBI couldn t find any fingerprints  SHAWN: They use a different standard. It s been shown they have a criminal start by the CIA has more of an intellectual  BOLTON: Let s hear the debate.SHAWN: What do you want to hear? Something from the CIA director?BOLTON: I d like to know. I think we have something now. We don t want to compromise intelligence sources and methods but when you make that kind of allegation, if it were true, and the Russians have the capability and the intention of doing it, I m not by any means trying to exonerate them, but if you say they ve done that, let me be clear, either in the cyber world or elsewhere, we should retaliate. It is unacceptable for the American constitution to be assaulted by foreigners in that way. So it is absolutely critical as well that we get the facts right on this, and I don t think we have anywhere enough in the public domain to know what the facts are.SHAWN: The president has ordered a review. Senator McCain and others of the Armed Services Committee are having hearings on this with the new congress. Let me read you a statement from both Senators McCain, SenatorsGraham, Schumer, and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, both bipartisan. For years foreign adversaries have directed cyber attacks at America s physical, economic, and military infrastructure while stealing our intellectual property. Now our institutions have been targeted. Recent reports of Russian interference in our election should alarm every American. This cannot become a partisan issue. The stakes are too high for our country. McCain this morning called Putin a thug, a killer, and a murderer. The president has ordered a public review. What are you calling on the president to do before January 20th? To reveal the classified information? To bring it all out so Americans can know if Russia had a hand in this election?BOLTON: One thing that makes me very nervous is Barack Obama saying let s have this report before the 20th of January so I can wrap it up. I think the burden for well or ill is going to fall on Mike Pompeo who has been named as president-elect trump s cia director. I think he s trusted by republicans and democrats. He doesn t bring any baggage. He s a new official at the CIA. I d look to him to head up an investigation across the entire intelligence committee. I just think these are such serious charges, again, if the Russians or any other foreign government think that they can undermine the integrity of our elections or defeat our constitutional process, this is just as serious an attack as a military attack.SHAWN: For those who are bothered by your claim of a potential false flag, that s very disturbing as an American.BOLTON: We would want to know who else might want to influence the election and why they would leave fingerprints that point to the Russians. That s why I say until we know more about how the insurance   intelligence community came to this conclusion  While he didn t say definitively that he believed this to be a  false flag,  Bolton made it clear that he might-or-might-not believe that President Obama   whose administration has a history of politicizing intelligence  to a very significant degree,  wink, wink   might or might not have told the CIA to falsely claim that Russia helped Donald Trump get elected because reasons. Makes perfect sense.Watch the interview below:Featured image via screengrab",News,"December 12, 2016"
16010,MEDALS OF VALOR: President Trump Honored Agents and Officers Who Took Down Gunman at GOP Baseball Practice Shooting [Video],"It s great to have a president who appreciates our special agents and police officers! Trump honored the police officers and special agents who took down the lunatic who shot Steve Scalise last month during a baseball practice for a charity game:Remember the horrible day that the lunatic opened fire trying to kill Republicans?Here s our report on the shooting:Rep. Steve Scalise was shot Wednesday morning in Alexandria, Virginia, in a  deliberate attack.  A congressional staffer was also shot. Scalise is in surgery right now and is expected to recover.Rand Paul said Scalise being there likely saved everyone because his presence meant Capitol Police were there.Scalise, a member of the House Republican leadership as the majority whip, appeared to have been shot in the hip and it appeared two Capitol Hill police agents were shot, according to Rep. Mo Brooks who was on deck when the shooting occurred. The shooting took place at a practice for the GOP congressional baseball team.NBC News Special Report: Congressman Scalise, aides shot at baseball practice in Virginia https://t.co/KD9i1iP9MZ  Jason Calabretta (@JasonCalabretta) June 14, 2017In a statement, Texas Rep. Roger Williams, one of the team s coaches, said one of his staff members was shot during the incident and is receiving medical attention. There was no information on the staffer s injuries.According to both congressional and law enforcement sources, the shooting appears to be a  deliberate attack. Two law enforcement sources say the suspect  is in police custody, has been taken to a hospital.Lawmakers who spoke at the scene to reporters described a normal morning practice, at a field where they ve practiced for years, when all of a sudden shots rang out. Lawmakers, staff members and even the young son of one of the members ran for cover, jumping into dugouts and over fences to avoid the gunshots.Congressmen in attendance described  an injured Scalise dragging himself roughly 15 yards away from second base and lying there until the shooter was shot. The Congressmen then ran to help him. Once they were able, Sen. Jeff Flake said he and Rep. Brad Wenstrup, who is a physician, went out to where Scalise was lying to apply pressure to the wound. Nobody would have survived without the Capitol Hill police. It would have been a massacre without them.  -Rand Paul  We had nothing but baseball bats to fight back against a rifle with.    Congressman Mo BrooksArizona Sen. Jeff Flake added that he saw a member of Scalise s security detail return fire on the gunman for what felt like 10 minutes, even though the police officer was wounded in the leg.  50 shots would be an understatement, I m quite sure,  Flake said when asked about the total amount of gunfire, including police returning fire. Flake said two members of Scalise s security detail were wounded, and another man was wounded in the chest. Brooks said the shooter appeared to be a white male but added that  I saw him for a second or two.  He said the shooter was behind the third base dugout and didn t say anything.  The gun was a semiautomatic,  Brooks said, adding that he was sure it was a rifle but unsure what kind.  It continued to fire at different people. You can imagine, all the people on the field scatter. It s come to this How will we bring America together if the Democrats keep fanning the flames of division?Read More: FOX News",Government News,"Jul 27, 2017"

1131, WATCH: Hilarious Leaked Video Shows Australian PM Mocking Trump And It’s Now The Best Thing On The Internet,"During a private speech to journalists, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull let his inner comedian shine with a hilarious impersonation of Donald Trump. Not only does he nail the dialogue, he perfectly executes the portrayal down to Donald s awkward and childlike arrogance. The Donald and I, we are winning and winning in the polls,  he said Wednesday in a leaked video.  We are winning so much, we are winning, we are winning like we have never won before. The Journalists in attendance had agreed not to report or share the brilliant mockery they witnessed that night, but an editor from Nine Network couldn t help but share this gem with the world. I have this Russian guy.   Believe me, it s true, it is true,  added Turnbull, alluding to the Russian scandal playing out in the White House.In the wake of the backlash from the leaked video, Turnbull told Melbourne Talk Radio that his mockery was a light-hearted jest and a  good-humored roast.  He thinks people should  lighten up  about it.You can pretty much guarantee Trump won t be  lightening up  about this genius comedy act making fun of him in the best way possible. When respected world leaders are trying their hand at stand-up comedy to make fun of Trump, he s probably not going to take it lightly.Check out this amazing piece of comedy that is sure to go down in history as one of the great Trump portrayals:Featured image via screen capture",News,"June 15, 2017"
10217,MAXINE WATERS Gleefully Reveals Plan to Destroy Trump in Disturbing Interview [Video],"Rep. Maxine Waters said today that if Robert Mueller  does his job  and is able to prove collusion between President Donald Trump s campaign and the Russians, then  we ve got him. In an interview with MSNBC host and self-professed Waters fan Joy Reid, Waters reiterated that Democrats needed to work to remove Trump from office. Reid asked Waters if she had a sense that more Republicans in Congress were willing to  stand up  to Trump.Waters said she felt some Republicans did not know how to handle the situation or were simply waiting for the president to  implode. Many of them are not comfortable, and I believe that if Mueller does his job, if he s able to connect the dots, if he s able to show collusion, then we ve got him,  she said.  They will move away from him. Waters, a darling of progressives due to her constant calls for Trump s impeachment, has previously likened Mueller s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election to a contest of sorts. In an appearance Friday on MSNBC, she said Mueller is  going to win. Trump has consistently stated the Mueller probe is a  witch hunt  and pointed to the partisanship of the investigators on his team, although other Republicans have said Mueller s reputation is unquestioned.On  The View  last week, Waters said she welcomed the leaks coming from Trump s White House and was  so glad they re telling us what s going on.

9240,"BREAKING NEWS: Woman Who Narrated BRUTAL TORTURE, Scalping of Mentally Disabled Young Man On Live Facebook Video Gets DISTURBING Sentence","When four Chicago thugs videotaped the brutal tortured a young mentally disabled man they kidnapped in a live Facebook video, Americans were stunned. Almost immediately after the discovery was made, the spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department called it a  stupid mistake .The superintendent of the building where the torture took place, shrugged off the horrific event by simply saying,  Kids make stupid mistakes. It looks like not much has changed in the attitudes of Chicago officials tasked with holding criminals accountable, especially in the case of four repulsive young thugs, who scalped the young 18-year old man, made him drink from a toilet, forced him to yell,  F*ck Trump  and  F*ck white people , and repeatedly hit him while his hands were tied and his mouth was covered with duct tape.The video is hard to watch but is an honest look at the anti-Trump and racist monsters who ve been given a pass by our media. Go HERE to watch the disturbing video. (***Warning***the video is very graphic).It was just announced that in a plea deal, Brittany Covington, 19, the narrator of the video, who had been held at the Cook County Jail without bond since January, will be the first of the four to be released. In a shocking case of injustice, the plea deal states that Covington will remain on probation for four years and is barred from contact with 2 of the other 3 co-criminals, Cooper and Hill, the Chicago Sun-Times is reporting.Other terms of the plea agreement bars Covington from using social media for four years, the Cook County State s Attorney s Office tells CBS 2.Brittany Covington narrated Facebook Live video of the others tormenting an 18-year-old white man in the apartment she shared with her sister.The victim, a Crystal Lake man who had been classmates with Hill at a west suburban alternative high school, appears terror-stricken as he was taunted with racially-tinged insults   including calling him a supporter of then-President-elect Donald Trump. Hill and Cooper allegedly cut his clothing with a knife, punched and kicked him. In another video, the man was forced to drink water from a toilet bowl.In one of the videos the defendants allegedly posted on Facebook, a man threatened the victim with a knife. Someone told the victim,  kiss the floor, b -!  and  nobody can help you anymore.  At one point, someone told the victim,  say  I love black people.   When a woman who lived in the building complained about the the noise and threatened to call the police, the sisters kicked in the woman s door in anger and took some of her property, police said. While the others had run to the other apartment, the victim managed to escape, and police found him, wearing shorts and his torn clothing in the January weather, a block away. Streamwood police officials say the victim s parents had made a missing-persons report after their son didn t return home.During the Streamwood police investigation, the victim s parents started  receiving text messages from persons claiming to be holding him captive,  officials said.Plea negotiations are ongoing with her three co-defendants, all of whom also have been in custody.

4774, Detroit Mayor Blasts Trump’s ‘Phony’ Black Church Visit,"Donald Trump, knowing that his poll numbers with black voters are abysmal, decided to spend part of his Saturday at a black church, Detroit s Great Faith International Ministries. However, it could not be more clear that he was in no way wanted there. Firstly, protesters showed up in throngs to condemn his visit, and then, the Democratic mayor, Mike Duggan, held a press conference slamming Trump s presence in his city. Duggan said: I feel like I m watching the next season of  The Apprentice.' This is the most phony major party nominee that I ve seen in my lifetime, and that s why we re skeptical. Trump s visit included a conversation with the church s Bishop, Wayne Jackson, and remarks to the congregation about how he supposedly will help African Americans (or perhaps just his way of saying how much he loves  the blacks ). Duggan, however, saw through the charade, and said of Trump s pandering: Are you here just to use Detroiters as props in a re-imaging campaign, or are you here to have a real conversation where you re finally going to give us the specifics on what you re going to do to make American cities better? Another local Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Brenda Lawrence, joined Duggan in his condemnation of Trump. She made a point of reminding everyone of the insulting language Trump uses when speaking of African Americans in his so-called  outreach.  Rep. Lawrence said: He said when he sees an African American that I am broke, I am unemployed, I m uneducated, and whenever I walk out my door I m being shot. What do I have to lose?  I don t want my grandchild to listen to the rhetoric that she, as a woman and as an African-American, is classified and stereotyped as uneducated. Of course, both Duggan and Lawrence are right. Trump is absolutely clueless. This visit, like all of his other events that are done anywhere except in front of all white audience where he s shouting about minorities and dog whistling racists, is nothing more than a photo-op, a way to gain a few votes from the gullible, and most importantly to make sure that suburban white America thinks he is just not racist enough for them to be able to vote for him with a clear conscience.Featured image via Aaron P.

9084,JUST IN: CROOKED DOJ OFFICIAL Didn’t Reveal That His Wife Was Being Paid By Fusion GPS to Get Dirt on Trump [Video],"We ve been covering the curious case of DOJ official Bruce Ohr and his wife Nellie Ohr What they did is so corrupt and underhanded! Nellie worked for the opposition research firm hired by the Democrats to get dirt on Trump (see below). Her husband would take whatever Nellie produced about Trump and hand it over to the FBI! Unreal! This should be jail time because of the omission of the conflict of interest being an ethics violation. So far, it appears as though Bruce Ohr has just been demoted.NOW WE FIND OUT THAT BRUCE OHR HID THE FUSION GPS PAYMENTS TO HIS WIFE:Daily Caller reports:Bruce Ohr, the Department of Justice official who brought opposition research on President Donald Trump to the FBI, did not disclose that Fusion GPS, which performed that research at the Democratic National Committee s behest, was paying his wife, and did not obtain a conflict of interest waiver from his superiors at the Justice Department, documents obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation show.The omission may explain why Ohr was demoted from his post as associate deputy attorney general after the relationship between Fusion GPS and his wife emerged and Fusion founder Glenn Simpson acknowledged meeting with Ohr. Willfully falsifying government ethics forms can carry a penalty of jail time, if convicted.The Democratic National Committee (DNC) hired Fusion GPS to gather and disseminate damning info about Trump, and they in turn paid Nellie Ohr, a former CIA employee with expertise in Russia, for an unknown role related to the  dossier.  Bruce Ohr then brought the information to the FBI, kicking off a probe and a media firestorm.The DOJ used it to obtain a warrant to wiretap a Trump adviser, but didn t disclose to the judge that the DNC and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s campaign had funded the research and that Ohr had a financial relationship with the firm that performed it   which could be, it turns out, because Ohr doesn t appear to have told his supervisors. Some have suggested that the financial payments motivated Bruce Ohr to actively push the case.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON NELLIE OHR:This is a big deal even though we re sure the main stream media will ignore it.

1398, Paul Krugman Shares The One Damning Truth About Corrupt Republicans We Can All Agree On (DETAILS),"The amount of corruption we have seen in Donald Trump s rise and presidency has been alarming, and it s not going to stop anytime soon.Even after suspiciously firing his FBI Director during an explosive investigation and having several high profile personal lawsuits, scandals and conflicts of interest, the Republican Party still has yet to hold Trump accountable for his faults. Whenever the GOP has had a chance to distance itself from Trump and do the right thing, spineless Republicans have failed to stand up and put their country first.In a Friday column in The New York Times, columnist Paul Krugman brilliantly pointed out the Republican Party s failing during Trump s presidency. Krugman states that today s GOP has become more about tax cuts for the rich than anything else, and conservatives will defend it at all costs. Arguing that Republicans no longer care about their country or its Constitution, Krugman wrote: This structure rewards, indeed insists on, absolute fealty. What this means is that nearly all Republicans in today s Congress are apparatchiks, political creatures with no higher principle beyond party loyalty. We ve certainly seen this play out in the way that Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and other prominent Republicans refuse to hold erratic Trump accountable even as his scandals and behavior put the country at risk. But even if Trump were to be impeached, Krugman warns,  the threat to the Republic will be far from over.  Krugman states that Trump s idiocy may have actually helped the country stay away from more sinister Republican values: In a perverse way, we should count ourselves lucky that Trump is as terrible as he is. The point is that given the character of the Republican Party, we d be well on the way to autocracy if the man in the White House had even slightly more self-control. Trump may have done himself in; but it can still happen here. We hate to say it, but he s probably right.Featured image via Mark Wilson / Getty Images",News,"May 20, 2017"
7339," Adele Brings Whole Crowd Together To Dedicate Song To Brussels, And It’s Breathtaking (VIDEO)","When there are those who are injured and killed in terror attacks, there will also be those who stand behind them in solidarity to show their unending love and support. No greater example of this was exhibited than on Tuesday night in London s O2 arena when Adele dedicated a song to the city of Brussels, Belgium and got the entire crowd to sing along with her.Brussels is the latest city to feel the sting of those who see harming others as a means to be heard and get their way. These terrorists are cruel, yet unfortunately, no longer unusual. Too many of these attacks are occurring and there needs to be a united effort to stop the spread of terror across the globe.One way to show these inhumane monsters that their terror will not affect life as we know it, is by sticking together in times of need and moving forward with a bond that is greater than anything hatred can foster. By dedicating her song  Make You Feel My Love  to the city of Brussels and having the entire arena sing along while waving light proves that age-old saying from Martin Luther King, Jr.: Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that. And this is, by far, one of the most perfect examples of such light and love.

She hasn t cared about the Middle Class in 70 years. She s starting now???? I support women! That includes the unborn in the womb. I won t support anyone that supports Planned Parenthood. When terrorists murdered a US ambassador and 3 other Americans, her response was,  What difference does it make? She takes money from countries that execute homosexuals and oppress women. She couldn t satisfy her husband how is she going to satisfy a whole country? Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, Sean Smith, Tyrone Woods, and Glen Doherty. Because she s morally bankrupt! Judge Jeanine: Hillary Clinton is only out for herself. She is the poster child for what s wrong with our government. She is a criminal. She is a liar. She has accomplished nothing. I don t believe in socialism. The left believes in the supremacy of govt over the individual. Do you want tyranny or liberty? I don t believe in political dynasties. Because God must be ignored to adopt her   Ends Justifies the Means   ideology. She is Bill and Obama but without the charm. Enough is too much already. Corruption, incompetence, dishonesty, elitism  just a few reasons. As a Hispanic, black woman I feel insulted by Dems who feel my needs are only abortion, immigration and racism. Because her greatest accomplishment has been accomplishing nothing worthy of our votes. I ve taken European History. I know the dangers of a socialist leader. Because she s worse than Caligula.

15846,BREAKING: WHY DID MASSACHUSETTS OFFICIALS WAIT SO LONG To Release This Video Showing Thug Shooting Police Officer In Face? [VIDEO],"Where was the media coverage when this black thug shot a white police officer in the face? It clearly doesn t fit their narrative which explains why this horrific incident took place on March 27, 2015 and the video is just being released today Massachusetts officials on Friday released video footage showing the near-fatal shooting of a Boston police officer last month by a man who was subsequently shot dead by other officers.The decision to release the footage comes amid protests in several major U.S. cities over a series of killings of civilians in recent months. The latest occurred last Saturday when a white officer in South Carolina was videotaped shooting an unarmed black man as he fled after a traffic stop. It is in everyone s best interest to share (this) information as soon as possible in order to tamp down speculation and rumors meant to inflame and not inform,  Suffolk District Attorney Daniel F. Conley said at a news conference.The video shows six-year Boston Police Department veteran John Moynihan and two colleagues approaching a car stopped at about 6:40 p.m. on March 27 in Boston s Roxbury neighborhood.As Moynihan stands near the driver s door, a man identified by police as 41-year-old Angelo West jumps out of the vehicle, shoots Moynihan in the face and runs out of the camera frame as Moynihan falls to the ground.Authorities say West, who had a criminal record including prior gun charges, was shooting at police as he ran and that Moynihan s fellow officers returned fire, killing him.Moynihan, 34, is recovering after surgery to remove a bullet lodged in his neck.Local leaders at the news conference said that anger toward police over the incident was minimal. We need to be very aware that the work of police officers is indeed very dangerous,  said Rev. Mark Scott, of the Azusa Christian Community in Boston s Dorchester neighborhood.He called West s death  tragic,  but added that once someone pulls a gun on a police officer,  you don t leave the police any other option but to respond.

21975,Santilli Freed Under Plea Pact as Vegas Shooting Casts Shadow on Bundy Trial," LONG SHADOW: The wake of the recent mass tragedy in Las Vegas has overtaken various current events, including the Bundy Trial (Image: Mandalay Bay Hotel & Resort) By Mark Anderson The TRUTH HOUNDLAS VEGAS Although the ongoing Bundy trial in the U.S. District Court in Las Vegas, Nevada has had its share of dramatic changes, that s especially true lately.A major twist is that internet-radio personality Pete Santilli   one of seven defendants in the trial that had been set to begin with jury selection on Oct. 10th before it was delayed again  plead guilty (on Friday, Oct. 6) and was released pending sentencing,  confirmed his attorney, Chris Rasmussen of Las Vegas.Rancher Cliven Bundy held without trial for over 18 months.In that highly anticipated trial, with Santilli now excluded due to his plea, the federal government is trying elder rancher Cliven Bundy (image, left), his sons Ammon and Ryan, and  militia leader  Ryan Payne. Two other defendants, O. Scott Drexler and Eric Parker, who are being retried for a third time from earlier proceedings will join the others in this second of three planned trials.Another development affecting the trial is concern that the Oct. 1st mass shooting at Mandalay Bay Hotel might prevent the defendants from getting a fair shake. According to Ryan Payne s attorney, the Vegas shooting has the potential to bias jurors, and has asked that the trial be moved to Nevada s second largest city, Reno, located seven hours north of Las Vegas.But while moving the proceedings 450 miles away to Reno s federal court appears unlikely as of this writing, the Las Vegas federal court issued yet another delay in this complicated trial. Therefore, the previously announced Oct. 10 date for jury selection for the second trial will be changed to on, or around, Oct. 30th.And even that could be subject to change again, given the already bumpy track record of this multiple-defendant case   in which the federal government has had a hard time making its allegations stick.Only Gregory Burleson, who s wheelchair-bound and reportedly has developed blindness, has been sentenced   to 68 years, no less. He was convicted in the first trial that began in early February. A co-defendant in that trial, Todd Engel, is expected to be sentenced Dec. 22, though several other defendants have been cleared of numerous charges.SANTILLI S JOURNEYSantilli, who shot extended livestream video footage at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge building near Burns, Oregon, was held on remand for his role in that latter-2015, early-2016 affair.The controversial internet radio personality has had his share of critics, both in and out of the court room. Some critics alleged that his some of the  journalistic  coverage shot in Oregon enabled the government to more closely monitor the Bundys and their supporters who had peacefully occupied the abandoned building to protest onerous federal land controls and the unlawful arrest of the Hammonds, local ranchers who had fallen foul of federal agents from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Others, however, felt his coverage would have provided a helpful account of events had federal agents decided to take the building by force. During the Oregon hearings, his defense attorney argued that much footage which he had broadcast on his YouTube channel should be considered as protected speech under the First Amendment.On the eve of last September s Oregon trial   Santilli had all charges dismissed against him.Although later cleared of Oregon-related charges, Santilli remained in federal custody and was transferred to Nevada to stand trial for his role in the famous spring 2014  standoff  at Bundy Ranch in Bunkerville, Nevada   an event that saw Cliven Bundy, his sons and other supporters gather to protest the policies of the BLM and other  agencies.Federal agents unsuccessfully attempted to confiscate Cliven s cattle over alleged claims that he owed significant federal grazing fees, and concerning a EPA court order over a contested environmental mitigation policy concerned the relocation of the Desert Tortoise. From the onset of the controversy, Cliven Bundy has maintained the federal government lacks jurisdiction in that part of southern Nevada and that the fees don t apply, citing legal and historical matters.Santilli: released before the trial.In Nevada, Santilli pleaded guilty to Count 2   a single felony count of obstruction of justice, based on the government s claim that he used his own vehicle to impede the movement of an approaching BLM convoy during the attempted cattle impoundment. Interestingly, during that incident, after the convoy stopped, federal agents and their guard dogs were then confronted by members of the Bundy family and their supporters. Santilli then filmed the altercation   including federal agents tasering Ammon Bundy, and posted it on YouTube, which went instantly viral, garnering nearly 1.5 million views in just a few days. The video was then syndicated on FOX News and other national outlets. Many had credited Santilli s original video entitled,  Ranch Riot as one of the key catalysts for the one thousand or so supporters and militia who then arrived at Bundy Ranch over the following 72 hours before the standoff on April 12, 2014.Like all the other defendants, he was initially charged with all 16 counts contained in the original federal complaint   which carried a potential maximum sentence of life in prison, upon conviction for all or most of those counts.Interestingly, Santilli s attorney, Mr. Rasmussen, motioned in court, and later told this writer, that the government may consider the prison time that Santilli has already served   behind bars since Jan. 26, 2016   as either sufficient punishment for that felony charge in a best-case scenario, or the court may at least consider giving him credit for that time served, even if he s given a longer sentence at his expected sentencing hearing on Jan. 11, 2018 at 8 a.m.PLEA BARGAIN DETAILSA reading of the plea agreement shows that the government reserves the right to impose a longer prison term, possibly six years, on Santilli.Also, Rasmussen noted that residing Judge Gloria Navarro is not bound by the agreement s recommendations, meaning she could choose to alter them when she sentences Santilli.Meanwhile, two pending defense motions   one to exclude Oregon-related evidence in the government s Nevada case against Santilli, and another to challenge the government s claim that Santilli could not excuse his Nevada actions because of his journalistic background   have become moot due to this plea bargain, Rasmussen added.The agreement s terms may raise the question of whether the other defendants  actions will be seen in a more negative light, given the fact that Santilli s guilty plea to the felony-obstruction charge requires   under penalty of perjury   that he accept the following government-sourced narrative as  true and correct. The maximum penalty for  Conspiracy to Impede or Injure a Federal Officer,  as this count against Santilli is formally named under 18 U.S.C.  372, is six years imprisonment, a fine of $250,000, or both.But in the shifting sands of these proceedings, the understanding at this juncture is that Santilli will owe neither a fine nor restitution, nor will there be forfeiture of his assets   provided he meets the terms of his release until he s sentenced. Although according to Rasmussen, Santilli will not be electronically monitored, despite speculation that he would be tagged.RETURNING TO INTERNET RADIONotably, Santilli, who is expected to return to his hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio, during the week starting Monday Oct. 16, will reportedly be allowed, at least for the time being, to resume broadcasting his news content.Asked if Santilli would be able to comment on the Bundy trial itself, Rasmussen replied in writing:  He can do whatever he wants as long as he s not committing crimes.  The First Amendment allows him to comment on anything unless it is threatening or inciting violence. Furthermore, attorney Rasmussen said that Santilli is under a  self-imposed  gag order, not a government-imposed one, meaning he has chosen not to talk to reporters.Also, Santilli will not testify against the other defendants and will not have to turn over his journalistic  work products,  but only  raw discovery  information from court proceedings. And the plea bargain stresses he must remain crime-free regarding federal, state and local laws and among other things must avoid any known association with anyone who s breaking any law. The plea agreement also restricts him from significant travel   initially only between southern Nevada and Cincinnati, Ohio.Nor can Santilli possess a gun or any other item deemed by the government as a weapon. Just failing to show up for a hearing or some other procedural matter, let alone larger infractions, could result in this deal being dissolved.STAY TUNED FOR MORE UPDATESREAD MORE BUNDY RANCH NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Bundy Ranch FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE  SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV",US_News,"October 14, 2017"
7682, Why The Secret Service Is Investigating Glenn Beck (VIDEO),"The United States Secret Service is investigating conspiracy theorist and right wing radio host Glenn Beck. The probe is in relation to a statement Beck made on his nationally syndicated radio show while broadcasting from the CPAC conference.The agency is required to investigate any and all threats related to the people it is protecting, in this case it happens to be comments Beck made about Donald Trump, who Beck is opposed to. From CBS Dallas:During his radio show Friday morning, Beck and his producers were talking about the other candidates saying they would support Donald Trump if he becomes the Republican nominee.His producer mocked Beck after Beck mentioned being in the shoes of Trump s rivals: Was it gigantic shoes?  asked the producer Stu Burguiere. If I was close enough and I had a knife. Really. I mean the stabbing just wouldn t stop,  Beck responded, appearing to direct his comments at Burguiere.Beck s comments were blasted out by the conservative Daily Caller, which is run by Fox News host Tucker Carlson.But unlike so many other inflammatory statements from Beck, this may actually be a mistake. Beck was apparently talking about his producer, Stu Burguiere. Burguiere posted on his Facebook page after the incident noting,  If you were listening, you know that Glenn actually threatened me, not Donald Trump, so I am in the odd situation of defending my boss for threatening my life. The comments may have been seen as more credible because Beck has been a critic of Trump, claiming that his preferred candidate, Ted Cruz, is more qualified and destined for the presidency than Trump. Beck has accused Trump of being a huckster and a phony.It seems fitting that a conservative media outlet s sloppy reporting led to federal law enforcement being called in on another conservative media icon.Beck has for years promoted conspiracy theories about President Obama, Democrats, and other progressives. He also claimed that Obama hates white people and that he has been using the power of the government to give black people reparations. Beck s theories were so out there that advertisers began abandoning his afternoon show on Fox News, and the network soon dropped him. Now he broadcasts online and on a few niche cable networks, while still retaining his radio show   but even that is dwarfed by more successful hosts like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity.Featured image via Flickr",News,"March 5, 2016"
18009,N KOREA JUST REVEALED Plans To Unleash An Unimaginable  Attack That Could Lead To Electronic Armageddon,"WFB  North Korea for the first time this week revealed plans for using its nuclear arms for space-based electronics-disrupting EMP attacks, in addition to direct warhead ground blasts.The official communist party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, published a report Monday on  the EMP might of nuclear weapons,  outlining an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack produced by detonating a nuclear warhead in space. In general, the strong electromagnetic pulse generated from nuclear bomb explosions between 30 kilometers and 100 kilometers [18.6 miles and 62 miles] above the ground can severely impair electronic devices, electric machines, and electromagnetic grids, or destroy electric cables and safety devices,  said the article authored by Kim Songwon, dean of Kim Chaek University of Technology in Pyongyang. The discovery of the electromagnetic pulse as a source of high yield in the high-altitude nuclear explosion test process has given it recognition as an important strike method,  he stated.The official discussion by North Korea of plans to conduct EMP strikes will likely fuel debate over the threat. Former CIA Director James Woolsey has said North Korea is capable of orbiting an EMP nuclear weapon in a satellite.Some liberal arms control advocates have dismissed the EMP threat from Pyongyang as far-fetched, such as arms control advocate Jeffrey Lewis, who in April dismissed the threat of an EMP attack by laughing at a reporter s question.  This is the favorite nightmare scenario of a small group of very dedicated people,  he told NPR.Disclosure of North Korea s intention to use its nuclear force for EMP attacks comes as U.S. intelligence agencies are continuing to analyze the latest underground nuclear test by North Korea on Sept. 3 that the regime said was its first hydrogen bomb explosion.Senior administration officials said initial assessments of the nuclear blast in northeastern North Korea indicate it was the largest test detonation so far, and much larger than an underground test carried out last year. It was the regime s sixth nuclear test.U.S. nuclear technicians have not made a definitive conclusion about the specifics of the device. Specialists are trying to determine if the test involved a hydrogen bomb, as Pyongyang asserted, or a device designed for EMP attack. They are also assessing whether the test used boosted fission technology.Hydrogen bombs are advanced devices that use a two-stage explosion process to produce a massive explosion. Boosted fission devices are less sophisticated technologically and require more nuclear fuel. We re highly confident this was a test of an advanced nuclear device and what we ve seen so far is not inconsistent with North Korea s claims,  a U.S. intelligence official said.However, a final conclusion on the type and yield of the blast is not expected for several days. Data from the test is being analyzed by nuclear weapons experts at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.Also, the large explosion perhaps more than 100 kilotons, or the equivalent of 100 tons of TN likely produced significant venting of radioactive particles into the air.Special U.S. intelligence aircraft, including the WC-135 nuclear  sniffer  jets, are conducting flights near the test zone to gather samples of particles from the test.EXPERTS ARE SAYING AN EMP ATTACK BY N KOREA IS A VERY REAL AND DARK POSSIBILITYAccording to the Business Insider, some experts believe that the more realistic threat at this point in time is an EMP attack. To make that happen, all North Korea has to do is launch a low-yield nuclear missile from a submarine, ship, or even by balloon and explode it at high altitude, above the atmosphere.The potential result: a blackout of the Eastern grid that supplies 75% of power to the United States.If an EMP attack did take place, it would be beyond anything we have seen before. The Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse Attack, which was established by Congress in 2001, estimates that within 12 months following a nationwide blackout,  up to 90% of the US population could perish from starvation, disease, and societal breakdown. Electronic ArmageddonIn practical terms, a catastrophic blackout would be worst in cities, because it would instantly deprive the population of access to drinking water, refrigeration, heat, air conditioning, and telecommunication. Food stores would be looted within a matter of days, and gas stations would cease to function without electricity.Without Internet access and power, all commerce and advanced methods of communication would stop. There would be no TV, radio, phones. Credit card transactions and cash withdrawals at banks would be impossible. Paper money would become worthless, and Bitcoin would cease to exist, along with the stock market.Newt Gingrich, speaking at the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources earlier this month, said an EMP attack  would send us back to the 18th century. But that s not the only problem. If no outside help arrives, within days, chaos begins to reign. Civilization is a rather thin veneer that humans have acquired over centuries, a mask covering our hard-wired survival instincts. Once the mask slips, it could mean the end of the world as we know it.We are Ill-Prepared For An EMP AttackUS politicians and major utilities have kicked the can down the road when it comes to EMP preparation. Edison Electric estimates that shielding transformers for the US grid system could cost $20 billion.Granted, American power companies have been studying ways to protect our electronic grids against attack, but tangible results are slow in coming.The only current option after an EMP attack would be to replace damaged or destroyed transformers. However, says Scott Aaronson, managing director for Cyber and Infrastructure Security at Edison Electric, replacements for those transformers must be procured from foreign suppliers, which could take up to 18 months.Peter Vincent Pry, leader of the Task Force on National and Homeland Security, believes North Korea is closer to launching an EMP attack than many analysts believe. He wants Congress to work harder and cut the red tape to allow the innovation necessary to mitigate the threat.In Pry s opinion, an EMP attack would ultimately kill more Americans than a direct nuclear blast could. His book, The Long Sunday, describes several plausible EMP attack scenarios.Pry thinks that  the first nation to use nuclear weapons today even a rogue state like North Korea or Iran will immediately become the most feared and credible nuclear power in the world, a formidable force to be reckoned with, and perhaps the dominant actor in a new world order. Is there a sensible way to prepare for an EMP attack?Maybe not, but stocking some food, water, fuel, and batteries for emergencies is always a good idea as well as owning a stash of gold coins as hard assets.While  you can t eat gold,  as some preppers say, it is the only kind of money that has prevailed over the millennia. Kim, the North Korean technical university dean, stated that high-altitude explosions can be conducted in the stratosphere or in space where the blast wave is limited by the lack of air or the thinness of air. In explosions occurring at such altitudes, large amounts of electrons are released as a result of ionization reactions of high-energy instant gamma rays and other radioactive rays,  he said.  These electrons form a strong electromagnetic pulse (EMP) through interaction with the geomagnetic field. The detonation would create a strong electric field of 100,000 volts per meter when it approaches the ground and  that is how it destroys communications facilities and electricity grids,  the report said.The EMP report was published Monday, a day after the same state-run outlet reported on a visit by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to a nuclear weapons facility that also mentioned plans for using nuclear weapons in EMP attacks. Our hydrogen bomb whose power as a nuclear bomb can be adjusted at will from tens of kilotons to hundreds of kilotons according to the targets of strike is a multifunctional thermonuclear warhead which not only has enormous lethality and destructibility, but also can even carry out super-powerful EMP attack over an expansive area through detonation at high altitudes according to strategic goals,  the report said.

17198,EXPLODING AFRICAN REFUGEE POPULATION STRESSING WELFARE SYSTEM IN MINNESOTA Are Sending Millions Of Dollars Back To Africa,"It s not just the our open southern borders we need to be concerned about. It s our State Department who seems to be hell-bent on populating our states with refugees from mostly muslim nations in Africa and the Middle East.This is one of those feel-good stories about how Minnesota is such a wonderful state with its ever-expanding African migrant population. If you are a Minnesotan it s probably a good thing to read.However, I caution readers on the numbers. The TwinCities Pioneer Press reports that there are about 85,000 Somalis in the whole US and that just isn t so the number is much larger. We painstakingly researched the numbers for just those entering the US through the refugee program and came up with over 100,000 in the last 25 years and that doesn t include a couple generations now of producing children. See this early post.You will see mention in the story that when census takers come around, the Africans are less than truthful about how many are living at the location.From TwinCities Pioneer Press:Of the 50 states, Minnesota has the ninth-largest population of African immigrants. About 60 percent come from East African nations such as Somalia and Ethiopia, and 25 percent from West African nations such as Nigeria and Liberia. The rest come from elsewhere in Africa.Of more than 85,700 Somalis officially known to reside in the U.S., nearly a third are thought to reside in Minnesota.Corrie, a professor at Concordia University in St. Paul, believes the state s African population produces $14 million in philanthropy within Minnesota each year, on top of $150 million in annual remittances to countries in Africa.I don t know why this is considered a good thing sending money out of America that will never benefit our economy!Some of the  smart  people on our side should get to work doing studies that will show the real picture including how much welfare is consumed by the immigrants, how costly is their medical care and education, the cost to the criminal justice system, and include an analysis of where the money goes!I m starting to think that glowing reports about how immigrants benefit the local economy include the money flowing into a state like Minnesota from the federal tax payer via welfare programs. Someone needs to find out!By the way, I don t see any mention in the Pioneer Press story about the fact that half of the state s Somalis live in poverty, here. Via: Refugee Resettlement WatchThe State Department has helped to relocate tens of thousands of refugees from the war-torn African nation of Somalia to Minnesota, where they can take advantage of some of America s most generous welfare and charity programs.But the effort is having the unintended consequence of creating an enclave of immigrants with high unemployment that is both stressing the state s safety net and creating a rich pool of potential recruiting targets for Islamist terror groups.

Hannity told his audience,  Let me put it this way, if I m Hillary or fake news, I won t be sleeping well tonight. Watch:.@seanhannity TICK TOCK Tonight Folks  Get ready @HillaryClinton  pic.twitter.com/PxbRCgyPwm  'GITMO' BAMA   (@President1Trump) October 17, 2017Well, John Solomon and Alison Spann s story did indeed break first thing today in The Hill, and it s a doozy. Will justice finally be delivered to these corrupt, anti-American, self-serving and lying players? Not providing information on a corruption scheme before the Russian uranium deal was approved by U.S. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine U.S. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them. The Russian efforts to manipulate our American political enterprise is breathtaking.    Former House Intelligence Chair Mike Rogers (R-MI)The Hill   Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account   backed by documents   indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted  with the consent of higher level officials  in Russia who  shared the proceeds  from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefitting Putin s commercial nuclear ambitions.The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America s uranium supply.When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she  never intervened   on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter. In 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program. The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,  a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.The Obama administration s decision to approve Rosatom s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.That s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI, in fact, had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee s decision that Vadim Mikerin   the main Russian overseeing Putin s nuclear expansion inside the United States   was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.Then-Attorney General Eric Holder was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn t comment.Mikerin was a director of Rosatom s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom s new American arm called Tenam.Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin  did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons   to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,  a November 2014 indictment stated.His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show. The investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.On August 6, 2017,  The Washington Times questioned Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein s  fishing expedition  aimed at digging up dirt on President Trump in his investigation in the Trump-Russia investigation. The special counsel is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Justice, and we don t engage in fishing expeditions,  Mr. Rosenstein said on  Fox News Sunday. In his first Sunday show interview, Mr. Rosenstein added that special counsel Robert Mueller  understands and I understand the specific scope of the investigation and so, it s not a fishing expedition. Mr. Rosenstein s comments come amid reports citing unnamed sources that the investigation has expanded into Mr. Trump s finances unrelated to possible Russian interference in last year s election.Mr. Rosenstein played down the reports:  That s not anything that I ve said. That s not anything Director Mueller has said. We don t know who s saying it or how credible those sources are. Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven collusion between Russia and Donald Trump s campaign during the 2016 election.McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI.The connections to the current Russia case are many. The Mikerin probe began in 2009 when Robert Mueller, now the special counsel in charge of the Trump case, was still FBI director. And it ended in late 2015 under the direction of then-FBI Director James Comey, who Trump fired earlier this year.Bringing down a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the U.S. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency s cap.But the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged.The only public statement occurred an entire year later when the Justice Department put out a little-noticed press release in August 2015, just days before Labor Day. The release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals.The lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.On Dec. 15, 2015, the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mikerin,  a former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison  and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.Ronald Hosko, who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, told The Hill he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged. I had no idea this case was being conducted,  a surprised Hosko said in an interview.Meanwhile, Julian Assange is jumping on the bandwagon, as he teases that he has a major announcement of his own that is coming soon Russian nuclear bribery investigation reveals that Russia routed millions to the Clintons https://t.co/ti7ycn7auf  Julian Assange   (@JulianAssange) October 17, 2017",politics,"Oct 18, 2017"
7104, Today Is The One-Year Anniversary Of Walter Scott’s Murder By Cop (VIDEO),"On April 4th, 2015, 50-year-old Walter Scott, a father of four, was pulled over by Officer Michael Slager in North Charleston, South Carolina. The cop reportedly stopped him for a broken brake light. The officer lied and said Scott attacked him and took his taser, but a bystander recorded the incident on a cell phone to the horrifying dismay of the country. The video clearly shows an unarmed Scott running away from the officer. Instead of pursuing Scott, the officer fires eight shots, killing Scott.The city agreed to pay Scott s family $6.5 million, and a grand jury handed down a murder indictment for Officer Michael Slager. Such settlements and indictments for police officers who shoot people are extremely rare, and Walter Scott is one of many black victims over the past few years to be killed by a white police officer, while police departments across the country fail to assume accountability for these constant occurrences. Freddie Gray, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Tanisha Anderson, John Crawford III, Michael Brown Jr   the list goes on and on.People of color are increasingly at risk for being at the wrong place at the wrong time when it comes to excessive force used by many police departments. Instead of holding the officers and their departments accountable, the victims are often subjected to attacks and criticisms to disregard the outrage, unrest, and civil disobedience in cities like Ferguson, Missouri or Baltimore, Maryland. They don t acknowledge the pain and trauma inflicted on these communities by police departments who police in ways that render unarmed people being shot to death. The officer is currently out on bail of $500,000 awaiting trial later this year. This is a travesty, as given the nature of the crime, no bail should have been granted. Non-violent criminals have received stricter bail bonds. Slager also tried to sue the Southern States Police Benevolent Association for not helping him with his defense.Hopefully, there is a murder conviction in this man s future.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 4, 2016"

There was an angry response in Russia, where the Kremlin warned that the strikes would cause  significant damage to US-Russia ties .NOTE: Tillerson has now gone so far as to blame Russia for  allowing  Syria to mount this attack They would act as the guarantor that these weapons would no longer be present in Syria. Clearly Russia has failed in its responsibility to deliver on that commitment from 2013. Either Russia has been complicit or Russia has been simply incompetent in its ability to deliver on its end of that agreement.

18301,SYRIAN MUSLIM IMMIGRANT HAIRDRESSER SLITS Female Employer’s Throat After Media Hailed Him As “Example Of Successful Integration”,"She wanted him to assimilate. She gave him a good job. She trusted him and offered the chance to prove he was willing to be a good employee. He slit her throat. There was nothing special or unique about Mohammad Hussain Rashwani, he was just another Muslim immigrant looking for a better life who had no interest in assimilating. Slitting his employer s throat is how Rashwani chose to show his gratitude for her trust in him.Mohammad Hussain Rashwani was hailed in the media as the  paramount example of successful integration  after he got a job as a hairdresser at a salon in Herzberg, Germany in late 2015.After a little over a year on the job, he decided to slit his female employer s throat.From Lausitzer Rundschau as translated by Gates of Vienna:  For me there weren t any signs that I could see Herzberg s hairdresser speaks about the knife attack by her Syrian employeeHerzberg s master hairdresser talks about what is motivating her these days since the attack by her Syrian employee two weeks ago.Should she have seen this attack against her coming? She keeps asking herself this question over and over. And she can t find an answer.  Even today, I do not know what I should think. Until that Wednesday evening, he was an endearing man. I believed up to the very last minute that something good could come of him because I appreciated his professional abilities very much,  Ilona F. says.The Herzberg woman doesn t want to talk about the attack itself; her thoughts are much more circling around  why  again and again.  Did I intervene too much? Was I too strong for him? Did we, my husband and I, organize too much for him?  These and other thoughts are constantly crossing her mind. But there weren t any signs that the Damascus-born Syrian maybe had other plans. His mother, which whom Ilona F. was in contact, had repeatedly written how grateful her son was for the chance that he received and how much he had respected the  she-boss .  He even assured my husband and me personally of this. Yet still, something had to have happened to him that made him commit this terrible bloody deed.  For me, there were no signs that something like this could happen,  the 64-year-old says, looking back. But, she admits, he had changed considerably in the past few months. Ilona F. explains:  We had invested a lot of time in him after our spectacular beginnings, and we had helped him in every way possible. We had plans. He is an outstanding hairdresser. The customers were super-happy with his work. Until the very last minute I had believed that things were going to work. Here s where the story that is all too typical of Muslim immigrants starts to take shape:Even then changes started to set in. He, a Muslim who until now did not seem in any way a devout believer, had began to talk about Allah more and more. This certainly got on her nerves for over time. He also quit visiting the hairdresser and her husband at home. Before the changes he came by almost every day. They had talked about everything, professional and private. But he had begun to neglect his study of the German language more and more.  He kept assuring me that he wanted to learn the language, but later. More and more he said later this, later that, when we talked about his future,  the businesswoman recounts.And then there were also problems in the salon. Mohammad H. came to work too late more often; he didn t take time very seriously. He became very reluctant to drive to work at Sch newalde, where his boss owned a second hair salon. And during the week the attack took place, he outright refused to go.After a disagreement in the Herzberg salon, when a customer was unhappy with the work of the Syrian hairdresser, she had given him notice that they had to talk.  I knew it couldn t go on like this. But immediately the question arose in my mind, what would become of him if I were to throw him out. After all, I still believed in him. That this by now was a fatal mistake is something the Herzberg woman is only slowly beginning to realize.  That I could have been so wrong in my judgment of another person,  she shakes her head.  Actually, I feel really sorry for him.   Information Liberation ",left-news,"Jul 17, 2017"
18334,DETROIT SCHOOLS CHIEF Wants To Shut Down Charter Schools Ranked “Best In The State” To Focus On Public Schools Ranked “Worst Urban School District In Country”,"Liberal logic 101 The new superintendent for Detroit s public schools said he will recommend the school district no longer authorize charter schools and focus instead on improving its conventional schools, according to the Detroit Free Press. We have to get it right with traditional public schools and our focus, our energy, our resources need to be on that,  Superintendent Nikolai Vitti told the Free Press.Hechinger Report   Since 1994, there has been an extreme decline in Detroit Public Schools  enrollment: 73 percent. This has had a huge impact on the financial stability of the district and the performance of its remaining schools. However, the expansion of charter schools is just one reason for the decline in enrollment. During that same time, the overall population in the city declined by 33 percent. In addition, the district lost a considerable number of students to inter-district choice programs with neighboring school districts, which enroll more students statewide than charter schools.ForTheRecord says: Two charter schools authorized by Detroit s public schools were rated as the best in the state, according to a report card published by the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. The report card examined Michigan s middle and elementary schools and adjusted their rankings to reflect the impact of students  economic background.Detroit s Martin Luther King Jr. Education Center Academy was the top rated elementary and middle school in the state. Ross/Hill Academy was the second-best.Ironically, Detroit s public schools have been rated as the worst large urban school district in the country. In 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2015, the National Assessment of Education Progress did assessments and Detroit was rated as the worst in each time.Washington Examiner   According to a highly regarded study, in just one year Michigan charter school students earn an additional two months of learning gains over their traditional public school counterparts. For Detroit, charter students get an additional three months of learning in math and reading when compared to their traditional school peers.Most Michigan charter schools are authorized by state universities, and most conventional public school districts do not authorize any charters. Detroit is an exception, having authorized 14 charters.  Michigan Capitol Confidential",left-news,"Jul 11, 2017"
11134,15 SURPRISING FACTS About The White House Easter Egg Roll,"The big question this year for the White House Easter Egg roll is whether White House Press Scretary will show up as the Easter Bunny. A little known fact and tradition has been that Spicer is the Easter Bunny! What a guy! Who knew that the guy who dressed in the bunny costume would one day be the 45th President s Press Secretary 15 SURPRISING FACTS ABOUT THE WHITE HOUSE EASTER EGG ROLL:While the long-established custom of rolling eggs on the historic grounds has practically become a rite of passage for those who observe Easter, this time-honored tradition has come a long way since it was officially established by President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1878. In fact, the fun in Washington on Capitol Hill almost didn t become the grandstanding institution as we now know it today.Here, we look back at the White House Easter Egg Roll s 138-year history to highlight 15 of the most surprising and memorable moments associated with the most sought-after ticket in D.C.1. According to the White House Historical Association, some historians note that it was first lady Dolley Madison who originally proposed the idea of a public egg roll around 1810. Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson s young children held their own informal egg roll for their own amusement in the 1860s.2. Taking advantage of a day off from school, more than 10,000 children were said to have gathered near the cast-iron dome of the U.S. capitol in 1876. Baskets in tow, filled with dyed Easter eggs, they set about to carry on the holiday tradition of rolling eggs down the hills to see how far they d go without breaking.3. Uh oh, here comes the fun police. The unusual sport of rolling and racing after hard-cooked eggs apparently did a lot of damage to the grounds of the Capitol. So in 1876, members of Congress approved the Turf Protection Act, signed by President Ulysses S. Grant, which prevented the Capitol s grounds from being used  as a playground.  The law was supposed to take effect in 1877, but inclement weather prevented any Easter activities from occurring that year anyway. However, the egg rollers who showed up in 1878 were turned away and forced to play elsewhere.4. President Hayes and his wife, Lucy, brought the holiday tradition back later in 1878 for the first official White House Easter Egg Roll. Every year thereafter, with a few notable exceptions, presidents have hosted the celebration on the South Lawn.5. By the late 1800s, games such as egg picking, egg ball, toss and catch, and egg croquet were added to the Easter festivities.6. The treasured tradition was cancelled due to World War I and suspended during the Second World War in 1942. When the White House underwent renovations in that same year, it was hosted by Congress and held at other locations.7. After a 12-year hiatus, President Dwight D. Eisenhower brought the egg-stravaganza back in 1953.8. In 1969, the White House Easter Bunny went hoppin  down the government trail for the first time. The bunny was actually a staffer for first lady Pat Nixon. While we know that the Easter bunny is always part of the current administration s staff, the rules forbid the bunny from revealing his or her identity, until now that is.9. Ursula Meese, wife of President Reagan s Attorney General Edwin Meese III, was quite the Peter Rabbit of her time, as she performed as the White House Bunny for six seasons. It earned her the nickname  The Meester Bunny.  And thanks to this unofficial  Twitter account, we know just who was under the fleece costume during the George W. Bush Administration as well. Today, he s traded in the long bunny ears for a suit and a podium, but there s no word yet if current Press Secretary Sean Spicer will be making a furry-tailed appearance again for this year s celebration.10. Enter the sacred spoon in 1974. Organizers were tasked with finding silverware for the first egg-rolling races, where children used spoons to push their eggs through the grass, down marked-off lanes.11. Step right up: The circus came to town in 1977. President Jimmy Carter introduced a three-ring circus and menagerie, including a 1,200-pound steer named  Big Red. 12. President Ronald Reagan, a superstar in his own right, brought a little Hollywood to the White House event in 1981. Not only did he and wife, Nancy, present Broadway show performances and the  Egg Hunt Pits,  but they also had balloons from the Macy s Thanksgiving Day Parade floating in mid-air.13. The Reagans were also the first to use wooden eggs at the Easter egg hunt, which were signed by Hollywood s elite, widely-recognized athletes, and notable politicians. Ever since, wooden eggs imprinted with the president and first lady s signatures are handed out as a small memento to children under 13 years old.14. By 2009, the Easter Egg Roll had become the hottest ticket in D.C. So much so, an online lottery for tickets was established to give children from all around the country the opportunity to attend. The lottery is held in March each year for three days only.15. Sean Spicer is the Easter Bunny!WHAT A GUY!Via: Southern Living",politics,"Apr 15, 2017"

2561, CNN Just TORPEDOED Donald Trump With Facts To PROVE He Lied About Them Again,"CNN is definitely sick and tired of Donald Trump calling them  fake news. During an interview with Erin Burnett on Friday, Bernie Sanders jokingly referred to CNN as  fake news  to mock Donald Trump. Sanders even made sure to let Burnett know that he was just joking and Burnett acknowledged that Sanders was just joking. Soon after, a technical difficulty arose as Sanders could no longer hear Burnett. CNN then went to commercial, and Burnett apologized to the audience and to Sanders for the issue and resumed the conversation.Here s the video via CNN.Well, Fox News claimed that CNN cut off Sanders in retaliation for his  fake news  joke. And then Donald Trump tweeted about it several minutes later and made the same claim.While on FAKE NEWS @CNN, Bernie Sanders was cut off for using the term fake news to describe the network. They said technical difficulties!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2017That s when CNN proceeded to strongly fire back as Brian Stelter set the record straight by linking to the full video of the interview and call Trump out for lying.Untrue.

Those are the facts. https://t.co/NzJNgdYSIX pic.twitter.com/AOFKLHUlGk  CNN Communications (@CNNPR) February 12, 2017Clearly, Donald Trump once again got  alternative facts  from Fox News and repeated them as his proof that CNN is  fake news. But if he had simply taken ten minutes to watch the actual interview, he would know that Sanders was only joking, and that CNN did not cut Sanders off. It really was a technical difficulty and Sanders was able to continue the interview after the issue was fixed. But Trump didn t bother to do that, and he got his ass handed to him for it.Last week, Trump claimed that CNN host Chris Cuomo failed to ask a guest a specific question, only to get skewered by Cuomo and CNN Communications again for lying. Had Trump watched the very beginning of the interview, he wouldn t have humiliated himself.. @ChrisCuomo did address that point at the start of his interview. Those are the facts: https://t.co/JWJEAshv1y  CNN Communications (@CNNPR) February 9, 2017Donald Trump won t bother to do simple research before he runs his mouth on Twitter, and that means he probably doesn t bother to do any research before making decisions as president.

20707,TRUMP HATER GEORGE RAMOS Promotes Movie Showing Illegal Aliens Being Shot At Border By Drunk Vigilante…Blames Trump [VIDEO],"Mexico has been the beneficiary of our open borders for decades. It s really quite amazing how loudly they cry foul when we finally have a presidential candidate willing to stand up to this insanity and say,  ENOUGH! It s Time to put Americans first! Illegal immigrants send home $50 billion annually but cost taxpayers more than $113 billion. Approximately 126,000 illegal immigrants emigrated from these three nations to the U.S. since last October and federal officials estimate at least 95,500 more will enter next year.The Central American governments have encouraged the high levels of emigration because it is earning their economy billions of dollars! For every illegal alien that sneaks into the U.S. and remits money back home, that grand total remittance number only grows. But what if the millions of U.S. jobs now filled by illegal aliens were done by American workers earning better wages, paying more in taxes and spending their money in their communities rather than sending it abroad?Americans are the ones forced to pick up the $113 billion tab for taking care of the country s 12 million illegal immigrants. Is it the responsibility of taxpaying citizens to cover the cost of illegal immigration and the government s aid to these countries while illegal workers continue to send their money overseas to send $50 billion overseas? Via: immigrationreform.comYet, somehow Donald Trump is to BLAME for wanting to shut down our open borders and bring some sanity back to our nation that is being overrun by Mexican drug runners and gang bangers coming from every corner of Mexico, Central and South America? A new Mexican movie promoted by Univision host Jorge Ramos portrays a drunk vigilante motivated by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump s anti-immigrant rant killing at least four illegal immigrants at the border.The trailer for the movie, Desierto, now in Mexican theaters, blasts out Trump s initial criticism of illegal immigrants as a man armed with a rifle guns down targets crossing under barbed wire.https://youtu.be/V48ttgGqsswIt later shows the same man, in a pickup holding a bottle of what appears to be whisky, a beer can nearby, as a voice says,  Welcome to the land of the free.  The trailer ends with,  words are as dangerous as bullets. The Center for Immigration Studies on Tuesday first blogged on the  exploitation  movie and the promotion by Ramos on his Sunday show Al Punto. This material resonates powerfully with Jorge Ramos. His conviction that racism and xenophobia are the driving forces of opposition to illegal immigration is a central theme of his nightly newscasts. Ramos fixates on reports that confirm his conviction with the obsessiveness of an exploitation film director showing close-ups of bullets tearing into human flesh,  wrote CIS Fellow Jerry Kammer.He added:  On Sunday, Ramos talked with  Desierto  director Jonas Cuaron and star Gael Garcia Bernal about Trump s repugnant comments about Mexicans. Since then, Ramos said,  there are thousands if not millions of North Americans who feel that they have the absolute freedom to be racists. Via: Washington Examiner",left-news,"Apr 20, 2016"
7671, Louis C.K. Tears ‘Insane Bigot’ Donald Trump Apart In Devastating Rant: ‘The Guy Is Hitler’ (IMAGE),"Add comedian Louis C.K. to the ever-growing lost of people trying to stop Republican front-runner Donald Trump from getting any closer to the White House. In a scathing rant released on Saturday morning, C.K. skewered Trump with a plea to voters in an email about his web series  Horace and Pete. C.K. compared Trump to Adolf Hitler, stating that the Nazi leader was once thought to be just a harmless crazy nut   until it was too late to stop him. C.K. s message, which appeared in full on Variety, said: Please stop it with voting for Trump. It was funny for a little while. But the guy is Hitler. And by that I mean that we are being Germany in the  30s. Do you think they saw the s t coming? Hitler was just some hilarious and refreshing dude with a weird comb over who would say anything at all. Twitter He s not a monster. He s a sad man. But all this makes him horribly dangerous if he becomes president. Give him another TV show. Let him pay to put his name on buildings. But please stop voting for him. C.K. didn t mince his words as he continued, stating that voting for Trump would be  national suicide. I get that all these people sound like bullshit soft criminal opportunists. The whole game feels rigged and it s not going anywhere but down anymore. I feel that way sometimes. And that voting for Trump is a way of saying  f*ck it. F*ck them all . I really get it. It s a version of national Suicide. Or it s like a big hit off of a crack pipe. Somehow we can t help it. Or we know that if we vote for Trump our phones will be a reliable source of dopamine for the next four years. I mean I can t wait to read about Trump every day. It s a rush. But you have to know this is not healthy. C.K. noted that although he likes the Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, he would enjoy seeing the next president as a conservative. However, he s smart enough to recognize that Trump is not the guy to face Sanders or Clinton, and certainly not presidential material: I m not advocating for Hillary or Bernie. I like them both but frankly I wish the next president was a conservative only because we had Obama for eight years and we need balance. And not because I particularly enjoy the conservative agenda. I just think the government should reflect the people. And we are about 40 percent conservative and 40 percent liberal. When I was growing up and when I was a younger man, liberals and conservatives were friends with differences. They weren t enemies. And it always made sense that everyone gets a president they like for a while and then hates the president for a while. But it only works if the conservatives put up a good candidate. A good smart conservative to face the liberal candidate so they can have a good argument and the country can decide which way to go this time. Trump is not that. He s an insane bigot. He is dangerous. For all the conservatives that have pledged to vote for Trump despite how awful they acknowledge him to be, C.K. had some much-needed advice: If you are a true conservative. Don t vote for Trump. He is not one of you. He is one of him. Everything you have heard him say that you liked, if you look hard enough you will see that he one day said the exact opposite. He is playing you. Trump is not your best. He s the worst of all of us. He s a symptom to a problem that is very real. But don t vote for your own cancer. You re better than that. C.K. is just the latest comedian to blast Trump, and his message follows an epic verbal lashing from John Oliver on Last Week Tonight, which aired a 20-minute takedown of Trump. Many other celebrities, including Miley Cyrus, George Clooney, and Stephen King, have also urged voters to wise up and forget about voting for the business mogul.Currently, the Republican party is scrambling to figure out what to do with Trump. He s currently dominating the GOP polls, and even though several conservatives have pledged to stop him, many Republicans feel helpless and are afraid no other candidate will be able to stop him from getting the nomination.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons and Gage Skidmore",News,"March 5, 2016"

Two years ago, CEO s of major companies agreed to ban guns in states where citizens are allowed to carry guns. How long will America sit back and allow the Left to dictate the terms by which we live? Our safety and security is slipping away and we don t appear to have too many people in DC standing up for our rights. Meanwhile, the media seems to be perplexed over the rise of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in the polls go figure FLASHBACK:Sept. 2014: Bakery-cafe chain Panera Bread has joined a growing list of retailers including Starbucks and Target by announcing that customers should leave their guns at home.The 1,800-outlet, $4.2 billion (market cap) company issued a brief statement on Monday after CEO Ron Shaich spoke to CNBC about the decision:Within our company, we strive to create Panera Warmth. This warmth means bakery-cafes where customers and associates feel comfortable and welcome. To this end, we ask that guns not be brought into this environment unless carried by an authorized law enforcement officer. Panera respects the rights of gun owners, but asks our customers to help preserve the environment we are working to create for our guests and associates.In the weeks and months leading up to this policy announcement, Panera Bread sought advice from Michael Bloomberg-backed Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, now part of the former Mayor s $50 million Everytown nonprofit. Panera deserves our thanks and our congratulations for taking this important step, and I applaud the company for proactively consulting Moms Demand Action as it developed and implemented its policy,  said the group s founder Shannon Watts, who has herself become the focus of ire from open carry activists and the NRA in recent months following efforts to see retailers and restaurant chains change their firearms policies.Watts and her team have most recently spent six figures on an ad blitz aiming to force the hand of Kroger, the country s largest grocery store chain. As of press time, Kroger maintained it would respect state and local laws on gun rights. Via: Forbes February 10, 2016:ABINGDON, Md.  Two Harford County Sheriff s deputies have succumbed to their injuries after shootings at an Abingdon shopping center, officials said.Authorities said a deputy responded to a disturbance call at 11:46 a.m. Wednesday at the Panera Bread near Emmorton Road in Abingdon. That deputy was wounded when at least one shot was fired in his direction, Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler said. Gahler said restaurant witnesses gave good information as to which way the shooter went. A second responding deputy found the suspect, and shots were fired again, injuring the second deputy. We believe the deputies were shot by the same suspect,  Gahler said. (The shooter) just took out his gun and shot him in the head right after the officer asked him,  How s your day?  witness Sophia Faulkner said.Two additional deputies, who responded to the initial shooting, fired rounds, and a short time later, the suspect was killed, Gahler said. The suspect was identified as 67-year-old David Evans, Gahler said. We know that there were two warrants for his arrest,  Gahler said.  We believe we were sent (to Panera Bread), because someone knew who he was. Police said Evans had two open warrants in two states. Evans had a criminal warrant in Florida for assaulting a police officer and fleeing and eluding police. In Harford County, Evans had an open civil warrant.A loaded handgun was found with Evans after the shootout, Gahler said. We are not looking for anyone else,  Gahler said.  There is no longer a threat to the community. The two deputies involved in shooting the suspect were placed on administrative leave, per agency protocol pending a completed investigation, Gahler said.SkyTeam 11 Capt. Roy Taylor reported that at least one deputy was airlifted to Shock Trauma. The other deputy was taken to University of Maryland Upper Chesapeake Medical Center in Bel Air. During a news conference Wednesday evening, Gahler said both deputies succumbed to their injuries. Today s a sad day for the Harford County Sheriff s Office and the citizens of Harford County, who we are sworn to serve. It s with great sadness that I tell you both deputies who were shot earlier today have succumbed to their injuries. One of our deputies was a 30-year veteran of this agency, served in the Court Services Division. The other deputy had served this agency for the last 16 years and was assigned to the Community Services Division. I would ask you at this time to please respect the families  privacy as they go through the period of grieving. I ve met with both families. I still have to go to Upper Chesapeake. Obviously, I don t think I have to tell anybody. There s no words to describe what they are going through right now,  Gahler said. Anytime law enforcement or first responders lose their lives in the line of duty, it is a tragedy and today s violence in Abingdon and the deaths of two Harford County sheriff s deputies is nothing less than absolutely heartbreaking,  Gov. Larry Hogan said. ",left-news,"Feb 11, 2016"

22013,What is The Deep State?,"One of the ancillary benefits of Donald Trump s insurgence into the US political scene has been a forceful injection of realism into the national political discourse. One of those points of discussion is centered around the concept of a  state within a state,  commonly referred to as the Deep State. It s suddenly become an acceptable mainstream idea, but prior to the 2016 election cycle, that conversation was strictly a fringe affair, mostly relegated to the realms of  conspiracy  forums and alternative media. but now it s written and spoken about as a mainstream talking point. One of the most coherent articulations of this idea originated from a former US Congressional staffer turned best-selling author, Mike Lofgren. In his book, The Deep State, he outlines the shape and structure of this seemingly invisible  state within a state,  but unlike the establishment media s innocuous commentary, Lofgren also delivers a incisive moral verdict on this power transition and explains how it s not only eviscerating the fabric of democracy and the foundations of the Constitutional Republic, but more importantly how it s destroying society.More than ever, it s important to understand just how we arrived at this crucial point in history and more importantly   what can be done to derail this silent coup in the United States, and internationally too.The following essay was written by Lofgren in 2014, and still stands firm as a critical deconstruction of the current shadow state set-up in America . Rome lived upon its principal till ruin stared it in the face. Industry is the only true source of wealth, and there was no industry in Rome. By day the Ostia road was crowded with carts and muleteers, carrying to the great city the silks and spices of the East, the marble of Asia Minor, the timber of the Atlas, the grain of Africa and Egypt; and the carts brought out nothing but loads of dung. That was their return cargo.  The Martyrdom of Man, by Winwood Reade (1871) . By Mike LofgrenThere is the visible government situated around the Mall in Washington, and then there is another, more shadowy, more indefinable government that is not explained in Civics 101 or observable to tourists at the White House or the Capitol. The former is traditional Washington partisan politics: the tip of the iceberg that a public watching C-SPAN sees daily and which is theoretically controllable via elections. The subsurface part of the iceberg I shall call the Deep State, which operates according to its own compass heading regardless of who is formally in power. [1]During the last five years, the news media have been flooded with pundits decrying the broken politics of Washington. The conventional wisdom has it that partisan gridlock and dysfunction have become the new normal. That is certainly the case, and I have been among the harshest critics of this development. But it is also imperative to acknowledge the limits of this critique as it applies to the American governmental system. On one level, the critique is self-evident: In the domain that the public can see, Congress is hopelessly deadlocked in the worst manner since the 1850s, the violently rancorous decade preceding the Civil War.Yes, there is another government concealed behind the one that is visible at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue, a hybrid entity of public and private institutions ruling the country As I wrote in The Party is Over, the present objective of congressional Republicans is to render the executive branch powerless, at least until a Republican president is elected (a goal that voter suppression laws in GOP-controlled states are clearly intended to accomplish). President Obama cannot enact his domestic policies and budgets: Because of incessant GOP filibustering, not only could he not fill the large number of vacancies in the federal judiciary, he could not even get his most innocuous presidential appointees into office. Democrats controlling the Senate have responded by weakening the filibuster of nominations, but Republicans are sure to react with other parliamentary delaying tactics. This strategy amounts to congressional nullification of executive branch powers by a party that controls a majority in only one house of Congress. Despite this apparent impotence, President Obama can liquidate American citizens without due processes, detain prisoners indefinitely without charge, conduct dragnet surveillance on the American people without judicial warrant and engage in unprecedented   at least since the McCarthy era   witch hunts against federal employees (the so-called  Insider Threat Program ). Within the United States, this power is characterized by massive displays of intimidating force by militarized federal, state and local law enforcement. Abroad, President Obama can start wars at will and engage in virtually any other activity whatsoever without so much as a by-your-leave from Congress, such as arranging the forced landing of a plane carrying a sovereign head of state over foreign territory. Despite the habitual cant of congressional Republicans about executive overreach by Obama, the would-be dictator, we have until recently heard very little from them about these actions   with the minor exception of comments from gadfly Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. Democrats, save a few mavericks such as Ron Wyden of Oregon, are not unduly troubled, either   even to the extent of permitting seemingly perjured congressional testimony under oath by executive branch officials on the subject of illegal surveillance.These are not isolated instances of a contradiction; they have been so pervasive that they tend to be disregarded as background noise. During the time in 2011 when political warfare over the debt ceiling was beginning to paralyze the business of governance in Washington, the United States government somehow summoned the resources to overthrow Muammar Ghaddafi s regime in Libya, and, when the instability created by that coup spilled over into Mali, provide overt and covert assistance to French intervention there. At a time when there was heated debate about continuing meat inspections and civilian air traffic control because of the budget crisis, our government was somehow able to commit $115 million to keeping a civil war going in Syria and to pay at least  100m to the United Kingdom s Government Communications Headquarters to buy influence over and access to that country s intelligence. Since 2007, two bridges carrying interstate highways have collapsed due to inadequate maintenance of infrastructure, one killing 13 people. During that same period of time, the government spent $1.7 billion constructing a building in Utah that is the size of 17 football fields. This mammoth structure is intended to allow the National Security Agency to store a yottabyte of information, the largest numerical designator computer scientists have coined. A yottabyte is equal to 500 quintillion pages of text. They need that much storage to archive every single trace of your electronic life.Yes, there is another government concealed behind the one that is visible at either end of Pennsylvania Avenue, a hybrid entity of public and private institutions ruling the country according to consistent patterns in season and out, connected to, but only intermittently controlled by, the visible state whose leaders we choose. My analysis of this phenomenon is not an expos  of a secret, conspiratorial cabal; the state within a state is hiding mostly in plain sight, and its operators mainly act in the light of day. Nor can this other government be accurately termed an  establishment.  All complex societies have an establishment, a social network committed to its own enrichment and perpetuation. In terms of its scope, financial resources and sheer global reach, the American hybrid state, the Deep State, is in a class by itself. That said, it is neither omniscient nor invincible. The institution is not so much sinister (although it has highly sinister aspects) as it is relentlessly well entrenched. Far from being invincible, its failures, such as those in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya, are routine enough that it is only the Deep State s protectiveness towards its higher-ranking personnel that allows them to escape the consequences of their frequent ineptitude. [2]How did I come to write an analysis of the Deep State, and why am I equipped to write it? As a congressional staff member for 28 years specializing in national security and possessing a top secret security clearance, I was at least on the fringes of the world I am describing, if neither totally in it by virtue of full membership nor of it by psychological disposition. But, like virtually every employed person, I became, to some extent, assimilated into the culture of the institution I worked for, and only by slow degrees, starting before the invasion of Iraq, did I begin fundamentally to question the reasons of state that motivate the people who are, to quote George W. Bush,  the deciders. Cultural assimilation is partly a matter of what psychologist Irving L. Janis called  groupthink,  the chameleon-like ability of people to adopt the views of their superiors and peers. This syndrome is endemic to Washington: The town is characterized by sudden fads, be it negotiating biennial budgeting, making grand bargains or invading countries. Then, after a while, all the town s cool kids drop those ideas as if they were radioactive. As in the military, everybody has to get on board with the mission, and questioning it is not a career-enhancing move. The universe of people who will critically examine the goings-on at the institutions they work for is always going to be a small one. As Upton Sinclair said,  It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it. A more elusive aspect of cultural assimilation is the sheer dead weight of the ordinariness of it all once you have planted yourself in your office chair for the 10,000th time. Government life is typically not some vignette from an Allen Drury novel about intrigue under the Capitol dome. Sitting and staring at the clock on the off-white office wall when it s 11:00 in the evening and you are vowing never, ever to eat another piece of takeout pizza in your life is not an experience that summons the higher literary instincts of a would-be memoirist. After a while, a functionary of the state begins to hear things that, in another context, would be quite remarkable, or at least noteworthy, and yet that simply bounce off one s consciousness like pebbles off steel plate:  You mean the number of terrorist groups we are fighting is classified?  No wonder so few people are whistle-blowers, quite apart from the vicious retaliation whistle-blowing often provokes: Unless one is blessed with imagination and a fine sense of irony, growing immune to the curiousness of one s surroundings is easy. To paraphrase the inimitable Donald Rumsfeld, I didn t know all that I knew, at least until I had had a couple of years away from the government to reflect upon it.The Deep State does not consist of the entire government. It is a hybrid of national security and law enforcement agencies: the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Justice Department. I also include the Department of the Treasury because of its jurisdiction over financial flows, its enforcement of international sanctions and its organic symbiosis with Wall Street. All these agencies are coordinated by the Executive Office of the President via the National Security Council. Certain key areas of the judiciary belong to the Deep State, such as the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, whose actions are mysterious even to most members of Congress. Also included are a handful of vital federal trial courts, such as the Eastern District of Virginia and the Southern District of Manhattan, where sensitive proceedings in national security cases are conducted. The final government component (and possibly last in precedence among the formal branches of government established by the Constitution) is a kind of rump Congress consisting of the congressional leadership and some (but not all) of the members of the defense and intelligence committees. The rest of Congress, normally so fractious and partisan, is mostly only intermittently aware of the Deep State and when required usually submits to a few well-chosen words from the State s emissaries.I saw this submissiveness on many occasions. One memorable incident was passage of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Amendments Act of 2008. This legislation retroactively legalized the Bush administration s illegal and unconstitutional surveillance first revealed by The New York Times in 2005 and indemnified the telecommunications companies for their cooperation in these acts. The bill passed easily: All that was required was the invocation of the word  terrorism  and most members of Congress responded like iron filings obeying a magnet. One who responded in that fashion was Senator Barack Obama, soon to be coronated as the presidential nominee at the Democratic National Convention in Denver. He had already won the most delegates by campaigning to the left of his main opponent, Hillary Clinton, on the excesses of the global war on terror and the erosion of constitutional liberties.As the indemnification vote showed, the Deep State does not consist only of government agencies. What is euphemistically called  private enterprise  is an integral part of its operations. In a special series in The Washington Post called  Top Secret America,  Dana Priest and William K. Arkin described the scope of the privatized Deep State and the degree to which it has metastasized after the September 11 attacks. There are now 854,000 contract personnel with top-secret clearances   a number greater than that of top-secret-cleared civilian employees of the government. While they work throughout the country and the world, their heavy concentration in and around the Washington suburbs is unmistakable: Since 9/11, 33 facilities for top-secret intelligence have been built or are under construction. Combined, they occupy the floor space of almost three Pentagons   about 17 million square feet. Seventy percent of the intelligence community s budget goes to paying contracts. And the membrane between government and industry is highly permeable: The Director of National Intelligence, James R. Clapper, is a former executive of Booz Allen Hamilton, one of the government s largest intelligence contractors. His predecessor as director, Admiral Mike McConnell, is the current vice chairman of the same company; Booz Allen is 99 percent dependent on government business. These contractors now set the political and social tone of Washington, just as they are increasingly setting the direction of the country, but they are doing it quietly, their doings unrecorded in the Congressional Record or the Federal Register, and are rarely subject to congressional hearings.Washington is the most important node of the Deep State that has taken over America, but it is not the only one. Invisible threads of money and ambition connect the town to other nodes. One is Wall Street, which supplies the cash that keeps the political machine quiescent and operating as a diversionary marionette theater. Should the politicians forget their lines and threaten the status quo, Wall Street floods the town with cash and lawyers to help the hired hands remember their own best interests. The executives of the financial giants even have de facto criminal immunity. On March 6, 2013, testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General Eric Holder stated the following:  I am concerned that the size of some of these institutions becomes so large that it does become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if you do prosecute, if you do bring a criminal charge, it will have a negative impact on the national economy, perhaps even the world economy.  This, from the chief law enforcement officer of a justice system that has practically abolished the constitutional right to trial for poorer defendants charged with certain crimes. It is not too much to say that Wall Street may be the ultimate owner of the Deep State and its strategies, if for no other reason than that it has the money to reward government operatives with a second career that is lucrative beyond the dreams of avarice   certainly beyond the dreams of a salaried government employee. [3]The corridor between Manhattan and Washington is a well trodden highway for the personalities we have all gotten to know in the period since the massive deregulation of Wall Street: Robert Rubin, Lawrence Summers, Henry Paulson, Timothy Geithner and many others. Not all the traffic involves persons connected with the purely financial operations of the government: In 2013, General David Petraeus joined KKR (formerly Kohlberg Kravis Roberts) of 9 West 57th Street, New York, a private equity firm with $62.3 billion in assets. KKR specializes in management buyouts and leveraged finance. General Petraeus  expertise in these areas is unclear. His ability to peddle influence, however, is a known and valued commodity. Unlike Cincinnatus, the military commanders of the Deep State do not take up the plow once they lay down the sword. Petraeus also obtained a sinecure as a non-resident senior fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard. The Ivy League is, of course, the preferred bleaching tub and charm school of the American oligarchy. [4]Petraeus and most of the avatars of the Deep State   the White House advisers who urged Obama not to impose compensation limits on Wall Street CEOs, the contractor-connected think tank experts who besought us to  stay the course  in Iraq, the economic gurus who perpetually demonstrate that globalization and deregulation are a blessing that makes us all better off in the long run   are careful to pretend that they have no ideology. Their preferred pose is that of the politically neutral technocrat offering well considered advice based on profound expertise. That is nonsense. They are deeply dyed in the hue of the official ideology of the governing class, an ideology that is neither specifically Democrat nor Republican. Domestically, whatever they might privately believe about essentially diversionary social issues such as abortion or gay marriage, they almost invariably believe in the  Washington Consensus : financialization, outsourcing, privatization, deregulation and the commodifying of labor. Internationally, they espouse 21st-century  American Exceptionalism : the right and duty of the United States to meddle in every region of the world with coercive diplomacy and boots on the ground and to ignore painfully won international norms of civilized behavior. To paraphrase what Sir John Harrington said more than 400 years ago about treason, now that the ideology of the Deep State has prospered, none dare call it ideology. [5] That is why describing torture with the word  torture  on broadcast television is treated less as political heresy than as an inexcusable lapse of Washington etiquette: Like smoking a cigarette on camera, these days it is simply  not done. After Edward Snowden s revelations about the extent and depth of surveillance by the National Security Agency, it has become publicly evident that Silicon Valley is a vital node of the Deep State as well. Unlike military and intelligence contractors, Silicon Valley overwhelmingly sells to the private market, but its business is so important to the government that a strange relationship has emerged. While the government could simply dragoon the high technology companies to do the NSA s bidding, it would prefer cooperation with so important an engine of the nation s economy, perhaps with an implied quid pro quo. Perhaps this explains the extraordinary indulgence the government shows the Valley in intellectual property matters. If an American  jailbreaks  his smartphone (i.e., modifies it so that it can use a service provider other than the one dictated by the manufacturer), he could receive a fine of up to $500,000 and several years in prison; so much for a citizen s vaunted property rights to what he purchases. The libertarian pose of the Silicon Valley moguls, so carefully cultivated in their public relations, has always been a sham. Silicon Valley has long been tracking for commercial purposes the activities of every person who uses an electronic device, so it is hardly surprising that the Deep State should emulate the Valley and do the same for its own purposes. Nor is it surprising that it should conscript the Valley s assistance.Still, despite the essential roles of lower Manhattan and Silicon Valley, the center of gravity of the Deep State is firmly situated in and around the Beltway. The Deep State s physical expansion and consolidation around the Beltway would seem to make a mockery of the frequent pronouncement that governance in Washington is dysfunctional and broken. That the secret and unaccountable Deep State floats freely above the gridlock between both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue is the paradox of American government in the 21st century: drone strikes, data mining, secret prisons and Panopticon-like control on the one hand; and on the other, the ordinary, visible parliamentary institutions of self-government declining to the status of a banana republic amid the gradual collapse of public infrastructure.The results of this contradiction are not abstract, as a tour of the rotting, decaying, bankrupt cities of the American Midwest will attest. It is not even confined to those parts of the country left behind by a Washington Consensus that decreed the financialization and deindustrialization of the economy in the interests of efficiency and shareholder value. This paradox is evident even within the Beltway itself, the richest metropolitan area in the nation. Although demographers and urban researchers invariably count Washington as a  world city,  that is not always evident to those who live there. Virtually every time there is a severe summer thunderstorm, tens   or even hundreds   of thousands of residents lose power, often for many days. There are occasional water restrictions over wide areas because water mains, poorly constructed and inadequately maintained, have burst. [6] The Washington metropolitan area considers it a Herculean task just to build a rail link to its international airport   with luck it may be completed by 2018.It is as if Hadrian s Wall was still fully manned and the fortifications along the border with Germania were never stronger, even as the city of Rome disintegrates from within and the life-sustaining aqueducts leading down from the hills begin to crumble. The governing classes of the Deep State may continue to deceive themselves with their dreams of Zeus-like omnipotence, but others do not. A 2013 Pew Poll that interviewed 38,000 people around the world found that in 23 of 39 countries surveyed, a plurality of respondents said they believed China already had or would in the future replace the United States as the world s top economic power.The Deep State is the big story of our time. It is the red thread that runs through the war on terrorism, the financialization and deindustrialization of the American economy, the rise of a plutocratic social structure and political dysfunction. Washington is the headquarters of the Deep State, and its time in the sun as a rival to Rome, Constantinople or London may be term-limited by its overweening sense of self-importance and its habit, as Winwood Reade said of Rome, to  live upon its principal till ruin stared it in the face.   Living upon its principal,  in this case, means that the Deep State has been extracting value from the American people in vampire-like fashion.We are faced with two disagreeable implications. First, that the Deep State is so heavily entrenched, so well protected by surveillance, firepower, money and its ability to co-opt resistance that it is almost impervious to change. Second, that just as in so many previous empires, the Deep State is populated with those whose instinctive reaction to the failure of their policies is to double down on those very policies in the future. Iraq was a failure briefly camouflaged by the wholly propagandistic success of the so-called surge; this legerdemain allowed for the surge in Afghanistan, which equally came to naught. Undeterred by that failure, the functionaries of the Deep State plunged into Libya; the smoking rubble of the Benghazi consulate, rather than discouraging further misadventure, seemed merely to incite the itch to bomb Syria. Will the Deep State ride on the back of the American people from failure to failure until the country itself, despite its huge reserves of human and material capital, is slowly exhausted? The dusty road of empire is strewn with the bones of former great powers that exhausted themselves in like manner.But, there are signs of resistance to the Deep State and its demands. In the aftermath of the Snowden revelations, the House narrowly failed to pass an amendment that would have defunded the NSA s warrantless collection of data from US persons. Shortly thereafter, the president, advocating yet another military intervention in the Middle East, this time in Syria, met with such overwhelming congressional skepticism that he changed the subject by grasping at a diplomatic lifeline thrown to him by Vladimir Putin. [7]Has the visible, constitutional state, the one envisaged by Madison and the other Founders, finally begun to reassert itself against the claims and usurpations of the Deep State? To some extent, perhaps. The unfolding revelations of the scope of the NSA s warrantless surveillance have become so egregious that even institutional apologists such as Senator Dianne Feinstein have begun to backpedal   if only rhetorically   from their knee-jerk defense of the agency. As more people begin to waken from the fearful and suggestible state that 9/11 created in their minds, it is possible that the Deep State s decade-old tactic of crying  terrorism!  every time it faces resistance is no longer eliciting the same Pavlovian response of meek obedience. And the American people, possibly even their legislators, are growing tired of endless quagmires in the Middle East.But there is another more structural reason the Deep State may have peaked in the extent of its dominance. While it seems to float above the constitutional state, its essentially parasitic, extractive nature means that it is still tethered to the formal proceedings of governance. The Deep State thrives when there is tolerable functionality in the day-to-day operations of the federal government. As long as appropriations bills get passed on time, promotion lists get confirmed, black (i.e., secret) budgets get rubber-stamped, special tax subsidies for certain corporations are approved without controversy, as long as too many awkward questions are not asked, the gears of the hybrid state will mesh noiselessly. But when one house of Congress is taken over by tea party Wahhabites, life for the ruling class becomes more trying.If there is anything the Deep State requires it is silent, uninterrupted cash flow and the confidence that things will go on as they have in the past. It is even willing to tolerate a degree of gridlock: Partisan mud wrestling over cultural issues may be a useful distraction from its agenda. But recent congressional antics involving sequestration, the government shutdown and the threat of default over the debt ceiling extension have been disrupting that equilibrium. And an extreme gridlock dynamic has developed between the two parties such that continuing some level of sequestration is politically the least bad option for both parties, albeit for different reasons. As much as many Republicans might want to give budget relief to the organs of national security, they cannot fully reverse sequestration without the Democrats demanding revenue increases. And Democrats wanting to spend more on domestic discretionary programs cannot void sequestration on either domestic or defense programs without Republicans insisting on entitlement cuts.So, for the foreseeable future, the Deep State must restrain its appetite for taxpayer dollars. Limited deals may soften sequestration, but agency requests will not likely be fully funded anytime soon. Even Wall Street s rentier operations have been affected: After helping finance the tea party to advance its own plutocratic ambitions, America s Big Money is now regretting the Frankenstein s monster it has created. Like children playing with dynamite, the tea party and its compulsion to drive the nation into credit default has alarmed the grown-ups commanding the heights of capital; the latter are now telling the politicians they thought they had hired to knock it off.The House vote to defund the NSA s illegal surveillance programs was equally illustrative of the disruptive nature of the tea party insurgency. Civil liberties Democrats alone would never have come so close to victory; tea party stalwart Justin Amash (R-MI), who has also upset the business community for his debt-limit fundamentalism, was the lead Republican sponsor of the NSA amendment, and most of the Republicans who voted with him were aligned with the tea party.The final factor is Silicon Valley. Owing to secrecy and obfuscation, it is hard to know how much of the NSA s relationship with the Valley is based on voluntary cooperation, how much is legal compulsion through FISA warrants and how much is a matter of the NSA surreptitiously breaking into technology companies  systems. Given the Valley s public relations requirement to mollify its customers who have privacy concerns, it is difficult to take the tech firms  libertarian protestations about government compromise of their systems at face value, especially since they engage in similar activity against their own customers for commercial purposes. That said, evidence is accumulating that Silicon Valley is losing billions in overseas business from companies, individuals and governments that want to maintain privacy. For high tech entrepreneurs, the cash nexus is ultimately more compelling than the Deep State s demand for patriotic cooperation. Even legal compulsion can be combatted: Unlike the individual citizen, tech firms have deep pockets and batteries of lawyers with which to fight government diktat.This pushback has gone so far that on January 17, President Obama announced revisions to the NSA s data collection programs, including withdrawing the agency s custody of a domestic telephone record database, expanding requirements for judicial warrants and ceasing to spy on (undefined)  friendly foreign leaders.  Critics have denounced the changes as a cosmetic public relations move, but they are still significant in that the clamor has gotten so loud that the president feels the political need to address it.When the contradictions within a ruling ideology are pushed too far, factionalism appears and that ideology begins slowly to crumble. Corporate oligarchs such as the Koch brothers are no longer entirely happy with the faux-populist political front group they helped fund and groom. Silicon Valley, for all the Ayn Rand-like tendencies of its major players, its offshoring strategies and its further exacerbation of income inequality, is now lobbying Congress to restrain the NSA, a core component of the Deep State. Some tech firms are moving to encrypt their data. High tech corporations and governments alike seek dominance over people though collection of personal data, but the corporations are jumping ship now that adverse public reaction to the NSA scandals threatens their profits.The outcome of all these developments is uncertain. The Deep State, based on the twin pillars of national security imperative and corporate hegemony, has until recently seemed unshakable and the latest events may only be a temporary perturbation in its trajectory. But history has a way of toppling the altars of the mighty. While the two great materialist and determinist ideologies of the twentieth century, Marxism and the Washington Consensus, successively decreed that the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the market were inevitable, the future is actually indeterminate. It may be that deep economic and social currents create the framework of history, but those currents can be channeled, eddied, or even reversed by circumstance, chance and human agency. We have only to reflect upon defunct glacial despotisms such as the USSR or East Germany to realize that nothing is forever.Throughout history, state systems with outsized pretensions to power have reacted to their environments in two ways. The first strategy, reflecting the ossification of its ruling elites, consists of repeating that nothing is wrong, that the status quo reflects the nation s unique good fortune in being favored by God and that those calling for change are merely subversive troublemakers. As the French ancien r gime, the Romanov dynasty and the Habsburg emperors discovered, the strategy works splendidly for a while, particularly if one has a talent for dismissing unpleasant facts. The final results, however, are likely to be thoroughly disappointing.The second strategy is one embraced to varying degrees and with differing goals, by figures of such contrasting personalities as Mustafa Kemal Atat rk, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Charles de Gaulle and Deng Xiaoping. They were certainly not revolutionaries by temperament; if anything, their natures were conservative. But they understood that the political cultures in which they lived were fossilized and incapable of adapting to the times. In their drive to reform and modernize the political systems they inherited, their first obstacles to overcome were the outworn myths that encrusted the thinking of the elites of their time.As the United States confronts its future after experiencing two failed wars, a precarious economy and $17 trillion in accumulated debt, the national punditry has split into two camps. The first, the declinists, sees a broken, dysfunctional political system incapable of reform and an economy soon to be overtaken by China. The second, the reformers, offers a profusion of nostrums to turn the nation around: public financing of elections to sever the artery of money between the corporate components of the Deep State and financially dependent elected officials, government  insourcing  to reverse the tide of outsourcing of government functions and the conflicts of interest that it creates, a tax policy that values human labor over financial manipulation and a trade policy that favors exporting manufactured goods over exporting investment capital.All of that is necessary, but not sufficient. The Snowden revelations (the impact of which have been surprisingly strong), the derailed drive for military intervention in Syria and a fractious Congress, whose dysfunction has begun to be a serious inconvenience to the Deep State, show that there is now a deep but as yet inchoate hunger for change. What America lacks is a figure with the serene self-confidence to tell us that the twin idols of national security and corporate power are outworn dogmas that have nothing more to offer us. Thus disenthralled, the people themselves will unravel the Deep State with surprising speed. [1] The term  Deep State  was coined in Turkey and is said to be a system composed of high-level elements within the intelligence services, military, security, judiciary and organized crime. In British author John le Carr s latest novel, A Delicate Truth, a character describes the Deep State as   the ever-expanding circle of non-governmental insiders from banking, industry and commerce who were cleared for highly classified information denied to large swathes of Whitehall and Westminster.  I use the term to mean a hybrid association of elements of government and parts of top-level finance and industry that is effectively able to govern the United States without reference to the consent of the governed as expressed through the formal political process.  [2] Twenty-five years ago, the sociologist Robert Nisbet described this phenomenon as  the attribute of No Fault . Presidents, secretaries and generals and admirals in America seemingly subscribe to the doctrine that no fault ever attaches to policy and operations. This No Fault conviction prevents them from taking too seriously such notorious foul-ups as Desert One, Grenada, Lebanon and now the Persian Gulf.  To his list we might add 9/11, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.  [3] The attitude of many members of Congress towards Wall Street was memorably expressed by Rep. Spencer Bachus (R-AL), the incoming chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, in 2010:  In Washington, the view is that the banks are to be regulated, and my view is that Washington and the regulators are there to serve the banks.   [4] Beginning in 1988, every US president has been a graduate of Harvard or Yale. Beginning in 2000, every losing presidential candidate has been a Harvard or Yale graduate, with the exception of John McCain in 2008.  [5] In recent months, the American public has seen a vivid example of a Deep State operative marketing his ideology under the banner of pragmatism. Former Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates   a one-time career CIA officer and deeply political Bush family retainer   has camouflaged his retrospective defense of military escalations that have brought us nothing but casualties and fiscal grief as the straight-from-the-shoulder memoir from a plain-spoken son of Kansas who disdains Washington and its politicians.  [6] Meanwhile, the US government took the lead in restoring Baghdad s sewer system at a cost of $7 billion.  [7] Obama s abrupt about-face suggests he may have been skeptical of military intervention in Syria all along, but only dropped that policy once Congress and Putin gave him the running room to do so. In 2009, he went ahead with the Afghanistan  surge  partly because General Petraeus  public relations campaign and back-channel lobbying on the Hill for implementation of his pet military strategy pre-empted other options. These incidents raise the disturbing question of how much the democratically elected president   or any president   sets the policy of the national security state and how much the policy is set for him by the professional operatives of that state who engineer faits accomplis that force his hand.*** Author Mike Lofgren is a former career congressional staff member who served on the House and Senate budget committees.

5742, Hawaii Does What Republicans Won’t And Reduces The NRA To Wetting Themselves In Fear,"All Republicans had to do is ban suspected terrorists from buying guns and pass a universal background checks law. But they chose to listen to the NRA, and now states like Hawaii are bringing the hammer down on guns.The American people are demanding legislative action to prevent future mass shootings and reduce the number of gun violence incidents in this country. Simple fixes like universal background checks and banning terrorist suspects from buying guns legally would have satisfied most Americans.But because Republicans are owned by the NRA they refused to act and now all gun owners are paying the price for their failure to be responsible.Hawaii has the lowest gun death rate of any state in the nation and the island chain s strict gun laws are the main reason why.And now Governor David Ige has signed three bills that take gun regulations to another level.Introduced by Democratic state Rep. Will Espero, SB 2954 requires police to place the names of gun owners in the state in the FBI monitoring database so that law enforcement in Hawaii will be informed if any of their residents commit a crime wherever they go in the United States. So if a Hawaiian commits a crime in New York the police in Hawaii will be notified so they can determine if that person should still get to be in possession of firearms.In addition, HB 625 stalking and sexual harassment now disqualify people who commit these crimes from buying guns and HB 2632 requires people who have been diagnosed with major mental disorders to surrender their guns to authorities.In all, these three measures make it clear that Hawaii is done taking shit from the NRA.Of course, it didn t take long for the NRA to whine about the bills. The NRA Institute for Legislative Action, which really should change that last word to  Inaction,  predictably condemned the new laws. The exercise of an individual s Second Amendment rights is not inherently suspicious and should not require a person to surrender other civil liberties, including unwarranted invasions of privacy or unequal treatment under the law. The lawful acquisition, possession, carrying, or use of a firearm does not justify subjecting citizens to ongoing monitoring. Sorry, NRA. But that s what happens when you refuse to do anything reasonable to prevent gun violence other than offering  thoughts and prayers.  If you can t agree on anything to keep guns solely in the hands of responsible citizens, the government has the power and the right to do it without your support.NRA spokesperson Amy Hunter complained that the laws go too far, which is coming from an organization that believes ANY law restricting guns goes too far. As you can imagine, the NRA finds this one of the most extreme bills we ve ever seen,  she whined.At this point, if the NRA and their Republican puppets continue to refuse to do anything reasonable to reduce gun violence in this country, the states should do whatever it takes to make everyone as safe from gun violence as possible, even if it means putting every gun owner on an FBI list. Rep. Espero understands this and he s also a gun owner.Republicans and the NRA only have themselves to blame for not agreeing to be reasonable in the first place. They had a chance to DO something and they failed spectacularly. Now it s up to the states and Hawaii is setting an example for other states to follow.Featured image via Guns Wikia",News,"June 24, 2016"
22693,McPain: John McCain Furious That Iran Treated US Sailors Well,"21st Century Wire says As 21WIRE reported earlier this week, the unlikely  mishap  of two US Naval vessels straying into Iranian waters   just hours before the President s State of the Union speech, followed by the usual parade of arch-neocons coming on TV in real time to declare the incident as  an act of aggression  by Iran against the United States   is no mere coincidence.24 hours after the incident, the Iranians returned all 11 US sailors, unharmed and in good spirits. The only remaining casualty from this event was an incident of a common condition in Washington known as  Pre-Traumatic Stress Disorder    suffered by a certain US Senator was mortified by the uneventful outcome which followed Daniel McAdams Ron Paul Institute  The two US Navy riverine command boats intercepted in Iranian territorial waters yesterday were sent on their way along with the crew of 10 US sailors after brief detention on Iranian soil.According to news reports, the well-armed warships either suffered mechanical or navigational difficulties which caused them to enter Iranian territory (although it may well have been a game of cat-and-mouse to test the Iranian response). The US sailors were apparently treated well, enjoyed what appeared a decent meal in relaxed surroundings, and in the end apologized for the mistake and praised their treatment by the Iranians. Thanks to President Obama s policy shift on Iran toward engagement and away from isolationism, Secretary of State John Kerry was able to telephone his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Zarif and quickly defuse what just months ago would have been a far more serious situation.This should be a good-news story about the value of diplomacy and reducing tensions with adversaries, but Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) was having none of it. That Kerry expressed his appreciation to the Iranians for swiftly releasing the American sailors only showed the Obama Administration s  craven desire to preserve the dangerous Iranian nuclear deal at all costs evidently knows no limit,  said McCain in a press release.McCain was furious that  Obama administration officials seem to be falling over themselves to offer praise for Iran s graciousness  and was outraged that the Iranians dared interfere with the actions of US military vessels operating in Iranian waters.In the world of John McCain, only the United States has the right to national sovereignty. The US military has the right to act anywhere and everywhere and the rest of the world dare not raise a question.According to McCain,  sovereign immune naval vessels are exempt from detention, boarding, or search. Their crews are not subject to detention or arrest. Imagine the tune McCain would have been singing if a well-armed Iranian naval vessel had been spotted in US territorial waters off the coast of New York. Would he have so rigorously condemned any US interference in the actions of Iran s sovereign naval vessels?Leave it to some clever Twitterers to post an example of the difference between US and Iranian detention.Copyright   2016 by RonPaul Institute.

4101, GOP Lawmaker: ‘A Lady Needs To Be Told When She’s Being Nasty’,"A Texas lawmaker just defended Donald Trump s remark toward Hillary Clinton during the third and final presidential debate. Clinton was discussing Social Security and Medicare when Donald interrupted her to say the Democratic presidential nominee is  such a nasty woman.  Apparently Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX) agrees with Donald. You know what, she s saying some nasty things,  Babin told Alan Colmes on this show. You think it s appropriate to call her a nasty woman?  Colmes asked. Well, I m a genteel Southerner, Alan,  Babin replied. So that means no?  Colmes asked. The radio host had to repeatedly press Babin to answer the question. You re ducking me, Congressman,  Colmes said when Babit tried to pivot the topic to immigration. No, I think sometimes a lady needs to be told when she s being nasty. Oh, really?  Colmes asked.Babin replied,  I do. My assessment is that Mrs. Clinton has got so much baggage,  Babin continued.  I think she s done some nasty things. Colmes asked Babin about Trump s  rigged  election  rhetoric.  We re going to have to agree to disagree,  Babin said.The Texas lawmaker went on to blame the media for Trump s negative coverage.Colmes asked who he thought would win in November.  Im sure hoping that Mr. Trump wins,  Babin said.Audio courtesy of CNN:Babin initially backed Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) but later threw his support behind the GOP presidential nominee.We re glad that Babin brought up  nasty things.  Trump was recently outed in a video bragging about sexually assaulting women in 1995. Since then, he s gone on to call women fat, slobs, pigs and dogs. He s attacked his sexual assault accusers  looks. The man-baby candidate is whipping his supporters into a frenzy by telling crowds that the election is  rigged.   Trump is a Nasty Man. But thank you, Babin, for mansplaining that women need to be put in their place.The word  genteel  doesn t mean what the Texas lawmaker thinks it means.Image: Gage Skidmore via Flickr",News,"October 21, 2016"
